# Project Log 


## Week of 2/6

### 2/10
Looking into transformers rather than using gans. I found a pre-trained embedding space for which will allow me to not have to train one from scratch. [Link](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) to it here. Another [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-code-the-transformer-in-pytorch-24db27c8f9ec) about how to get started with transformers in pytorch.

I'm also looking into google vertex AI as a possible service to host my built model for when I want to push it. 
[Link](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) to google clouds Vertex API documentation. Another [Link](https://medium.com/@piyushpandey282/model-serving-at-scale-with-vertex-ai-custom-container-deployment-with-pre-and-post-processing-12ac62f4ce76) to a blog post about how to get a custom container pushed to their services
