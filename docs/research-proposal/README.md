# Research Proposal

## Initial 

## DS Area
This project will be an NLP project.

## General DS Skills Needed
Programming Languages
1. Python
1. possibly React.js for a standalone webpage

I will probably be using GCP to host my project.

For the Model, from what I've read, best practice is to use a either an RNN or a transformer for text generation. 

For the model the goal is to use tensorflow unless there is some reason I find later on for me not to.

## What I Already Know
I have taken Depalma's NLP class so I have some level of background in that area. I have also been in lectures with Graham Morehead where he explained the high level workings of an RNN and LSTM. I also have some level of working knowledge on how to use keras/tensorflow.

## What Will I Need to Learn
I will need to spend some time learning how to use either some sort of RNN(I will most likely use an RNN) or a transformer effectivley within tensorflow. 

There will also need to be some NLP specific techniques I need to learn like (BLEU score or Perplexity)

Deciding on which will be a part of my research. The goal is to find a pre-trained model to build off of rather than trying to source my massive corpus and train it from the ground up. 

Also, I will need to learn the twitter API. The article generator will be prompted by twitter posts so I need to learn how to retrieve that data.

GCP, for hosting my project

Finaly, if time permits, I would also like to learn Tableau and make a dashboard for the bots performance. 

## How Will I Learn These Topics
For now on the tensorflow front, my plan is to use the documentation provided through their website to learn what I need. They have tutorials and videos attached to the major algorithms. This will probably change as I work through the research.

For Tableau, the is an online course provided by them that I'm looking into. Given that this is not necessarily a part of my MVP, I may or may not get to this.

For GCP, there are many options to learn more about what their services can offer me. Below is a possible one

Here are the time estimates for each of these 
(NOTE these are high end estimates)
- Tensorflow: 
- Tableau: 82 hrs
