"title: (UPDATE) AITA for telling my step-daughter to “go ask her real dad” when she asked me to pay for her plane tickets?

Hey guys. It’s been a good 2 weeks since I’ve posted and I figured you guys would like an update. A lot has happened since the last time I posted

So that night, I did what many of the comments suggested I do, which was to apologize. I told her that I’m sorry that implying that I’m not her real father, but like it or not that I consider her MY daughter. That I loved her and will always be there for her. She started to cry and sob uncontrollably and said “Why doesn’t he [her biological father] love me?” I held her and told her she didn’t need to fight for his approval. I also apologized for looking through her phone; that I’ve come to accept that it’s not an appropriate punishment for a teenage girl, and I was going to find other alternatives. Lastly I brought up therapy and while she was hesitant at first I let her know it was nothing to be ashamed of, that everything she said at therapy would be entirely confidential, and that it could help to have a confidant to help her sort through her feelings. She sat on this for the day, but the next day let me know that she was ready so I set up the soonest appointment (which was last Friday and her second appointment this afternoon)

It’s only been a week so I don’t want to get too optimistic but honestly I feel like I’m noticing an improvement already. She’s actually been engaging back in small talk when normally she wouldn’t give me the time of day. She’s been following all of the rules, coming home at a reasonable hour, she’s been less withdrawn and more social even to the point where her brother commented on the change today! But the most exciting news of them all is when getting out the car on her way home from therapy, she said and I quote “thanks dad”. She’s never called me dad before so honestly I’ve been riding off that high for the last two hours 

I’m not delusional enough to think everything’s peachy but honestly the behavior change in the last week was the most progress we’ve had since, well, ever. I’m cautiously optimistic going forward. 

Thanks again everyone for your comments, especially the ones who gave me the kick in the ass I needed.",nta
"title: AITA (22M) for telling my mom (46F) to fuck off?
content: I lost my job two weeks ago due to redundancy. I had to move back in with her and her (shitty) boyfriend. 

Long story short, she called me three words which made me go the fuck off: A psychopath, weird, antisocial. A psychopath because I have no empathy for her, weird because I don't find her humour funny, and antisocial because I choose to sit in my room than with them in the Livingroom. 

Why do I have no empathy for her? Her alcoholism, combined with her irrationality, impulsiveness and emotional  manipulativeness made me create a shell around me when I was younger. I'm afraid I overall feel very little now to protect myself, but this isn't the sub for that. This, combined with her choosing her abusive boyfriend over me when I was younger, made me really distant to her. 

Why did I not find her humour funny? She made fun of me for my poor native language (it's not English, which I use very little of now) in front of her boyfriend - specifically pointing out each pronunciation and telling me I should spend more time learning than sitting in my room. I obviously don't make comments about her English, or lack thereof, but it is what it is. When I didn't say anything, she just kept repeating how I'm boring and weird. 

Why do I sit in my room, as opposed to with them? Because my moms boyfriend abused me when I was younger and I never forgave him, and my mom is a piece of fucking shit that belittles me and makes me feel like shit. 

Anyways, I looked her in the eyes - probably the first time in a while - and just told her to fuck off. Dead in her soul, and just said those words. She probably could have stabbed me then and there. Or maybe she felt a dagger herself as her only son and the only one who believed in her, just pushed the barrier between us even further. 

She just makes me feel shit... I've had managers who were more parental than her... She will make me feel so shit, and when I politely point out what she said was unhealthy for my mind and overall state, the conversation turns to her telling me how I'm attacking her! It feels that there is no such thing as healthy communication? 

So... Am I the asshole? I can still hear them talking about it downstairs... :(",nta
"title: AITA (31F) for not wanting to go out drinking alcohol with my girlfriend (33F) all day to celebrate her birthday which is in 6 weeks time?
content: Me and my girlfriend Karla (fake name) live in a suburb of Los Angeles.

She's 34 in 6 weeks time, and she said to celebrate she wants to do an all-day drinking binge and visiting of takeaway pizza and taco places, starting at 9am and finishing at midnight.

She expects me to do this with her, we go to all the bars and dive bars we can fit in.

We're a femme lesbian couple who've been together for 5 years and moved in together by summer 2019. If that makes any sense, we were together for 18 months, moved in by summer 2019.
Just as well, as by winter 2019, COVID-19 was starting to be in the news, wasn't it?

I met Karla in 2018 in a dive bar and she was sad that no women approached her, only old guys in their 50s with beards, not beautiful young women like me (her words not mine!); said it was good for beer, poor for dates.

I've told her no, but she said ""I did what you wanted for your birthday, all the fashion and lingerie stores, and it was fucking awesome, but I've never done this before, and it's worth a go. The pandemic made me realize life's too short."".

She's just as into femme fashion as me - we're lesbian and don't fit the mold of masculine-feminine lesbian couples.

We're both self-employed, so no bosses to tell about this.

I'm worried it'll make us feel ill, but she claims ""When I was sixteen, I ate a load of M&M's packets - about 20 and eight bags of tortilla chips - to cope with realizing I was lesbian and realizing it was OK, and I didn't suffer any ill effects. This is it, but on a bigger scale.""

The big question is, AITA for being concerned over this?

"title: AITA (39F) for NOT wanting to move to Las Vegas from New Jersey now my husband (38M) has got a job there and worrying over finding a job and culture shock?
content: Hello there. I've been with my husband for 12 years now but we've been together for 15 years in total.

In April, my husband left his Manhattan-based job because it was too work-from-home focused and he had no guarantee he could return to the office from the employer. He said working from home didn't work for him. It wasn't explicitly a fuck-you, but him sticking to his principles. Since then, he's been trying to look for work, but didn't get to interview stages with some employers.

He did tell me he had to go to Las Vegas for an interview, so I helped him last month look for cheap flights and get ready, he said he'd applied for a job in a casino (what it was, I forgot). He went, and said it went well, but didn't hear anything back from them...

Until last Friday, when he's announced he's got the job in the casino.

If anything, I'd expected him to get the job in New Brunswick he applied for - a position that couldn't be done as WFH (it involved driving a Chevy Express van).

He's not a croupier or anything like that, his role's more behind-the-scenes at a smaller, more obscure casino on the city limits of Las Vegas. It's a tourist attraction but overshadowed by the giant casinos. IIRC, it's tribal-owned but not on a tribal reservation, close to a fast food joint, so my husband tells me.

Anyway, if I'm being honest here, I'm not sure I WANT to move to Las Vegas.

I've worked for 16 years with adults who have autism spectrum disorder (before that was a waitress in a Mexican restaurant) and am now a social worker (not in a group home or day center); I've been one for the past 9 years. I'm self-employed.

I'm worried I won't be able to find work in my career in Las Vegas. Currently I'm licensed only here in New Jersey (the part bordering Manhattan); we live near New Brunswick.

I want to continue what I do, not get a job in fast food or service job, my job is an essential job in many ways and I like what I do. Being my own boss is hard but rewarding.

My job is rewarding, but hard work at times, and obviously can't be done from home. FWIW, some of the people involved don't even understand what Zoom is or use it so doing remote work isn't possible. I couldn't work during the pandemic when people were suggesting working from home. My job REQUIRED in-person contact.

I've told my husband we need to have a ""big talk"" about the realities of life in Las Vegas and how hard it'll be for me to find a job, but was pleased about the fact he'd applied for a job and refused to give up in these challenging times and stuck to his principles.

If anything, won't Las Vegas be a culture shock to two New Jerseyans like ourselves?

I worry about two things; finding a job and not fitting in culturally with the locals (IIRC, parts of my state are considered culturally similar to Southern states).

AITA here, or is this a case of ESH?

I expect I may get a judgment I don't like, but I am asking for honest, open advice.

"title: AITA (F25) for telling my bridesmaid (F22) that I understand if she can’t make it to my wedding?
content: I’m going to try my best to detail this as clear and short as possible. One of my bridesmaids found out she was pregnant in December, and has been struggling financially ever since. She’s unemployed, has a boyfriend (M28) who works two jobs, yet they still struggle. 

Her and I hung out at my house yesterday and the wedding casually came up in conversation, the baby/nursery/baby shower came up a few times, and then she kept steering conversation back to the wedding. She asked me if we were still doing it out of state, I said yes. She asked how much it would be, I said no more than $400 a couple. I reiterated that guests don’t need to worry about accommodations, food, or transportation. All they need to worry about is plane tickets. 

The wedding has been set in stone for 4 months and she knew all the details already. She’s literally a bridesmaid! The confusion and topic of expenses led me to believe that she had not bought her plane tickets yet, and maybe was asking these questions as a financial reassurance for herself. Then I started realizing that a big trip like this would be financially stressful only 3 months after giving birth, which is what she’d be going through if she was to come, so maybe she was weary about attending overall. 

Now this is where I feel I may have been the asshole. I believe I may have assumed far too much. I nicely told her that if she couldn’t make it due to the baby or financial difficulties that I’d completely understand and wouldn’t hold it against her. She immediately got angry, called me a bad friend and started crying.

I was more confused because I thought I was being a good friend. I explained that I didn’t intend to upset her and that I was sorry for clearly hurting her feelings somehow. She then *screamed* that if I was truly her friend, I would want her to come so bad that I’d pay her way, including her plus 2. I was stunned and offended. Important: Back in January I payed her way for my bachelorette trip because she had just found out she was pregnant and I wanted to help out. 
It was almost like my friendly gesture of paying her way for the trip nipped me in the ass, because now she expects me to pay her way this time. She then storms out of my house and drives away. I woke up to her calling me names like crappy friend, selfish, and judgmental. I’m completely lost for words which has led me here. 

AITA for telling my bridesmaid that I understand if she can’t make it to my wedding, ultimately not immediately offering to pay her way like I have before? Though, I feel maybe I should have been more upfront and just asked her why she was asking those questions instead of assuming why. Maybe that route would’ve led to a whole different “vibe” within the conversation..I don’t know.",nta
"title: AITA - I canceled my wedding bc my parents
content:  AITA? My  brother got engaged in September 2022; through an arranged marriage my parents setup. I was told he was lonely living alone in the midwest so he wanted companionship. At the time of his engagement, I was estranged from my whole family (mom, dad, two sisters, brother and 5 niece and nephew) because my mom kicked me out of the family for screaming at her for not picking me up after my ectopic pregnancy and emergency surgery to have my falopian tube removed. So the entire family didn't speak to me for 13 month; my father would call me every two months, basically to make sure i'm alive and so he could ask me to lend him $2000.

In November of 2022 my dad called me up and basically said ""your brother is engaged, we are doing the marriage ceremony on Christmas eve and we want you there. Also, how long are you going to live without family?"" (Like i was the one that choice to get kicked out?) So fine I come back to the family, I say nothing about the whole ignoring me and treating me like i'm dead and they act like nothing has happened and we are all best friends. My brother has his religious marriage ceremony and his wedding reception is planned for July 2023.

I got engaged January 1, 2023. Together for four years, changed his religion for me, My dad wouldn't even let him propose to me until after Dec. 31 bc he didn't want to spoil my brother spotlight. Fine, he waited. 

We wanted to get married the first weekend in September so our wedding day would land on our dating anniversary. My mom made me move it to a week after my brothers bc she said it wasn't fair to make our family overseas; fly to America twice in one year.

I'm kind of over it, when my brothers college girlfriend that we thought dumped him; messages my on Instagram. She tells me that my brother is still texting her, sharing his location, says he has NOT gotten married and still loves her, he literally told her that the night before when he was next to his wife. She even tells me she was living with him until December 19. My brother isn't in love, he doesn't care about anyone but himself and is ruining my wedding.

My fiancé called my Dad up and told him he needed to get his son in line. Instead everything gets turned around about how i'm a nasty girl that sleeps around and my brother is innocent and his EX is using him. My Dad turned everything around about why i'm bad, but when my fiancé would point out his son does the same thing; my father used the logic that i'm a successful executive at a billion dollar company and have more sense so I should know better.

When my fiancé tried to explain to my parents how it hurt my feelings that they ignore me; my Dad said they don't care about my feelings; that i have no morals, have no loyalty for my family and I'm now orphaned. My father also told my fiancé to let me know my parents are dead to me. So i canceled my make-up artist, DJ, wedding hall and changed my phone number so my family can never contact me again",yta
"title: AITA - I missed my daughter’s award ceremony because of my son, she’s still not speaking to me
content: This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

I’ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He’s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He’s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it’s helped somewhat.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son’s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. 

Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn’t leave, and he wasn’t calm for hours. I’d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I’d missed every game and performance she’d had as a child and it clearly wasn’t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can’t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I’ve barely spoken with her since. She didn’t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn’t shown up for holidays and I’ve heard she’s engaged but didn’t call to tell me. She’s cut us out, and in the one of three times we’ve spoken since she said it’s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn’t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. 

AITA - I’ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn’t a perfect mom growing up - I didn’t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I’m heartbroken but I don’t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",yta
"title: AITA 30f for refusing to clean up cat shit
content: I 30f am 2 months pregnant. I work in a house keeping setting and currently have a client who lives with family, the client has an indoor outdoor cat as well as other family members have indoor outdoor cats. I’ve never seen their liter box but from my understanding they only have one for like three cats, which I explained to my client might be adding to the issue and suggested we get a box to keep in their room. One or more of the cats starting taking dumps on my clients bedroom floor. The company I work for requires me to clean, but clearly states I do not have to clean up after animals (no feces, urine, no liter boxes, no food) I am there to provide services for the client, but not their pet. The pet thing is my choice if I want to do it but I do not have too. Now normally I have just cleaned up the shit, I don’t mind as it takes less than 5 minutes and honestly it’s just not that big of a deal to me. Is it gross? Sure, but I’m not the type to generally make a fuss and I don’t mind helping out where I can. However since finding out I am pregnant I have refused to clean up the poop because of the risk of that toxoplasmosis or whatever it’s called, they say pregnant woman shouldn’t clean litter boxes so I’m just not doing it. Everyone in the house is upset at me, and it’s making me feel bad but I don’t want to being potential risk to my unborn baby. I am worried they may try to call and complain to the company, which is they complain I won’t clean to cat poop they will be told I don’t have too but I dont know if they would try to say other things like lie or anything like that. Am I the asshole here for refusing to clean up? I asked my client to get one of his many family members to do it for them but none of them do anything for them and they are old and can’t really walk well…I feel sort of at a loss on how to handle the situation 

Tdlr; I am pregnant and don’t want to clean cat poop but my client and their family wants me to and are mad at me for refusing.",info

It was our grandmother. I had spent so much more time with her than this aunt and this really aggravated me. She proceeded to block my sister and I on all accounts, but not our SOs. She will like and comment on photos of my fiancee as long as I am not in the photo as well. She is fucking petty. Basically I convinced my parents to allow me to not invite her to the ceremony but she is still invited to the reception. I really don't want her there but I Also want my dad to enjoy the event with his family. AITA for not wanting her there and planning on not speaking to her at my reception?",info
"title: AITA For Asking My Boyfriend why he continues to pay for a child that isn't his? Causing him to stop?
content: context:  
OP (me) F28  
Boyfriend M24  
Marko- Boyfriend's bio child 2yrs  
Polo- boyfriend's ex's child (no relation to bf)  
baby moma- bf's ex. The mother of marko and polo.

I (OP) and boyfriend have been seeing each other for only about 3 weeks, an admittedly short amount of time. 

The issue arises however with Polo- or the mother's expectations involving this child.  
Polo is baby moma's 1st son and belongs to a deadbeat who lives out of town and has never been in Polo's life.

Boyfriend spent about 3 yrs IN Polo's life as a male adult figure while in a relationship with baby moma.  Since they've split-he only sees Polo if he happens to be with Marko.

Last night, baby moma contacted boyfriend and just told him ""you're taking the boys tonight"" and this upset him. He said he struggles to care for two children on his own can't afford it.  Confused I asked ""I thought only Marko was yours?""

He confirmed, only Marko was his but he feels responsible for Polo as he was involved in his life from a young age.

We discussed Polo's father and I expressed my distaste for fathers who don't step up for their own children. Saying something along the lines of ""why does his dad get no responsibility? He should be feeling this obligation, not you.""

Boyfriend then told Baby Moma he will take Marko absolutely no issue, but said he's no longer going to be held responsible for Polo.

Baby Moma then basically said ""cool you're never seeing your son again""; then made threats to call local child care organizations and has been blasting him on facebook calling him a deadbeat dad.

I am a childless woman-I won't even begin to pretend I understand how complicated her situation must be. However I am childless because-I choose to be. Meaning I've never just been like ""oops I guess I'm pregnant"" and have always found it fairly easy to just-not get knocked up. So I have little sympathy for this next detail:

\- She's currently pregnant with a 3rd child from a 3rd baby daddy - and has no idea who it is. And FULLY EXPECTS BOYFRIEND TO CARE FOR THIS NEW 3RD CHILD!  
One conceived AFTER they broke up by another man!  
Its clear to me that this woman will expect boyfriend to pay for and care for ANY child she has now or in the future because he's a good man. To her it has nothing to do with who was there for Polo or Marko its who will pay the child support.

I feel like my comment was the final straw. I'm worried I should have kept my mouth shut.  
But I was genuinely just-making light conversation. I never said ""you should do xyz""

I also really hate that because he wouldn't take both children, he wasn't permitted to see HIS child.  
AITA? Does everyone here suck? Should I have kept my comment to myself?",nta
"title: AITA For Attacking My Dad?
content: I, (13) have a really hard time getting to school due to my intense ADHD, depression, and anxiety. I made a plan with an emotional support teacher, who Ill call K. I emailed K to make a plan about getting into school for the week. I met up with him and we had a good chat and then I went home with my dad. Everything was normal for the rest of the day but the next day it got real. I had a really hard time getting out of bed and getting up for school, I did my normal morning routine and then I sat down with my dad. We talked for a bit about different times I could get in to school but I was anxious about coming in. Now, for a bit of explaining. When most people think about ADHD they think about people who have attention issues, people who are hyper, etc, but for me, I have a more emotional type. With this emotional type of ADHD I have comes this strange tick, when this happens my body basically shuts down, I'm unable to move my body essentially. While talking with my dad he brings up a topic about school (Which I'm not going to say for personal reasons) and this exact tick came. When this tick normally happens I can sometimes non verbally signal to my parents whats going on (other times they can just notice). When I get this tick, my parents come over and help me calm down, but my dad, despite clearly knowing whats happening brings something up. As I mentioned before I met up with K, in the meeting with K we agreed on meeting the next day. And clearly by now it was obvious that that wasn't going to happen. And my dad said ""When you make plans you need to follow through with them"" My dad has said this a lot throughout the last few weeks when I wasn't able to follow through with what I agreed to do. Normally it makes me mad when he says it as he knows why I cant follow through with stuff like this, but this time I snapped. I lusted forward and hit him and started yelling at him. Now, I want you to know that I'm not a very strong person as I'm only 13, so this hit didn't affect him what so ever as he is a gymnast. 

NOTE: I know the rules say no violence so I put this as a NSFW post. Also I'm not sure sure if this 100% counts as violence as it didn't affect my dad at all. So sorry if I broke the rules I'm new to reddit and I dont really know what I'm doing",yta
"title: AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight?
content: So here is the situation.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. 

AITA

Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. 

Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. 

Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",info
"title: AITA For Ditching my Friends to Hang Out With a Boy?
content: For context I was in high school when this happened. I think I was 16 at the time. 

Now when I say I ditched them, that part was true. However we were on our way to get a ""five-finger discount"" if you will. We were awful I admit and I stopped after what happened in this case. I should have known better anyways because one of the girls I was with actually got arrested not too long before this incident for shoplifting from a walgreens and almost got me arrested too, except this time I didn't steal anything nor had I indented to so they let me go. 

The boy I'd been messing around with at the time knew what we were doing and asked me to hang out with him instead because I shouldn't be doing stupid shit like this. And I did. I hopped in his car and we drove off. 

We see my friends again later about to walk into the store and they were annoyed with me for ditching them and said I acted like we were gonna get caught and that I was scared and as their friend if they go down I should go down too, not ditch them for a boy. We through some light-hearted digs at each other and went on our way. 

The next morning at school I don't see the two friends I was with. Another friend asked me if I knew what happened and apparently a manager recognized my friends when they walked in and got an employee to follow them as if they were a normal shopper, caught everything they were stealing, and the police stopped them on the way out where they were arrested. The following day they returned to school and didn't want to talk to me because I should have been there with them but I wanted to ""get some dick"" instead. I didn't feel bad though, I was honestly grateful that he asked me to go with him when he did or I would have been in that same boat and them getting caught stealing in a place they go to every day and leave with nothing wasn't my problem at that point.",nta
"title: AITA For Exposing My Neighbors' Crappy Behavior To Their Friends
content:  I live in a small town with a lot of gossip. Rumors spread like wildfire in our town. At every get-together, you are sure to hear many stories that start with ""So and so told me that..."", which I honestly hate.

As most people already know, rumors always get worse over time. Stories never stay the same.

I usually ignore rumors as much as possible, mostly because I couldn't care less who cheated or who lied. I try to stay away from the drama and I don't engage when people try to tell me about all of the crappy stuff some random person did

That being said, in the past few years, I started noticing that stuff I told my parents in private started circulating as well. There have been multiple instances where someone I didn't know would stop me in the street to hear about a situation that was going on in my family at the time. They'd tell me that someone told them about it, but I would never get a clear answer as to who told them, probably because the origins of a rumor are always hard to trace. I suspected that my elderly neighbors had been eavesdropping and sharing the information with others because they will always have a reason to be outside whenever one of us is outside. They will randomly insert themselves into the conversation we are having and ask us personal questions or they will ask for details on the situation even if they have nothing to do with it.

Upon talking to the other neighbors we discovered that other people had the same issue.

We have confronted our neighbors in private before, telling them to keep their noses out of our business. If we want outsiders to know what’s going on in our private lives, we’ll tell them ourselves. We don’t need or want them doing that for us.

A week ago my dog passed away. My neighbors came over that afternoon to demand details. We refused to share details and they backed off.

Yesterday, a random person I didn’t know asked about my dog. When I asked them how they knew about it, they told me that - according to our neighbor - I had been almost desperate to share this information with her. I was told that “I needed someone to talk to, so my neighbor allowed me to vent”. I got really mad and told this woman that my neighbor had been eavesdropping.

This afternoon our neighbors came walking in, accusing me of “trying to make them look bad” to their friend. They said I should have told them that I didn’t remember talking about it. Saying that they eavesdropped made them look like bad people. I told them that I was not going to lie and that they did, in fact, eavesdrop.

My parents backed me up, saying that I did the right thing.

The neighbors have to pass through our backyard to get to their back door, and when my dad checked the garden, he saw that our dog’s grave had been destroyed. This caused a fight ending with my neighbors saying that we would be excluded from neighborhood parties going forward. We said that we were fine with that.",nta
"title: AITA For Firing An Employee After His Parents Died?
content: I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

AITA?

\*\*Update\*\*\*

Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",yta
"title: AITA For Going to NYC W/O BFF After She Declined
content: My best friend “Ellen”(33F) and I (29F) have always talked about going to NYC together and how special it would be for me to experience my first time with her. NYC became special bc of all the food options and we are two big foodies. She moved from CO to Maryland in 2016 with her husband bc of his job. I have tried to plan this NYC trip with her 3x. 

First time for Sept 2021, but she didn’t want to go since she was already going with another friend a month prior. I was understanding and said we will try for another time. 

Second time was out of the blue since my  SO’s (Ben) best college friend “Kelly” reached out to him to see if we would like to meet in NYC and go apple picking. I was excited for this opportunity to meet Kelly and experience NYC with Ellen. I texted Ellen the dates and see if she and her husband would like to join us. She sounded excited until I told her that Kelly would be meeting us too. She told me that she won’t join us. Later on she voiced that she didn’t like how she was being invited to someone else’s plans. I sympathize and understood. This didn’t happen after all since our traveling schedule was too hectic.

Final attempt… I felt Ben needed to see Kelly since it’s been two years. I also wanted to experience NYC with Ellen. I checked flights on Southwest. I had points and it was dirt cheap. I booked it then reached out to Ellen. She declined because she didn’t felt like the hassle she would have to go through wouldn’t be worth it for a trip she didn’t think would be fun. So we went without them and had a blast. 

So AITA? She is very hurt and upset still 8 months after our trip bc she felt like an after thought. That I planned the trip AND then invited her. 

I am going to have a phone call with her soon to discuss this and other issues. 
Please give me your input bc I don’t think I did anything wrong. Thank you!


UPDATE 

We had a two hour long phone call. This is normal for us 😅. Anyways, one of our topics was NYC. Prior to this phone call I sent a really long response to her about our initial phone call about NYC. In the text I broke NYC down like I did in this post and that she was never an after thought. She doesn’t remember the specifics of events or saying she didn’t think it was going to be fun. All she remember is how it all made her feel. This indicated to me that we are approaching this topic differently. She was running with her emotions and I am the type of person who takes on the facts then bring in the emotions and to be rational with everything. I told her I understand and can sympathize why she feels this way, but logically it doesn’t make sense to conclude to this bc I look necessary steps to plan NYC. I told her I can’t give her an apology bc I didn’t do anything wrong. That she will have to sort through her emotions. We agreed and respected each other. 

To answer some comments

Ellen never invited me to NYC bc she was waiting for me on my terms and availability. Three years ago I became financially independent from an ex husband. 

Ellen does show signs of only child syndrome… so yes sometimes she does want things to go a certain way even if she doesn’t admit to it. Lol This is a small flaw in an amazing person. She has had my back for 10yrs. 

I did bring up to her in my response that I felt like it was a double standard for her to be able to go on NYC with others, but it’s not okay for me too. This wasn’t brought up again in our phone call. 

Thank you guys so much for your input. I try my hardest to understand others perspectives. I knew I wasn’t the asshole, but felt maybe I was being bias and needed to be put in check. Honestly, it would have been so much easier to apologize. But I can’t apologize if it’s not genuine/ I wasn’t in the wrong. Lol but seriously thank you all 🙏🏽. I was freaking out 😅",nta
"title: AITA For Not Appreciating BFs Help
content: So the division of chores in our house is I do the laundry and pick/clean up everything and do half the cooking. My BF does the other half of cooking and dishes, and will help clean on weekends he’s home. Lately he’s been busy so I’ve been doing dishes from dinner or breakfast more frequently in the mornings. I’m in college and only work part time, so when he leaves in the morning I clean everything because I find a dirty house to be distracting when I study. He would prefer I leave the house dirty until he gets home and can help clean. When I do the dishes, I use the dishwasher for plates, silverware, etc and hand wash pans, cutting boards, knives, etc. when he does dishes he hand washes everything. 
This morning we ate breakfast, and he actually had time to do the dishes, but he wanted me to hand dry them while he washed. I got upset because I knew I had 3 other chores to complete this morning. This is where I may be the AH because I grumbled something about washing the dishes together is not very helpful. To me it would take me just as long to throw them in the dishwasher myself and unload them later as it would be to hand dry everything. He called me rude and said I hurt his feelings because he was trying to be sweet to help me out this morning when he wanted to get to work early. I feel that I could’ve used better language but I’m not the AH because dishes are his responsibility and not something he is sweet for doing. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA For Refusing To Crochet Something For My Brother's Future Baby After Years Of Teasing?
content: Throwaway Account

I (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.

When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.

After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.

When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.

My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?

Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.

Edit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college.",nta
"title: AITA For Refusing to Give My Brother My Dead Uncle's Painting?
content: My brother purchased my aunt and uncle's condo from our overseas cousin after they both passed away. My cousin cleared out almost everything except for a few items, including his high school memorabilia, videotapes, my uncle's paintings, and a few other things that my brother was supposed to send to him. Instead, time slipped by without any action on my brother's part.

About eight years later, I found my uncle's beautiful paintings carelessly placed by a puddle in our parents' garage. It turns out that my brother had left them there while they were out of the country. I expressed my concerns to my parents, who didn't know what to do with the paintings. I decided to take one and leave the rest.

When my parents visited my apartment and saw the painting, they had mixed reactions. My mom moved the remaining paintings inside their house to avoid further damage. Later, when my cousin visited for my dad's funeral, he mentioned that he didn't really want the paintings, but there was one in particular that he desired—a portrait of his late brother.

Frustrated by the negligence of the paintings for an entire decade, I took the three remaining landscape paintings and left the portrait for my cousin. I didn't discuss it with anyone since my cousin didn't care about the rest, and my brother had already shown his disregard by dumping them in the garage.

I displayed the four paintings in my apartment, and they looked fantastic. However, when my brother purchased a house in addition to his condo, he suddenly expressed interest in one of the paintings. He texted me, asking if I had taken them, and I confirmed that I had. When he requested one, I reminded him of the years of neglect, and he tried to argue, but I didn't respond.

The next time we met at my mom's house, my brother confronted me about the paintings, and I stood my ground, telling him he had his chance. He lost his temper, yelling insults and threatening to take something important from me. I left, feeling frustrated.

Later, my mom called and blamed me for the situation, saying I should have told her about taking the paintings from her house. She didn't consider them hers, and my brother never asked for permission when he left them there. Now, after his hostile reaction and threats, I refuse to give him a painting. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to give him even one painting despite his years of neglect and no desire to have them for over a decade?",info
"title: AITA For Telling My Cousin That She's The Reason My Husband And I Have Re-Considered Adoption?
content: Throwaway Account   


I (33f) have had fertility issues for the past couple of years with my husband (35m). We went through with consultations and while we had very promising results for treatment the cost did give us pause. It wasn't that we couldn't afford it we just weren't at the point yet where we were willing to pay. I discussed it with my husband and we were both fine with the idea of adopting. 

My cousin Tiffany (25f) is adopted and she supported our choice in looking into it. However this was a couple of years back and during that time Tiffany was reunited with her birth parents and she's been acting pretty hurtful to my aunt and uncle since then. She keeps making post about how happy she is to know where she comes from and is happy about being reunited with her ""real family."" She even talked about having her birth father walk her down the aisle as a chance to make up for lost time. Obviously my uncle was very hurt about this but went he voiced it Tiffany got defensive. She called my uncle selfish, how this was about her and that he knew what he signed up for when raising someone else's kid.

Before the pandemic Tiffany moved closer to where her bio mother lived so they could make up for lost time, and Tiffany kept making post after post about all the fun she was having meeting relatives, and how she called/video chatted with each of her bio parents multiple times a week meanwhile she barely texted back my uncle and aunt once a month. I could tell how heartbroken my aunt and uncle were but tried to give Tiffany her space and the few times they said anything she accuse them of being selfish and unsupportive. I think the biggest thing that broke them was when Tiffany promised to come by for my aunt's birthday (COVID restrictions were lifted) and was even given the money to travel to them but then never showed up. She called literally the day before to say that her bio mom had an emergency so she wasn't going to make it, but didn't give back the money. 

I am completely disgusted by Tiffany's behavior and while I haven't completely ruled out adoption entirely I did want to give medical assisted conception a try. My husband supported this and we are now currently expecting. After we made our announcement Tiffany messaged me asking why I would spend thousands on creating a child when I could helped one who already existed. I tried to play it off but Tiffany kept pressing and calling me a bad person when there are so many children who desperately need a home and overpopulation. It got to the point where she was pissing me off and I just came clean and said that her behavior towards the people who loved and raised her was the reason. Tiffany got really upset but I didn't care, however, her parents are now starting to say that I was wrong so AITA?",nta

"title: AITA For being jealous of my sister?
content: Hello My name is C, I’m going to need to give a little context to start explaining my situation so please forgive the paragraph…. When I was still in high school I learned that I needed to find a first car. At the time I didn’t know who else to turn to so I asked to my dad to help out with my first car, I thought that we could find something I could save for…I didn’t learn how to drive until I was 18 and when I did eventually have to buy my first car because it was from my Dads therapist. I expressed my concern and told my Dad that I wanted to save for a car I really wanted instead of something that was just forced upon me. Despite my concerns we got the car because that’s what my Dad thought would be affordable and it’s what he wanted. I bought the car for 2k so I can’t complain too much. Although it was affordable the car  I’ve been struggling to maintain everything. It’s been misfiring and had mechanical problems for the last 4 years now.  I’ve tried expressing my frustration with the situation time and time again but I’m getting to the point where I feel like it doesn’t even matter anymore. At the beginning of the year I had to help my dad out with taxes and he had told me to file for dependents on my tax return. In doing so we got a larger tax return this year and my Dad’s had been keeping the money in his savings account so he could get my younger sister her dream car. He had been stressing out a lot trying to find it in our price range so I even helped him do the research and found the car that we ended up buying. My Dad can’t drive so I was basically forced to drive to tag along and bring my sisters new car back home despite the fact that I was uncomfortable about the situation in the first place. I’m somebody who has a hard time with driving on the road because of my disability so I really went out of my way to show I cared by driving a car I wasn’t used to. I had to drive an hour back home anxiety ridden and uncomfortable in my sisters new convertible car that’s worth like 6k. Compared to what i was used to with my own car it felt like a very different experience. I didn’t wanna express it to anyone but I was slightly jealous that my sister was getting her dream car at the age of 15. Nonetheless I was really happy for her so I was trying to keep the emotion to myself when I had gotten back to the house after the hour long drive. Despite my efforts of trying to keep these feelings to myself my Dad called me out for feeling the way I did and I was called disgusting for being honest with him about it. I feel like I let my sister down and ruined my 
 chances of being a good brother that my siblings can look up to. My dad thinks I can’t be happy for other people and it makes me really mad at myself, I just wish I didn’t have to be this way",nta

I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

Today when she said ""morning slim"" I replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"".

"title: AITA For giving away a bunk bed that I could have sold in order to help my sister-in-law and brother with their rent?
content: (Fake names for anonymity)

My sister-in-law “Fae” and brother “Max” had recently struggled to afford their rent, as it went up. They received the standard 90 day notice from their landlady, but still struggled to keep up with the rent due to not spending responsibly.

Fae and Max asked me if I could help them financially. I respectfully told them no. (If they had been in debt because something unavoidable drained their savings (like medical expenses) I would have taken from my own savings. But that isn’t what happened here.)

Fae and Max decided to sell one of their cars. Max has to take the bus to work on certain mornings now. But they are now fully caught up with their rent payments and have become more responsible with their spending.

I have a close friend “Jim” with two young daughters. His youngest’s crib used to be in he and his wife’s room, but now she is too old for the crib and will be sharing a room with her sister.

Jim casually mentioned this to me, and that he felt bad, since having two normal beds in that room would be tight. I had a bunk bed that I used to share with a roommate. It’s just been sitting around in storage, so I offered it to Jim for free as long as he helped me move it.

My parents recently moved into a new house and held a small housewarming party. Jim and his wife attended as well, as we’ve been friends for years and consider each other family. During the party, Jim brought his daughters up to me to “Thank auntie OP for giving us your bunk bed.”

Fae happened to be in the dining room as well when that happened. She and Max came up to me after the other guests left and said they were disappointed that I had given the bunk bed to Jim when I could have easily sold it to help them with their rent situation.

Fae and Max acknowledged that I had no technical obligation to help with their rent. But said it was about morals and that since I was choosing to be generous, I should have prioritized actual family over Jim.

My father wanted me to apologize to Fae and Max, since I could have easily gotten two or three hundred for the bunk bed and that would have helped them a lot before they had to sell one of their cars. My mother told me not to, because Fae and Max are responsible for themselves and I was allowed to do something generous for Jim.

I still feel bad, since Fae and Max had to sell one of their cars and relying on the bus is inconvenient. I still don’t think that I should have to apologize for doing a generous thing for a friend. But I know I’m biased. Are Fae, Max, and my father right that actual family should have come before a friend?",nta
"title: AITA For guilt tripping my aunt so I can keep my pet?
content: (edit: I realized after a person commented on this but I did ask her and she did say yes it can stay. I thought I mentioned that but I guess I didn't hope this clears things up)

Hey I'm 19 and I'm living with my aunt for college reasons. About two months ago I found a stray black cat, I wasn't planning on keeping him until my friend reminded me that black cats don't tend to get adopted thanks to superstition and such so I took him in. I ended up naming bean, he has been the light of my life since and had been the only reason I haven't had a mental breakdown. He is a little rowdy and hates window blinds for some reason but all in all he's a pretty chill cat and a massive sweet heart he loves people and other cats. My aunt doesn't like bean though she yells at it everytime it enters her room or lays down in the bathroom or gets on the counters. I've tried to train him and he's gotten better at it but still does it cause he's a cat and they're like that. 

             My aunt has been telling me he needs to just learn or she going to kick it out or make me throw him out. She's been getting more and more insulting to my cat calling him names and blaming him for the spiders in the house saying "" he's bringing them inside to scare me"". I would type what she calls him but let's say I'm to white to repeat most of the insulting names she calls bean. 

             I decided enough is enough last night and planned on guilt tripping her to make her stop. So I told her I'm the morning that I plan on selling him since he's been soooo annoying to her and she wants him gone anyways.

"title: AITA For keeping my promise of training her kids like dogs if/when my cousin dumps them on me?
content: I'm sorry if the title isn't accurate, I can't think of another description to describe the ""training"".

My cousin Amy (25F) has (6M) twins and has a nasty habit of dumping them onto relatives to babysit for the entire day without any warning or regard for their time. I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.

When she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.

The kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.

Soon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.

Two days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.

I shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.

Halfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?

She screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. 

I repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way.

"title: AITA For kissing my friends brother without his consent during a truth or dare?
content: Yesterday I was supposed to spend the night at my friends house with some of my classmates and we were playing truth or dare. There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.

I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?

Please do NOT comment yet, read this:

Ok I don’t know how to explain this without being misunderstood but could you guys do me a small favor? I used a throwaway account for privacy reasons but the thing is, if this post blows up, there is a high chance for my friend to still see this. Could you please instead of commenting, DM me if your judgement is ‘YTA’? I promise if I get a lot of YTA dms I am going to ACCEPT the judgement as per rule 3 but it’s just weird if my friend sees this and sees ‘YTA’ comments especially after our last argument, you guys get what I mean right? Thank you.

EDIT: Oh cmon guys. This post if 1 in rising now. Can't you please do as I asked you? Would you be ok posting on this subreddit just to get comments full of YTA and your friends see them and laugh at you?

EDIT: Hey mods! Please check your inbox as I sent you a message. It's urgent.

EDIT: Ok the mods responded about automod and they basically told me to suck it up and deal with it wth? Guys please just do as I asked you. I accept my judgement",yta
"title: AITA For leaving this appartement and making my roomate pay the rent.
content: Hello.
I moved to an appartement with a roomate which is also a friend. We share it 50-50 and every person is paying half of the rent.
In the contract, we signed that if one of the tenants leave, the other person has to pay the other half of the rent.
I want to leave. My roomate said I can't do this to him, he doesn't have the money to pay the full rent and that I should take responsibility for finding a new tenant and pay rent until I find it. But as I said the contract doesn't say any of that.

"title: AITA For making fun of my friend for dropping out of college?
content: So I (22m) have a friend that we will call Eric (23m) whom I have known since we were little kids. We have always been very good friends and we still hang out regularly. Growing up together, we had a bond that I didn’t have with many other friends. For some backstory, I am Asian and he is white, and when we started getting into our teens he started making a lot of asian jokes and digs at me. In front of all of our friends, in the group chats, basically anywhere he could insert an offensive Asian joke to or about me, he would do it. I never cared too much about it and I always just shake it off. Sometimes it would bother me, but I never acted angry because that would only make him do it more. 

For some more backstory, Eric was never the brightest student. Always skipping class and falling behind in school. It was safe to say he was not very book smart. I have always been an A student, and I will be graduating college with an electrical engineering degree this month. Our freshman year, Eric dropped from his community college within the first semester because he couldn’t handle the work. I never made any mention of this nor did I tease him about it. 

Anyways, a couple days ago, we were hanging out with some friends and having a mild debate about an irrelevant topic which would take too much explaining for how dumb it was. Regardless, Eric, after claiming he was right and I was wrong, says “Damn, I thought you Japs were supposed to be smart.” To which I replied, “Says the guy who couldn’t get through one semester of community college.”

Eric got mad, saying I am way out of line and left. My other friends thought it was funny but Eric hasn’t communicated with any of us since. Was I the asshole here?",nta
"title: AITA For making my roommate cry and not wanting to help
content: I, 22 NB, and my roommate, 21 NB, live in a house together. We've been good friends since freshman year of college and have stayed close through the years of school that we've had together. 

On and off this year we would have arguments that at the beginning of this school year were easily resolved. It wasn't until midway through the year that things started to change.

I noticed that when we argue my friend would become insistent that they were in the right, sometimes interrupting me when I explained my views. As they started to interrupt me more I spoke up about it and how it made me feel, where they told me they wouldn't do it again. 

This is something I've had to ask them to not do over and over.

Today I brought up an issue that was bugging me about them withholding a box of donuts their mother had bought for us to share for my birthday. The day before I told them I was going to take two donuts to eat for breakfast (six donuts in total) as a heads up. They told me I was only allowed one. When asked why, they weren't very clear, but kept repeating that it was an adhd thing. Confused, I simply took one.

Today they let me take two. Bringing up the issue, I reassured my housemate I wasn't going to take more than three donuts from the box and that it was weird/silly that I couldn't take two the day before. Asking why they wouldn't let me take two the day before they snapped at me, cutting me off and calling me an asshole and telling me it was be an adhd thing before telling me they were going to shower.

I went downstairs to cool off. I was confused and hurt by their response. I'd had enough of them cutting me off and not having a civil argument. The arguments we'd been having before had been escalating, sometimes turning into shouting fests or crying fits. I felt that I was on eggshells by trying to understand them.

I was tired of feeling unheard, so if I can't feel comfortable talking to them then I don't want to. They were gone for most of the day after that, hanging with family, doing work, taking time to be alone, etc. I had plenty of alone time. I was able to clean, enjoy a movie, hang out, and play video games. When they got home later in the evening issues arose.

They asked me how my day was, how the cats were, and I'd respond in short remarks. I think they caught on to me being upset because they went to their room. I passed their door earlier and could hear them crying.

Usually in this instance I'd be worried and want to help them, but I feel to exhausted. And, even if it sounds bad, I don't want to help them anymore. So I left it be.

"title: AITA For my reaction when I got home and found my 6 months old daughter wearing the same diaper for 9 hours?
content: 
I 35-F been busy with work (I'm a nurse) and taking care of my 6 months old baby girl and her 6 years old sister. My husband work night shifts-3 nights a week so he's usually sleeping at home during the day. He got himself a ps5 a month ago. He started spending time playing. He used to handle some of the house chorus now all he does is make excuses of how tired he is and how much he needs sleep. But he'd come home from his shift and starts playing. He drinks a lot of coffee to stay concentrated and awake. Also he stopped eating properly. Keeps forgetting to do things I ask him to do. Like help fix his daughter's toys/take turns in changing diapers etc.

I started calling my mom to come help since he's been too busy to do simple things. He didn't like that I asked others for help and said I didn't have to. That he'll start helping again. I actually believed him and left for my 8 hour shift at the hospital and before I left I reminded him of everything he needed to do from feeding/changing diapers/cleaning our daughter's room etc. He said ""don't worry about it"" and then I left.

I called him to check on the kids and he said everything was fine. I came home in the evening and I was shocked to see our 6 months old's bed was put in the living room. Her stuff on the couch. While he was playing. She didn't stop crying he said he didn't know what was wrong. Turned out he didn't change the diaper after I left. She was wearing the same diaper for 9 hours. He said he forgot but he was busy playing. I immediately took care of her. I knew her rash was going to get worse after that. My 6 year old's hair was a mess he didn't brush her hair. The kitchen was a mess. I was livid kept yelling at him for being neglectful and reckless and literally forgetting about his own kids over a game.

He said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for not reminding him on the phone. I told him it was my fault for leaving the kids with someone who doesn't even brush his teeth. He got offended and left the house minutes later.

His mom called me telling me that my husband stayes up at night to make a living for his kids and that I was pressuring him by giving him more than he could handle. I tried to explain but she kept lashing out calling me controlling and said I might be frustrated from my job that's why ""I'm taking it out on him"".

I hung up on her and had to take care of all of that mess.

Sorry for any mistakes I'm just so exhausted.",nta
"title: AITA For my reaction when my 30yo fiancè exchanged his gift with my 16yo brother?.
content: 
I F26 been with my fiancè for 3 years. We both work and we both share rent and other expenses. But My fiancè is currently looking for a new job. He lost his old job 3 months ago. My family lives 30min away and although it's been difficult this year I decided to get my brother (who has a chronic condition and struggled a lot lately and was in the hospital for a few days for anemia) the one thing he's been wanting for some time. I got him an Xbox that cost me 300$. He was so happy and I'm glad I was able to cheer him up during those times.

My fiancè received a few gifts from his family. But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.

We were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fiancè looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got/didn't get this year. That made them uncomfortable especially since they've been dealing with my brother's health issues and needed to relax.

We got home and my fiancè took something from the closet and left for about an hour.

I was asleep when he came back. In the morning I was surprised to find my brother's Xbox in the closet. I woke him and asked him about it. Turned out He dropped me off drove back to my family's house and exchanged the gift his aunt gave him (a 14$ fancy pen) with my brother's xbox. He said that my brother was happy to exchange gifts. I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.
He told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fiancè pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted. He refused so I ended up taking it myself. My fiancè argued when I took it and said that I was pressuring him and treating him poorly and have no respect for his feelings. I told him he was wrong to make my brother give him his gift and causing him stress and ruining his joy. I apologized to my brother and my parents and I felt awful because of how my fiancè behaved. My fiancè isn't talking to me saying that I have no consideration for his feelings and not understanding how he feels not having money to buy himself the things he likes.

I'm surprised because he has never done anything like this before. I get that he's struggling with finding a job but this is not an excuse.",info
"title: AITA For not being happy that my sister is pregnant AGAIN?
content: Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main.

My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.

Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",nta

"title: AITA For not letting my SIL and her family stay with us after they got bed bugs
content: My wife's sister and her family recently got bed bugs while on vacation.  They were on a road trip and picked them up at one of the hotels they stayed at.  They didn't realize it until after they got home.  From what my wife has described about what SIL and her family have had to do to get rid of them, it sounds terrible.  

A week ago, my wife told me that SIL and her husband need to have their whole house fumigated and need to be out of the house for 48 hours.  She said SIL asked if they could come stay with us during that time since they only live 30 minutes away.  My initial reaction was ""no.""  My wife had already told me about the hell that SIL and her family was going through to get rid of the bed bugs, I don't want to risk a single chance that they could bring them into our home.  

My wife said that they had to buy all new clothes and wouldn't bring anything to our house that had any contact with the bed bugs.  She said that the bugs don't live on actual people and since SIL and her family wouldn't be bringing over any clothing or bedding that had bed bugs, we don't have anything to worry about.  She also said that since they picked them up at a hotel, they are obviously wary about spending nights in a hotel during the fumigation.  

I told her that I feel bad for them, but I don't want to take any risk of us ending up in a similar situation.  I don't care if it's even a 1% chance that we get bed bugs too, the things that SIL and her family have had to do to get rid of them sound terrible and to me it's not worth even the slightest risk.  To me, the only way we can be 100% sure we don't get bed bugs is to not have SIL and her family stay with us.

Of course, my wife is not happy about this and thinks I am being unreasonable and that this is the type of thing that family does for each other when they are in need.  I don't have anything against SIL or her family, but to me it's a simple fact of being absolutely sure we aren't exposing our house and family to the same situation that SIL finds her family in.  

My wife ended up telling her SIL that they couldn't stay with us, but now my wife is very upset with me.  She feels like the risk was low enough and that SIL and her family would be careful enough not to bring anything to our house that could bring the bed bugs with them.  But the whole situation that SIL's family is in sounds like something that I would never wish on my worst enemy and the only way we can be completely sure is to keep it far away from us.

I do feel bad for SIL and her family, I'm not heartless.  But my wife feels I should have trusted her and her sister to make sure that nothing would come into our house that would put us at risk.  SIL and her family ended up driving 4 hours to stay with some of her husband's family in a townhome that did not have nearly enough room for them.  

Now my wife feels like if we ever need help with anything, there's no way we can ask SIL because we didn't help them with this.",info
"title: AITA For not letting sister move in?
content: I (30f) and my sister (33f) used to be roommates. We lived together for 4 years, and for it wasn’t a bad experience, which is why we made it work for so long. 2 years ago I finally got my own place and it’s been amazing! I moved 2 blocks from my sister and we pretty much hang out everyday.

Having my own place has been liberating! Stresses that come with roommates were gone. There would be months where she  didn’t have rent money and I had to cover her end. She always paid me back, but it’s frustrating. She has a medical condition that messes with her mobility, so she needs a wheelchair. This requires assistance. Laundry, cooking, driving and cleaning. when we lived together I was basically a live in caregiver covering major expenses.

Since moving, I’m not next door, so she has been better with reaching out to other people to assist. Shes not financailly responsible. She tends to be more impulsive with her spending, spending before rent or payments. She’s always been this way and I have stopped nagging her about it. The problem is this has finally come to a head. Over the years she has been able to receive rental assistance which will usually get her negative balance back to zero. She’s been doing this for YEARS.

Recently she was awarded rental assistance inJanuary and got her rent balance back to $0. she went back to her habits and now she is over $6,000 short on her rent. After the pandemic,the city doesn’t have much more funds. They able to cover one month.

She is unemployed with bad credit.her landlord has sent an eviction notice. She will be homeless. There are friends she can live with, but I know that it won’t be long term. I think my level of patience will be different than what our friends have.

Friends have mentioned that she can move with me but emotionally don’t think I can do it. Since we are so close, it’s frustrating that people look at me to come in and save her. 

I know if I step in 1) this will be expensive. A roommate that can’t pay rent is a lot 2) ill b a caregiver again.I don’t think she realizes how much effort it takes to help her shower,cook, do laundry, and clean up after her, and The gas required for her appointments. 
3) I have to keep in check feeling anger because I work hard to stay afloat and she just spends. I’m living check to check. I makes me mad she can get away with being $6,000 short on rent. My landlord would never allow it.
4) With how broke she is, I know it will not be simple for her to find new housing. Unemployed with bad credit, an eviction on her credit, new housing will take time.

BUT If I don’t step in, she will be homeless. We are adopted, and not close with our family. Our friends are our family, that’s all we got. 
I don’t know what to do.

"title: AITA For not switching places with my friend and ruining her life
content: This happened a couple weeks ago but I'm still getting shit about it.

A friend of mine Daya (fake name) asked me if I wanted to come with her on some errands and see her new car. I said yes because I had some things to get done and my car was being checked over. (We're in the same bubble and stayed masked the whole time)

Well while we were out Daya ended up hitting another car while turning left. We were both shaken but mostly fine yet but when I started to call the police Daya started freaking out even more. She started begging me not to call the cops and to just go talk to the other driver. I didn't feel comfortable not calling them so I went ahead and did. Then Daya started begging me to get in the driver's seat, saying I had to get in the driver's seat, I had to claim I was the one driving. Turns out Daya doesn't have a license. She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.

I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there. Well Daya got arrested for driving without a license, insurance, or registration for her car and just told me today she has been found at fault for the accident.

Now Daya, her mom, and half of our friends are saying I'm an asshole for not just switching places. She is now facing multiple fines, possible jail time, and being kicked out of our MA program because of all this. I tried to explain that I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police but she just keeps calling me a ""privileged bitch"" and wishing horrible things would happen to me.

So am I the asshole for not switching places with her?

Edit: Several people have said I should include this and I'm sorry I didn't in the original post. This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: ""She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled."" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.

Edit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report.",nta
"title: AITA For not wanting to thank my husband
content: I (24F) take care of a majority of the housework. I work from home usually about 4-6 hours a day. My husband (23M) does some things around the house, mostly when I ask. He is gone at work M-F from 7:30-5:30. So it makes more sense that I take on a majority of the house work. I make him breakfast and lunch and cook dinner every single day and He usually thanks me for these things, but I see that as things I don’t actually have to do. I do the  because I want to do it for him, and he is good about thanking me for it. Which is great. There are times that he will do house chores like dishes, vacuuming, etc. but is very sporadic. But I don’t ever thank him for it, it’s just stuff that has to get done around the house. I rarely get thanked for doing things around the house, but I don’t need that because it’s stuff that just has to be done. He’s recently complaining that the reason he doesn’t do things is because I don’t thank him for doing the house chores. I honestly don’t want to thank him because we are supposed to be a team in taking care of the house. 

Last night He ended up doing a lot of stuff like the dishes, vacuuming, resetting the kitchen, brushing the dog, etc. and he made a comment after dinner today about and I jokingly said “thank you” and laughed a bit, not rudely. Then he said that it makes him want to do chores when I thank him, but when I don’t he doesn’t want to do them. And then a heated discussion ensued. I ended up telling him “I’m not going to do anything around the house now unless I hear a thank you and that means I’m not doing [insert super long list of stuff I do]” and he said “fine” but he seriously wants me to thank him after every single chore he does. And I just won’t do it. He’s not “helping” around the house. He owns this house too and it’s also his responsibility to know of the stuff that needs to get done around here. It overwhelms me sometimes that everything is on my plate, and when I have to think about what stuff he can do and then teach him how to do the thing - it’s even more overwhelming. So, AITA for not wanting to thank him for doings his share of work around the house? (Even though it’s only a few tasks that he sometimes does) PSA I love my husband so much, this is just something that is irritating, and I would love to know if I’m in the wrong so that I can make changes within myself.


**Update** thank you all for taking the time to express your opinions/give advice, and especially thank you to those that gave very helpful insight! 

My husband and I talked through this right after I posted this. We both admitted to areas where we can improve regarding this. And YES I will be thanking him more! No it’s not hard to say thank you, but it wasn’t about that, there was more to it! Regardless, I was in the wrong there, I’ll admit that! 

Also, there’s so much context and backstory missing, so please just remember that you never have the full story - but you literally can’t put everything here because it would take years to write and no one’s got the time to do that or read that. 

I have an AMAZING loving husband who is far more mature than me, we are growing together and giving each other grace upon grace. So, Please don’t attack his character. I could bet that he would be the nicest man you’d ever meet in your life! And he would do anything for anybody. 

Also, I wanted to reiterate that we agreed that I would take on a majority of the household duties because I work at home and it make more sense. This was something that I proposed! (Btw he only works 8 hours, but he is gone from 7:30-5:30, I average 4-6ish hours but that means that many days I work 8+clocked hours. But not always!)

"title: AITA For pressing charges when my stepson took something my daughter inherited from her mother?
content: I [M47] been with my wife for 2 years. She has a 21 year old son. I have a 14 year old daughter from my previous marriage. My late wife passed away in 2014. She left a few things for our daughter. Including a gold jewelry set. Her mom was devastated she didn't get to gift the set to our daughter on her wedding day. I keep it in my closet since it's expensive and my daughter is too young to have it. I'll hopefully gift it to her on her wedding.

Last week. We were sitting in the kitchen when my stepson was hesitant to ask me something. We're in good terms but have our fair share of arguments. He said his fiancèe was taking something from his mother's and my closet. saw the jewellery set and liked it very much. He asked if he could borrow it so his fiancèe can wear it at her cousin's wedding. I found this unacceptable I told him his fiancèe had no business being in the bedroom and that the jewellery isn't mine. It's for my daughter. He asked me if my daughter will agree to let him borrow it if he talked to her. I told him not to even talk about it again. He got all pissed and said things I do not remember.

Saturday night. When he and his fiancèe were at the wedding. I discovered that the jewellery set was gone. I told my wife and we looked all over the house. I called my stepson to tell him about calling the police because I really thought someone stole the set. He said there was no need. That he borrowed it and will return it after they get back from the wedding. I yelled at him and told him to come back with it right then. I kept calling him til 12am when he told me to stop calling and that he'd bring it in the morning.

I couldn't sleep that night I felt terrible. In the morning he showed up at 10am. He didn't bring it and started stalling saying: ""he forgot""- ""he'd bring it the next day"". At this point it was clear he gifted it to his fiancèe and was stalling. I got so mad I told him I will be pressing charges if he doesn't return the set today. We got into an argument
My wife said his fiancee was the one who wanted the jewelry set. But he was the one who took it and it's not even mine it's my daughter's which made it worse. Because I'm responsible for whatever happens to it.

His grandparents berated me after I told them this and got mad and defended him when I said that I will be pressing charges. he stole and needed to be responsible for his actions He didn't respond to my final calls so now I've given him one last chance and it's over

I pressed charges today. They're saying calling the police was extreme and cruel. They're all convincing me to back down.

Aita for pressing charges?

He was replying to me sarcastically when I said I'd get the authorities involved and he didn't take me seriously. His mom said she'd try to talk to him but I had enough of him stalling hoping I'll just let it go. So he can make his fiancèe happy.

I feel like an irresponsible idiot. I can't even look at my daughter without feeling frustrated and infuriated. I'm hurt but what's worse is that this is my daughter's property that I couldn't take care of.
My wife allows them into the room although I told her not to several times they're not kids and there should be some boundaries.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",nta
"title: AITA For refusing to listen to my parents and wanting to sue my cousin for a ""prank""?
content: 
I 31M) recently had my cousin M21) move in with me after he got kicked out of his college dorm and had no job to pay for rent. My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets ""family"" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.

I been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.

I saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. 

He realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank ""bro"" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue ""family"" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll ""raise"" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.

EDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is.",nta
"title: AITA For starting an argument about sushi
content: 
I (21F) have been dating my BF(22m) for about 4 months now.  We are both in college and I absolutely love him and we get along great however we’ve recently had our first argument. We once went out to an all you can eat sushi restaurant and ever since than I’ve been talking about how I’ve been wanting to go again. 

About two weeks ago he went out with a group of his friends. I wasn’t upset at all, but I did mention that I missed that place and would like to go again soon before he goes back home after graduation. This week he went again with his friends and even told me he was going. It feels wrong for me to ask to go with him because I feel as though I am just inviting myself, but I did mention I was jealous. 

I’ve been asking some of my other friends to go with me but all of them are busy and he knows this. I have also invited him to go with me a couple times before but he declined as well. 

The next time I saw him I briefly mentioned he owes me sushi because of this and that made him slightly upset. Saying that I can always go by myself. 

I have no idea why he doesn’t want to take me to the sushi place, he has no issues taking me out to other places. 

I explained to him that I’m hurt that because I have mentioned multiple time how much I like that place and wanted to go again. He said he just wanted to hang out with his friends and that he doesn’t always have to bring me everywhere. 

AITA for wanting to get sushi with him?

UPDATE: So I asked him why he never offers to invite/ go with me to the sushi restaurant. His excuse was that last time him and his friends made plans to watch a basketball game at one of their places. I apologized to him for making a big deal out of it, because that is a perfectly reasonable excuse to not invite me. No harm done. But I asked why he won’t make time to go with me and he just told me that he had to be “in the mode for sushi”. Again reasonable, but I explained my side that I’ve been looking forward to going again sometime before he leaves town and it would mean a lot to me if he took the time to take me. He promised that we’ll go soon and if we don’t go before he leaves he’ll take me to the best sushi spot in the city (where he lives)when I visit him.",info
"title: AITA For telling my coworker she wouldn’t have her job if it weren’t for us
content: Context:

This is at a small day spa

I am an esthetician F22

She (Beth) is a front desk woman F40

Estheticians do the treatments and sell product, while front desk handles phone calls and cleaning of the spa along with various other tasks.

Earlier today we were closing down the spa for the day and I was the last one here with two front desk women. Beth has been here for a while and Kate who is in training (F20) has been here about 2 weeks. I went to the back to put my laundry away and over heard Beth telling Kate that “They don’t appreciate it but we do it anyways” as she’s cleaning the table *it’s a pretty small table, about 3 ft diameter*. I interjected and told her she shouldn’t talk about the therapists like that in front of the new girl because it could lead to resentment, which we have dealt with in the past.

I told her that it’s not that we don’t appreciate what they do, it’s just that it’s their job to do the behind the scenes work while our *facialists and masueses* job is to make the money to keep the place open and that without us she wouldn’t have a job here in the first place. 

She got real huffy with me and said okay sorry jeez and walked away, about an hour later I get a text message from my boss saying that I shouldn’t have said what I did and that it was very disrespectful. My thoughts are that it’s just the objective truth. Both of our jobs are hard in their own ways and we shouldn’t act like one job has it easier than the other. I didn’t word it like that earlier because I was just going too fast. I don’t think I should apologize but I may have been too harsh, so Reddit, AITA?

Extra context: My boss is the one who in the past *over 6 mos ago* has said that without us there would be no spa, and that’s why I said it as well.",yta
"title: AITA For telling my fianceé she's either with me or against me in this conflict?
content: So My fianceè (F, 24) & I (M, 27) got engaged in may and are currently planning for our wedeing in Aug. It's worth mentioning that I'm the sole earner  because my fianceé is still in University, I've saved up decent amount of money to afford the wedding.


Thing is her parents get involved in everything. From picking the engagement ring on my behalf, to giving opinions on where we should rent and now my FMIL is constantly giving opinions on our wedding. FMIL would follow up on everything we do and make negative comments on things like: the best man, the guest list, and food.
She told my fianceè she didn't like who I picked to be my best man and wanted me replace him after a big argument but I said no. Though My fianceè said we shouldve just done it.
MIL also wanted me to un-invite people I wanted at the wedding so she could add more guests on her side of family. I said no to that also.

Now the current or biggest conflict between us. MIL called saying she didn't like the venue we picked which is in our hometown. She wanted me to reconsider but I said no since my fianceé liked it too.
But my fianceé came to me yesterday to show me a venue her mom picked and already paid for saying since she paid for it then I should say yes this time. I was in shock and angry because not only did she not consult us but the venue she picked is 3 towns away where my BIL lives. I immediately thought about my disabled parents who can not travel this distance for health reasons, besides that most of my family won't attend because of distance. I said absolutely not agreeing on this venue. My fianceé said she disagreed with me and I had no right to complain because her mom AND dad paid a lot of money for this venue as wedding gift and we should accept it. I calmly explained why I refused and she kept saying I'm refusing on purpose because ""I hate her mom"" and am playing cat & mouse with her. I bluntly said her mom is indeed making this a game and told my fianceé she's either with me or against on this issue. She either backs me up or there won't be anymore wedding planning. She got upset and started crying asking what she's going to tell her mom and why I was making her choose between me & her parents but I just feel like she's refusing to see why I don't want this specific venue. So what of her brother lives there. I have never been to that town so having the wedding just cause her mom paid for the venue is not ok.


We haven't talked eversince that argument. My friend called me ungrateful fool for turning away a free wedding venue over distance but I can't help but feel FMIL did it purposely.",nta
"title: AITA For telling my wife her parents are not allowed to ever watch our son again
content: My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.

I was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  

So we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.

When we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.

I told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.

I told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on.",yta
"title: AITA For telling my wife that if she wants to bedshare she needs to sleep in the kids beds?
content: My wife and I have been together for six years, she has a thirteen year old and a nine year old. When we first got together they were both still in her bed, they were both relatively small and I worked nights. It was never an issue. Last year I suffered a work injury and now have to sleep on a memory foam mattress. 

I assumed by now both kids would of grown out of cosleeping, but obviously havent. I cant comfortably sleep in a bed with two kids, especially because my stepson (nine) is a little ninja. He is constantly kicking during the night.

They will occasionally sleep in their own beds, but very rarely. My stepdaughter is a little better, but stepson will have meltdowns if we try and send him to his own bed. 

My wife doesnt believe we should force them out, which I understand, but I cant keep sleeping on the couch when they're in the bed. 

A couple days ago I blew up over it. My backs killing, I'm tired. 

I essentially told her to take the kids and sleep in one of their beds, I need the comfortable mattress for my back. We never really got to discuss it because stepson got upset and started crying. That night she took the kids to her parents for the night, and back at home she explained that they wouldnt all fit in one of the kids beds. 

She agreed that I could have the big bed, but is ordering a memory foam mattress for our sons bed so I can sleep there comfortably. I dont want to sleep in a kids bed; I want my bed, and I'd like to actually spend a night with my wife. 

Her parents are on her and the kids side, obviously, but I still dont think I should have to give my bed up for them, in the nicest way possible. I paid for it. 

The issue is getting worse, and my in laws are now calling me abusive for trying to take their comforts. 

So, am I the asshole?

Important info; both kids and my wife are asd diagnosed, stepson also has adhd.",nta
"title: AITA For telling my wife to mind her own business
content: My wife (37F) and I (38M) moved to a new neighborhood about 3 years ago with our 2 kids (8 & 6).  Our neighbors across the street have 2 kids (9 & 7) that our kids quickly became friends with. We would hang out with the parents as well and my wife became close friends with the mom.   
 The dad and I got along fine, but never got as close as my wife and the mother. 

Unfortunately, about a year ago, the parents separated and the mom filed for divorce.  Apparently, the dad had an affair.  The mom moved out as the house was owned by the dad before they got married.  She took the kids with her.  According to my wife, the mom tried to get full custody of the kids, but the dad asked for and was granted partial custody.  So he has the kids 3 weekends a month, the rest of the time they stay with their mom.  I've only very briefly talked with the dad about the whole thing as he obviously feels a lot of shame about the affair and we aren't close enough for me to feel I can ask deep questions about it.

The kids all still play together when they can.  I noticed my wife would make it a point to make sure our kids invited them over to our house.  I also noticed that my wife was asking the neighbor kids some pretty odd and honestly rather intrusive questions about their dad.  Like if he has ""friends"" over at his house when they are there.  What he feeds them, what rules he has at home, do they feel safe there, etc.  

This past weekend the kids were at our house and stayed over for dinner and my wife asked the kids if they like hanging out with their dad or mom more.  I cut in before the kids could answer and changed the subject to watching a movie after dinner.  As my wife and I were cleaning up, I asked her what the hell all the questions are about.

She said that her friend is still trying to get full custody of their kids and she asked my wife if she would keep an eye out for anything that she could use to build the case against the dad.  I was shocked.  I told her that's none of our business and she needs to stay out of it.  I told her it seems like her friend is still upset about the affair and is using that anger as justification to try and take the kids away from their father.  

I told her that neither of us has ever seen a single thing to indicate that this guy is a bad father. Sure, he had an affair and that makes him a bad husband, but that has zero influence on his ability to be a good loving father.  I told her what her friend asked to do her was gross and the fact that she's going along with it is something that I strongly disagree with.  I told her she needs to mind her own business.

She said she's just trying to look out for her friend and she's trying to make sure that the kids end up in a situation that is best for them.  I told her that essentially spying on our neighbor is not her responsibility and she's definitely in the wrong for asking the kids the kind of questions she is.  She feels she's completely justified, but I do not.",nta
"title: AITA For testing my MIL that she’s not my actual mother and to stop trying to act like she is?
content: TLDR - my mother in law is a toxic, narcissistic person and was offended when I said she’s not my mother 


My mom passed away many years ago but she was the sweetest person you would ever meet. She was a literal angel and my heart breaks daily that she can’t see how far I’ve come in life since she passed. 

I could spend all day talking about how wonderful of a person my mother was, but at the same time I could spend all day talking about how horrible of a person my mother in law is. 

I have never met someone more narcissistic and selfish in my life. She’s quite wealthy and feels everyone is in her life to do her bidding and everyone should do what she says no matter how wrong she is or you’re a failure in life. 

She feels she can speak to my wife like she’s trash and then send an expensive gift just so she can feel “hurt” that my wife doesn’t bend over backwards to thank her for something we never asked for 

My wife is the oldest of 4 girls and I think her mother took to an extreme liking to me since I’m the first “boy in the family”.…it could also be that she’s alienated her daughters that they all literally moved away from her as soon as they turned 18 and don’t speak to her. 

At first it was whatever. I thought she was nice and all the stories were just her children being a tad over the top…but then the cracks started to show and I saw the dark side of my MIL. 

She calls me and I don’t answer? I get a voicemail of her crying that she needs to talk to me and can’t believe I’m not available 

She sends me a text asking a random question that I forget to respond to within the hour? I get 20 passive aggressive follow up texts about how hurt she is


Now with some back story out of the way, here’s the actual point of this post. She FaceTimed me earlier and was being syrupy sweet for some reason, talking about how excited she was that I “actually had the time to answer” and how much she’s missed me.

After her talking about nothing for about 30 minutes, the conversation finally ended like this-

MIL - I’m sure excited about next weekend!

Me -oh…what’s going on next weekend?

MIL - it’s Mother’s Day!! How could you forget it’s the day to celebrate your favorite mother?

Me - Well. If I’m being honest, My mom’s dead, so I don’t really know when Mother’s Day is

MIL - I can’t believe you would say that. I’m your mother. 

Me - *getting annoyed with the conversation at this point* You’re not my mother. You’re my wife’s mother, but you’re definitely not mine. You need to please stop acting like you raised me when you’ve known me less than 5 years. 

She hung up on me and not even 5 minutes later she starts bombarding me with texts about how much I hurt her and how inconsiderate I am…but I don’t feel bad. At all. 

My wife also thinks it’s hilarious because her mom isn’t used to someone setting boundaries with her and is throwing a hissy fit 


So while I don’t regret saying what I said, I am curious if what I said was out of line or if I should’ve just smiled and agreed with her to keep the peace.

Edit - sorry. I realized I left out a part of my response to her",nta
"title: AITA For treating like sh*t my friend?
content: So I (18m) had a discussion with my “friend” (20m)

I asked him for a favor and he said to me, “I ain’t doing shit for you because you’re a shitty ass friend, you don’t deserve nothing from me” 
And I was really confused so I asked him why he was so upset and he replied 
“Because you yelled at me and treated me like shit a bunch of times and you did this song talking shit about your ex’s (17f) new boyfriend”
(btw in the song I did I added a part saying “I’m sorry to both of you, I just feel confused, I don’t know what I’m saying”)

Yes, I yelled at him, and I apologized to him, but, why I did those things? 

1.he was drunk one time whining about my ex gf(17f) for not being with him instead, I told him to stop being so fucking ridiculous and that was one of the few times I kinda treated him like shit while he was sad at that time

2.he accused me of being the one behind a fake account with my name that was used to text my exes and other girls a bunch of times even tho I proved him I’m not the one behind that account 

3.he convinced my ex(17f) that I’m a cheater because of the fake account and after that he slept with her while we were dating as revenge for being a cheater(which I’m not)

4.he kept number 2 as a secret from me

After everything he did to me I forgave him, but I was different with him, I wasn’t that nice like before all that, I was way more heavy whenever he felt sad telling him stuff like “stop crying over stupid things and be a man” 

I did a lot for him, I forgave him a lot of things, I helped him get back his relationship with his ex, I was there every time he felt sad, even cried for him, etc 

But he says I’m a piece of shit and a bad friend for yelling at him

Personally I think his reasons to hate me are dumb and childish, but what do you think? AITA?",yta
"title: AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before
content: I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.

Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)

To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.

Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.

So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.

Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.

We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.

I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it. So am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA For wanting to keep my bees even though my new neighbor's son is highly allergic to them?
content: I have been keeping bees as a hobby for six years now. I have 4 hives in my suburbian backyard along with a large garden.

My hives are all properly registered and are legal to keep in my town as of right now. 

The problem is that my new neighbors have asked me to get rid of my bees. They purchased the house and moved in over the winter and hadn't noticed my girls until this spring. 

Apparently their son is highly allergic to bee stings. He has been hospitalized more than once and has to carry an epi pen. 

They asked nicely but seemed a little upset when I said I don't think I could do that. They didn't push the issue with me further but I saw a rant on nextdoor that I am sure was written by them.

Some time after that some of the bee hating nextdoor people when to our town board and tried to get bee keeping outlawed in our town. Luckily it didn't pass and they had mentioned in the minutes that current bee keepers would have to be grandfathered in if it did (Because of that I am even more wary of giving it up in case they do bring this legislation up again If I have active hives I can keep them)

My neighbors and I aren't really on speaking terms now. 

AITA For wanting to keep doing my hobby?

EDIT: Thank you for your input everyone

Since many have suggested this - I DO already have security cameras in place. All around my house and pointing directly at the hives. You cannot access the hives without spending significant amount of time on video. The hives are also behind locked fences. 

I just purchased a sign to put on their* gate that says this area is under video surveillance and will be affixing that to their gate ASAP.

*by their I mean the bee's gate!

EDIT 2: 

Sorry to see we couldn't play nice and this thread got locked. Also thanks for the death threats in my DMs LOL

But it looks like the overall consensus is NTA. So thanks for helping to put my mind at rest about this.

Well, After sleeping on it and spending the morning making a few legal calls...

**THE BEES ARE STAYING.**

I just can't take the financial blow on this one. I have spent thousands on my yard. It provides a nice side income and I just can't do it. 

I have all my legal ducks in a row, with my set up, carrying the proper insurance, and following all the state and local laws. I shouldn't have much to worry about legal issues as long as I keep doing it the way I have been. 

I will reach out to my neighbors with an olive branch and some suggestions to keep their kid safe. 

Many people have asked how I would feel if something happened to the kid. And sure, I would feel bad about it. It would be tragic.

Also me bees have *always* been legally permitted and registered.",nta
"title: AITA For “coldly and selfishly taking advantage” of my brother’s housing situation, rather than showing him more kindness?
content: I’m (27F) and my brother Calvin’s (29M) son Aiden is (3M.) Some background information is that, for most of the year, Aiden goes to his mom Lillie’s (31F) every other week. However, Lillie runs a business that largely caters to summer tourists. So between now and the end of August, Aiden only goes to his mom’s house every other weekend since Lillie is working 16-hour days.

Because Aiden was born right before quarantine, our Dad allowed Calvin to move back in with him rent-free, only asking for a little bit of help around the house, so Calvin wouldn’t have to work in-person and possibly risk his or Aiden’s health. Calvin took complete advantage of our Dad’s kindness. He constantly partied, wouldn’t contribute around the house, and lied about why he “needed” Dad to watch Aiden.

Dad has tried reasoning with Calvin for years, but Calvin has just blown him off and Dad’s had enough. He stood up to Calvin and said he is done with Calvin taking advantage of his kindness, and that it isn’t fair to him to be treated as a private daycare for Aiden while Calvin’s out drinking like a frat boy. He gave Calvin four months to figure out actual childcare or work out a new custody arrangement with Lillie and then move out.

We are now two weeks away from the move-out date that our Dad gave Calvin. Calvin was seemingly just hoping for Dad to give up and resume their current living/childcare situation. Calvin is only accepting now that our Dad is serious and isn’t going to back down on this. Our local housing market is awful (think SoCal levels of crazy expensive.) Calvin came to me asking to move in with me.

I made it very clear that if Calvin does move in, he is paying rent on-time with no exceptions. And I am not going to provide childcare for Aiden. Unless it’s an emergency (not “The babysitter cancelled and I “need” to go to this party!”) I am not going to be babysitting him. If he tries to dump Aiden on me, I will report Aiden to CPS as abandoned so that they can contact Lillie to come and pick Aiden up.

Calvin is begging for a discount because he says the rent I am asking (Exactly half of what the mortgage costs me every month) is too high and he would have to get a part-time retail job. Calvin and his high school friends were not very nice to certain people. He’s afraid of someone recognizing him and the possibility of being seen as a cliche person who peaked in high school. I told Calvin I don’t care. Swallow your pride, suck it up, and grow up. I’m already offering a fair rent, and I won’t have him taking advantage of me the way he did with Dad.

Others have called me out and accused me of “coldly and selfishly taking advantage” of Calvin and treating him “like a stranger.” I told these people that if they’re so concerned, they can help house Calvin and provide him with childcare. This got most of them to clam up, but two said that they aren’t Calvin’s sister and that “I’m disappointed in you, Sarah” for being “shrewd” to Calvin instead of showing him more kindness. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA I lied about having a college fund for my step sister to save my sister
content: I am 32F. I grew up with a narcissistic mom. I have never met my dad. The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.

&#x200B;

Things got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.

&#x200B;

When my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.

&#x200B;

I have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed. I know I misled them, but I honestly wanted my sister to be safe.

&#x200B;

AITA for causing my step sister's depression and robbing her of college

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for your reassurance. I showed this post to my sister and the only thing she had to say was ""Duh"". We both have discussed and decided to not contact our step sister. We were never close to her and my friends back there can't safely get any message to her without dragging our mom into it which is the last thing we both want.

All these awards, thank you all again and the kind stranger who gave me gold.",nta
"title: AITA If I tell my ex working a full time job means being entirely responsible for babysitters?
content: Setup: Me (23f) Ex/Father of child(22m) 
Child (2f; no childcare during the summer, school in the fall) 
So let’s dive in. About 2 months ago he lost his job and did nothing but sit at home and play video games until 5 in the morning. Slept until 2 in the afternoon. Barely lifted a finger to pull cat hair out of his own beard. Barely showered. Was a good father, spent time with the child outside of video games daily, made sure she was always fed, changed, bathed, tended too. Personal hygiene, income, and tending the house on the other hand? Horrific. I ended up having to work more to keep up with bills and trips we had wanted to take this summer, and take care of the entire house, yard etc. I’ve noticed these patterns for a long time-He hasn’t touched the lawn mower since we moved in a year ago and we just renewed the lease. (Our first home together- yay) Shit hits the fan. Quite obviously. We aren’t together and haven’t been for about a month now. Living together in civility for the child- we do not sleep in the same room and we strictly only discuss things related to the child. I agree with these terms as does he and it has gone smoothly 89% of the time. He finally gets a new job as a key holder at a corporate chain store, and told me that he has to have his availability totally open, and left it at that. No compromise, no offering his new manager my schedule, no time for me to cut down the hours I’ve picked up recently (within a week time span). I get his schedule Saturday. It conflicts with mine so badly we need a babysitter EVERY day this week. After not needing or having childcare for 2 months. I am now showing up 2 hours late to my 6 hour shift because he works 8-5 today. WIBTA if I told him that it is up to him to find childcare for the time that he has to work after all this? 
Side note: In the 3 years we were  together, he never took a single day off because we didn’t have a babysitter. I have always had to call in late or call out of work. He always blames it on me and says ‘I’m a manager’ also- I am keeping the house, him here or not. -he hasn’t paid bills or utilities in 3 months.
Sorry if this is rambly- really emotional mother going through a lot, thank you for taking the time to read!!",nta

It's just that she doesn't try at all. Yes she helps me move the couches but still why can't she just get a job and we live like a normal person.    .       .                                                         .                                                                Another thing is one day we are riding in the car and at that time I had all the money to pay cost is 450$ put we need 400$ of spending money for me and her each so I didn't give it yet because I was still trying to get the rest but she didn't listen to me fully and told everyone that I was already paid for when there was people who were going to fund me some money and she starts yelling at me about this for 2 days till finally I just sent them 170$ out of the money I was going to use to but more couches.                               .                             she finally sent me over the edge.

"title: AITA and did I overreact for getting annoyed at my husband’s cousin or am I in the right?
content: 
After eloping, my husband and I had a party with his extended family to celebrate our marriage. We had just got back from our honeymoon and I got food poisoning and was still recovering so I was already not in a great mood. 

I wore a nice white dress, heels, washed and styled my hair and did my makeup. I like having my makeup very simple so I put on just a little more than I normally do (including mascara and eyeshadow). I felt pretty and confident with how I was presenting myself. 

When my husband’s cousin got to the event we greeted and hugged her and then the first thing she said to me was “oh, you could have told me and I would have done your hair and makeup for you” and also by the face she made it seemed as though she thought I didn’t put any effort in. She does her makeup very heavy. I think she looks beautiful with it but it’s personally just not for me and I know I wouldn’t feel comfortable or myself with her style of makeup so I just said “oh thank you but it’s okay, I like doing my makeup very simple”. So that was the first thing that made me feel uncomfortable because I was thinking “why? What’s wrong with how I look?” And I just thought that she could have avoided saying that. I don’t think it was the right time or place. 

We were still waiting for a lot more people to show up and she kept talking to my husband in their mother tongue which I am still learning, while I was just standing there listening to their conversation. I felt really excluded and super awkward. Sort of like a little kid waiting for their parent to finish conversing with a friend. 

To top things off, since I was not feeling well I didn’t drink, so when it came to her and my husband taking a shot together she handed me her phone and said “here, can you take a video of us since you’re not drinking?” Even though her sister was right next to her. I stupidly obliged, but I definitely felt my cheeks go red from the frustration. 

When I brought it up to my husband and sister in law they said I was exaggerating but my mom and grandma agree with me. What do you think? AITA?",nah
"title: AITA argument with partner
content: I'll try and explain it to the best of my ability and memory. 

My partner(ex partner) picked me up Saturday, just gone, and said she was anxious. So I offered to drive instead. They said no they're fine.

As we're navigating a busy roundabout, they had closed a lane. Meaning we were now I'm the wrong lane. When trying to move across lanes no.one was letting her in and cars started beeping. I said, don't worry, just relax take your time. Don't let the beeping rush you.jist focus. Words of encouragement or so I thought. Once we got further round we managed to get Into the correct lane. Then she started to tell me to stfu a few times to me(Which i did). Then she also said I told her to f**king relax and I said I didn't say that did I and she said no it's the basically the same. I said oh okay, I thought I was being helpful and encouraging. 

Then we got to another roundabout, and she said where now, and I said 3rd exit, and she said, ""Where is that?"" I said 1,2, and 3 pointing to the exits. Then she started berating me, calling me an arsehole and saying I don't care, etc. 

This happened for a good couple of minutes of me just talking it, and then it started up again. we argued and said, ""Let's go home."" Then she said I'm sick of you, and you're all shit.""

Then I started shouting, not insults but frustration. Basically, saying whatever I do, it isn't enough, if I say something or if I don't. 

Then she dropped me home after a discussion in the car and me not wanting to leave the car straight away because I wanted to try and talk it through. As she always flees an argument. 

It's been 3 days, and I have no idea what's going on with my relationship. We were soon to be married, which I postponed for a reason I won't go into here. We were trying to work on things.

The last message I got was this(Not talking to you is extremely difficult. Like I can't do it. You scared me. It was abusive.)

I've tried to ask what's going on, but there is nothing slient treatment.

"title: AITA because I called the department of labor on my old job while my friend still works there?
content: So I worked at a restaurant where I met my friend Ron. I was a server/food runner/ expo, he still works there as a chef. 

This restaurant pools tips and tips out everyone including the dishwashers and cooks, which in the state the restaurant is in, isn't legal. To top it off the two managers were taking the majority of the tips and then tipping everyone out, servers and runners with a percentage to get them up to the state minimum wage and then $20-$50 for kitchen workers depending on their job. 

I left the job after Ron told me that the two managers take the majority of tips for themselves. After I left I called the DOL and reported them, because, of course I want my full wages that they took from me, and the DOL took up the case and have been carrying out investigations. 

Ron and I used to talk every day, and up until last week I hadn't heard from him much for a month. We talked for a little bit and then he told me about how the DOL was conducting interviews there all week and it ""seriously interrupted his life"" and I was an asshole for calling the DOL because he might have to payback all of the tips he's been accepting. He told me that I needed to apologize and i scoffed at that and he kept pushing it and I finally ""apologized"" with ""I'm sorry that you work for scumbags"" and followed up with ""I'm sorry that you might have to payback money you were happily accepting in an illegal scheme"" and hung up the phone. He sent me a text calling me a douchebag and said ""I always knew you weren't a real one""

"title: AITA because I(18m) called my girlfriend(18f) fat or can she just not take a joke back?
content: On Friday after my workout I was on FaceTime with my girlfriend. After my shower I was brushing my teeth and other hygiene stuff. Out of nowhere she says something like “put some clothes on you still look tiny” and I said if I’m skinny then she is fat. We are both pretty much the opposite of those things so obviously they were jokes. Even though both jokes were ass I at least gave her a little ahhaha before I said what I said. What do I get for my joke??? Called childish and Blocked. Literally until a couple hours ago I was blocked the whole weekend.

So now today we were on our way to our first period class and she was ignoring me and wouldn’t talk to me in the hallway. When we got in the classroom she goes and tells the teacher that I’m harassing her. The teacher sends me to the office and she literal smirks at me on my way out while the teacher is calling the office so I know she was being petty.

I’m in the office and the principal and counselor are giving me this pointless ass lecture trying to make it seem like I was creeping on her or something. Anyway I had in school suspension(ISS) and detention after school for today. 

She unblocked me and said if I had apologized she wouldn’t be mad anymore and it wasn’t actually what I said it was how I said it. I left her on read because I had no idea wtf she was talking abt at the end that doesn’t even make sense and I will admit that I was kinda in my feelings about the whole harassing thing. Anyway, I came here because when I was telling my boys I got nothing but horrible takes and the advice was even worse. It was so bad that I literally left the gc. 

Btw I’m about to go to her house in about less than 2 hours. So we may or may not talk in person tonight.",nta
"title: AITA flipping out on my fiance for cancelling all the vegan food options from our wedding food menu behind my back?
content: 

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads & appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

"title: AITA for ""Spoiling"" a Videogame for my boyfriend?
content: AITA for ""Spoiling"" a Videogame for my Boyfriend

My boyfriend (18M) and myself (18F) play a game. (I'll ommit the name of the game to avoid potentially spoiling anything)

It's not multiplayer so we're forced to play alone. The game is chat based and the player is tasked with being a barista at a coffee shop while characters come in and out throughout the days chatting about their lives and progressing the story. He and I both started the second game and I assumed we were on the same day but it turns out I was one day ahead of him. (meaning different characters were at the coffee shop for me)

I mentioned the name of one of the characters( let's call them Ben)  that were in the previous game while playing and he asked me who I was talking about. So I answered and he still didn't know who I was referring to. So I recapped Ben's story arc from the last game which also involved another character and he realized who I was speaking of. I should also mention we were having this conversation over the phone on call.

After that, I started playing the game again and ""brewing"" drinks while saying things like ""milk, tea, cinnamon, why isn't this working!"" Etc. And my boyfriend said ""that's it! I'm deafening!"" (Deafening, means that his mic will be muted so he can't hear me and my audio won't relay to him either) I thought he was joking but I ended up talking to myself for a bit :/

I messaged him and asked him to undeafen and he said he wouldn't because he didn't want me to ""spoil anything else"". Which I found odd so I asked what exactly I spoiled and he told me that I told him that characters from the previous game were in the second one. But those characters were already in the first game and HE ASKED ME to tell him who I was talking about. 

I personally get pretty intense when it comes to spoilers and I don't condone spoiling media for others which is why I never do it however I don't think I spoiled anything for him. I told him nothing about the dialogue or the plot. And this game isn't the kind where a character appearing in the second game would be some huge plot twist. All I did was answer his question and recap the last games events for him. So I don't consider what I did a spoiler.

Not to mention before I started playing the second game, he told me that a character from the first game wouldn't be in the second game much. And I told him this to explain how similar both our comments were but his excuse was ""the game developers already realeased that information themselves"". Personally I never knew anything about that and I didn't consider what he did a spoiler at the time so I don't understand why he considers my actions to be spoiling the game for him.

He's mad at me now and says that he doesn't understand why I won't apologize for spoiling the game when I ""clearly did"". I think this is a contradiction in beliefs of on what it means to ""spoil"" something. Please don't hate on him or myself in the comments and keep everything respectful.",nta
"title: AITA for ""announcing"" that my dad's not paying my college tuition
content: My aunt and uncle are paying for my cousins college.  

My dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff. Which would be fine if you have a normal dad. Mine isn't.  

My dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked ""missing"" because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides ""to make sure I'm not hiding anything "". 

I decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay. Which I could totally see him doing.  I'd rather be in debt than controlled for 4 more years.  

I just finished my first year. 

Well my family got together on the 4th and... well sometimes they're nosey.   They were talking about my cousins school and my uncle looked at my dad and said ""well how much is - my name- school costing you?"" 

I said ""what are you asking him for I'm the one paying for it?"" 

Later on my dad was pissed off and said that it was out of line to say that and I embarrassed him. 


I didn't do it to embarrass him, I was just being honest.  He doesn't even know how much tuition is so he was the wrong person to ask.

"title: AITA for ""forcing my daughter to waste food""
content: This is stupid but the daughter in question told me to post here to prove her right. So I guess we'll see who's side internet strangers are on. I'll keep this short. 

My family had steak tonight for dinner. There was a large piece of pure fat on one of the steaks which I cut off to throw away. My daughter (16) told me not to throw it out and that she wanted to eat it.

I cut her off a small slice from the fat and gave it to her, but she insisted I give her the whole thing. It was a huge piece of fat, which would be super unhealthy to eat. I told her no, she didn't need a slice of fat half the size of her entire steak, and said that would be ridiculous. She got upset that I ""forced her to waste food she wanted."" 

I see part of my responsibility as a parent to keep my children at least relatively healthy and not feed them pure beef fat just cause they want it. 

AITA for throwing it away?

"title: AITA for ""forcing"" my father to pay child support
content: My father is a dick. When he got my mother pregnant he wanted her to quit her job and just stay home to ""be a good little wife and mother.  He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  

So the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). 
His family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. 

When they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.

So long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  

He is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  

He has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  

I don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  

But I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. 

I'm not giving it back. 

AITA?

Edit: to answer some common questions. 

1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. 

2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. 

3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. 

4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.

5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.

Edit número dos.

I just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her ""friend"" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.

Edit tres

My half brother has posted about this. He has a slightly different viewpoint than myself.  He is not in any way coming after myself or my mother. If you comment there keep in mind he is a young man who is disillusioned with his father.",nta
"title: AITA for ""hacking"" my moms instagram to see if she violated NDA?
content: I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.

Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.

My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""

My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""

Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.

My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.

I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.

It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is. So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for ""imposing my culture"" even though I thought I was just being nice?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though I (23f) am American, my parents are immigrants and therefore I have a different cultural upbringing than most. One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.

My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.

I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were ""a charity case"". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.

After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?

quick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house. I did post a brief update and faq in my most recent comment.",nta
"title: AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single?
content: This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. 

He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. 

Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. 

Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. 

Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol

Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband

Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important

Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. 

Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single

Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. 

AITA reddit?

Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.

Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" 

He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.""",nta
"title: AITA for ""shaming"" my partner for how much they earn?
content: Sorry for the clickbaity title but that is verbatim what my partner said and the main reason of our conflict. The pronouns are mentioned to avoid misgendering!

So, slight background I (she/her) work in a field where I have to travel a lot. I am gone for weeks at a time. So I'm home maybe 50-60% of the time. My partner (they/she) on the other hand, works for a charity in our area (full time job - not a volunteer). Because i work in a corporate and them in a charity, the difference in our pay is extremely apparent but it has never caused problems before.

The one thing i don't like about my partner is that they are sloppy (dishes piling, clothes lying around, furniture remaining undusted etc.) I am not clean freak by any standards but i do like some organisation in my home and surroundings. 

Now to the main conflict - I was gone for 2 weeks and when i returned late last night, all i see around the apartment are clothes strewn and takeout boxes piling on the garbage can. When i grabbed a glass of water, i had to drink it out of a cup because the glasses were used up and in the sink. I was tired and just went to bed like that and by the time i woke up my partner was gone for their work.

I spent my day off cleaning up the apartment and when my partner came home, i decided to confront them. I told them that coming home to a sight like yesterday was becoming more and more common and i hate using my day offs trying to get some semblance of cleanliness around me. This somehow turned into an argument. At one point i said ""You are home a lot more than i am so it makes sense that you do more cleaning up than I do"" and my partner said, ""I'm sorry, do i look like your housekeeper? just because you earn so much more does not mean i don't have work to do. Stop shaming me for earning less than you.""

At this point i am utterly baffled because wtf!? I am just so confused about this whole thing and i am currently on the sofa because apparently i don't deserve the bedroom... I still think what i said was not incorrect but my partner was really mad at me. So people of AITA, AITA for shaming my partner? I really don't think i was doing that (100% not my intention) but i need an outsider perspective. Because if i am, i have to plan a massive apology for tomorrow.",nta
"title: AITA for ""showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son?"" UPDATE
content: Hello all. Hope all is well. Let's get down to it.

So my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.

Some questions to be addressed.

1. Why would I just not pay for everything?

I am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)

2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.

True. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.

3. You gave them their college fund to waste.

No. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.

3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?

He has a better start than the majority of people.

So, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior

1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.

2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.

3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)

4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.

I layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, ""I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well."" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)

Anyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.

TLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.",nta
"title: AITA for 'going off' on a mother in the toy store
content: I'm (28M) my brothers care taker (21M mental age 7-8), our parents decided at 18 to tell us to screw off, so when my brother (let's call him Bill) turned 18 I grabbed him and enrolled him to get his GED since he didn't finish highschool, and take care of him. His chores are too clean his room,  help with laundry and set the table for supper. I get paid by the state and you better believe I make sure his needs are met. He's my little bud. 

At the end of the month for each day he does his chores he gets a sticker, at the end of the month that sticker gets counted as 5$ and he uses the money for whatever he wants.  Like toys, special snacks etc. He loves this. 

He's been so good lately with chores I took him out for burgers and fries and took him to the toy store. My brother is big.  Not fat, just tall and actually big boned (he's healthy weight and overall health), he gets excited and stims by flapping his hands, you do you little dude. 

At the toystore he announced he wants Barbie's,  cool,  no judgement,  and we go look at barbies. He's stimming and rambling about what he wanted and meanwhile a lady and little girl come in the aisle. Not even two minutes pass and the lady tells us to go to another aisle, she wants to look at the dolls and his weird hand movements are freaking her out.  I tell her to wait her turn. 

Not even another minute passes and she tells my brother to knock it off and go look at something else. Now I'm pissed. I tell my brother to get what he wants and looked at her and told her, her daughter could use a better role model, I'd hate for her to turn into such a grouchy hag. Took my brother out to pay for his barbies all while ignoring her telling me how much of an asshole I am for saying that in front of her daughter.

"title: AITA for Arguing With My Mom
content: My mom (f57) and I (f14) recently just got in an argument. It was honestly the dumbest thing she began and argument over but whatever. I had just bathed my younger sister (f3) and was bringing her downstairs. When I got to the bottom I put my hand on the wall and had been holding my phone with the same hand while she made it down too. My middle finger was on the opposite wall making it seem as if I was flipping someone off. My brother initiated it that way and told my mom I flipped him off. She called me in the living room and ignored me until after I put a diaper on my sister. 
        She proceeded to yell at me and said that I lie so I was probably lying about not flipping him off. I said “I wasn’t flipping him off, but Of course you would believe him”. It came off ruder than I had wanted it. Minutes later she told me not to have an attitude. I simply replied “Telling you I am not lying is not having an attitude”. My mother began yelling and lecturing me on how inappropriate that was of me to say. 
         She said that the things my therapist tell me have been helping her to change too. She then called me selfish and began going on about how I have not once even tried to change. She said I had no respect and that I should respect her. I honestly began crying and then told her that “respect isn’t just given you have to earn it and if I have to respect you, you should respect me in the slightest. You told me that”. I once again said it in a rude manner without meaning to come off as rude.
          My mom told me I wouldn’t be allowed to see my sister or go to her house because I act like ‘this’ when I come back. She then told me that she doesn’t like me and I only love myself and how I hated everyone. And the only reply I seemed to come up with right before I exited the room was “including myself”. AITA?

Edit: I have been laying in bed thinking about everything while reading your comments. My mom just opened my door minutes ago and peeked in then went to her room and all I hear from the other side of the door is her on the phone with my dad talking about sending me to stay with him for the summer. P.S. he doesn’t pay much attention to us.",nta
"title: AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?
content: I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.

We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.

On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.

I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.

I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.

After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.

Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.

I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.

Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.

AITA?

**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.

**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.

**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",info

"title: AITA for Making a Bet with my Daughters Coach Against another Player?
content: So my(44M) 14YO daughter has been playing volleyball for 3 years. She is on a National team at a pretty good club. She typically plays setter but since last club season and grew from 5’10 to 6’1,Her coach took one look at her and decided she was too tall to do anything but hit so she plays right side.

There are 2 setters on the team. I’ll call one of them Emily. Emily’s mother is childhood best friends with the coach. And despite having played her entire life, she’s not very good. Out of everything she does I’d say the best probably is setting but many other girls on the team set better than her. Not only that but she is extremely cocky. Also, her mom is insufferable. She constantly corrects other people’s kids and says she knows everything about the rules since her daughter has played the longest. 

Well about a month ago we had a big qualifier for nationals and our other setter couldn’t make it. On the first day, Emily was doing awful. She was messing up every single play. Not setting the ball unless the pass was perfect, getting so many doubles and dumping it straight into the net. Her mom kept sideline coaching everyone but her kid. And said many times “I know Emily’s not having a good day but one player can’t mess up the whole game.” But if it’s a setter, yes they can.

Then the coach yelled at my daughters best friend for taking second ball when Emily didn’t even go for it and then subbed her out. This made me so mad. After losing 2 consecutive matches to teams that were nowhere near our level,Emily said to everyone in the huddle that she’s having a bad day so everyone has to play up for her and we’re only losing because no one is hitting her sets.

Me and 3 other parents decided to talk to the coach. We said that if Emily said herself she was having a bad day, maybe she shouldn’t play anymore. She said being a setter takes experience and our girls don’t have that. I made a deal with her that if my Daughter could set one match and won in 2 sets, she could set the rest the rest of the tournament.

Well, not only did my daughter win in 2(to a really good team) but she had a recruiter approach her and tell her to consider their college. The coach tried to say that she said my daughter could set the rest of the day not the tournament, but we all called her out.

Emilys mom was furious and said we were bullying a child and it was not okay. Her daughter still got to play DS but she was not okay with only getting 3 rotations so she left on the second day, we ended up going undefeated the second and third day and qualified for nationals. I do feel bad though, because Emily is only a kid. But I just feel that at a National level, this should be more about winning than sparing one kids feelings. Especially since the other girls are all held to much stricter standards. I feel like we could’ve been nicer, but on the other hand, I think that was the only way to get the coach to listen to us. So AITA here?

Edit: my daughter plays up an age level, this is a 16U team.",nta

She took time off from working during my childhood to care for my sister (who has two severe disorders). Due to this she will be excused for not working during the time she cared for my sister. 

Today she has been hassling me to give her my social insurance number. She is convinced having my information on there will get her more money. I live on the opposite side of the country and would have to give it to her over phone or email/ text - which I am not comfortable with. I told her I would enter it into the form when she visits next month. She told me she needs it right away or she won’t get a payment this month. I told her to give me her login information and I will enter it myself. She responded with, “but then I will have to give you my personal information!” And I told her she had to take the risk, not me, if she was screwed over by her own poor planning. 

She is pretty angry at me now. My husband on the other hand is glad I stood up for myself and refused to surrender my SIN. But I am still wondering, AITA?

"title: AITA for Texting my potential future Landlord at 11:30PM?
content: I texted this guy who owns the place I'm planning on living at in a few months last night (@11:30PM) after I got off work because I was A:Working & B:Waiting for a confirmation from existing residents that I was green-lighted from them to apply. I was tired so when I got home I immediately crashed & went to sleep without checking my phone.

""Hi X, this is XXX, a friend of XXX & XXX who's planning on moving into XXX in July. I just got a confirmation from XXX that they're committed to moving so I'm just starting a conversation with you here about getting set up to move in a few months.""

When I wake up, I see that not only did I get the guy's name wrong (called him by his last name only, didn't see the first name listed), but he complained about being texted at 11:30 & then at 1:45AM he texted that I should look for somewhere else to live & that he won't be accepting my application.

"title: AITA for abandoning a grieving friend after she tried to charge me rent?
content: My friend is a recent widow. It's been a long time coming but that hardly makes it easier, her husband passed away at the end of February and she has been understandably distraught since. I have tried my best to support her through this even though I can't possibly understand what she's going through. At the beginning of the March she asked me if I'd stay over during the night because she couldn't stand sleeping alone in an empty house. I obliged and temporarily moved in once I was sure my husband was okay with it. She's not been taking care of herself so I have been doing 100% of the household chores and taking care of her and all her responsibilities as well as working full time. Well last week she spring on me how much she'll be expecting in rent from here on out. She heavily implied I was taking advantage of her in her grief trying to live in her house for free and that she expects me to backpay her rent for the two months I'd already been there. I was extremely insulted by this and told her I'd transfer her the money she wanted but I would be moving back to my own house (where I am also paying rent). I got my stuff and was out within a couple of hours. She has since asked me to come back but I have refused, I told her I'd still do her shopping and I'll come over to help her with a few bits but I'm not spending another night in that house.

"title: AITA for abandoning my friends at the cinema after they were almost 40 minutes late?
content: So this actually happened a couple of months back and I thought we were fine now but apparently not. 

So I (30f) and my friends 'Amy' (31f) and 'Sam' (31f) had made plans to go to the cinema one Sunday evening. The showing was at 6.10pm so we'd planned on meeting at 5pm at one of the restaurants there for a quick dinner. 

My friends live near eachother in the suburbs so Sam drove them and I walked as I live in the city. When I arrived I saw a message from Amy saying they were running 10 minutes late. I text her saying that's fine, to keep me posted and then I sit on one of the benches nearby and text her a pic of my view so she knows exactly where to find me (there's a line of benches spanning most of one side of the cinema) and play about on my phone. 

At around 5.15pm I text her again asking if they have a restaurant preference and I'll go get us a table. 5 minutes later I try calling her and 5 minutes after that I try Sam. I knew Sam was driving but figured it would prompt Amy to either answer Sam's phone or look at her own. At 5.30pm on the dot (I was clock watching by this point) I throw in the towel and head downstairs to the exit. The weather has turned so I walk to the bus stop which is on the other side of the road and as luck would have it my bus is just turning the corner as I arrive so I jump on. 

I'd gone passed at least 3 stops by the time Amy calls me. To her credit she's immediately apologetic then tells me her phone was on silent in her bag in the back seat. She asks where I am and I tell her straight that I'm on the bus, that I'd waited as long as I could. She tells me to get off and I laugh. I say no, it's too late now, I'm starving and I'm just gonna pick up some food on my way home. I honestly wasn't furious or anything but even if I had gotten off when she called it's a 10/15 walk back to the building. It would have been too late for food at that point. She tells me she'd already purchased my ticket and I say I'm sorry but they were over half an hour late without contact and I just couldn't wait around for them anymore. I didn't offer to reimburse her. 

The following day they both text me to apologise, I accept and think nothing more about it until this weekend where Amy brought it up when we were out with friends, 'joking' about me owing her a cinema date in a somewhat passive aggressive tone. She also blatantly denies it was nearly 40 minutes, claiming that I was being dramatic and it was 20 at most. It escalates and she basically tells me I'm being a bit of a dick for not even offering to pay for my ticket. Our friends are pretty evenly divided.

I appreciate this is super low stakes but I'm genuinely curious if I'm in the wrong here? I'll absolutely take her out to the cinema if I'm deemed the asshole.

ETA: a few questions that are coming up in the comments/stuff I cut for character limit;

1. Yes, there are call logs and this did come up on Sunday when we discussed it. Regardless, she attempted to claim that it couldn't have really been 30 minutes before I left since she called me at 5.38pm and I was already on the bus. I explained like I did in the post that the bus just happened to arrive as I got there so from bench to bus seat would have been around 3/4 minutes. There's not much traffic here on a Sunday so it was already some distance by the time she called. 

2. I didn't want to eat in a restaurant by myself. It was 40 minutes before the film when I gave up and around 30 minutes before Amy got in touch. I doubt we could have ordered and eaten before the start time.

3. I could have popped into Starbucks or Gregg's (if they were still open) for a sandwich and would have probably done so had they kept me updated but I had no idea what was happening since they hadn't been in touch in over half an hour. 

4. Cinema just serves nachos, popcorn, ice cream etc. No dinner options. 

5. I didn't know Amy had bought the tickets already. That wasn't something we had discussed. 

6. Amy text me at 4.49pm to say they were running 10 minutes behind. It's a 30 minute drive from her house. I suspect she sent that before she got in Sam's car and instinctively chucked her bag in the back seat (seems weird to put the bag in the backseat once you're already in the front) and was just hoping they'd get there super quickly. 

I think that's it, feel free to ask anything else.",nta
"title: AITA for accepting my mums wedding dress
content: I (23mtf) recently got engaged to my fiancé (25m). We plan on having a small wedding to keep costs down so we can save more for the honeymoon and for what comes after. To save cost and mostly sentimental reasons my mum passed her wedding dress she got married in to my step dad to me (i say step dad but i just call him dad and has been my dad since i was 6).

My mum gave me a few resons for giving it to me instead of my sisters (23f and 21f). 1. 23f doesnt know if she wants to get married or have kids and 21f is admant about never getting married and having kids. 2. Ive shown intrest in it before. 3. I want kids in the future. 4. Im mums size and the dress will only need a few ajustments and 5. Im her eldest. Some of those reasons might be shallow but i think the majority are good reasons as to why.

The problem is 21f is upset that ive been given the dress and not her as the ""eldest daughter"" from our mum as she said. This is causing quite a rift with some of the family. Mum, dad and sister 23f are on my side but its causing a lot of drama with other family members and its just tireing. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?
content: My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. 

I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.

My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. 

This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. 

I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”",nta
"title: AITA for admitting I regret having children.
content: My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). 

Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". 

I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. 

My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.

Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. 

It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. 
 
AITA for saying it though?

Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. 

When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. 

Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  

Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. 

My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.

Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",nta
"title: AITA for allowing my friend to have a cringy yearbook quote
content: Me and my best friend R graduate this year. We have been friends for 4 years so we decided we were going to have matching yearbook quotes. It took us a while, but we settled on quotes from one of our favorite shows. 

A few months passed and he told me (completely out of the blue) that he was going to change his yearbook quote to something else. At first I didn’t really mind since, so I asked what he wanted to change it to and he responded with “I’m not sure yet.” I started naming our other choices and he told me that it wouldn’t be a shared quote. I asked him why and he told me it was because he didn’t want to be that cringey kid who had a shared quote with someone he would probably never speak to again. I was pissed off and a little hurt but let it be since I really didn’t want any drama. 

About two weeks ago, R told me his new yearbook quote and it was truly the cringiest quote I had seen. I’m not going to share it in case any of our other friends pr family members see this, but it was pretty much just him being a pick me about his crush. I didn’t have a big reaction to it because it was his own choice and I didn’t want it to seem like I was jealous of not sharing quotes anymore (he has a history of saying that type of stuff when these kind of situations happen).

Our friend group shows affection by borderline bullying each other, but we also use it to “correct” each other about behavior or things like smelling bad, etc. It’s pretty obvious whenever one thing happens or the other. 

We received an online copy of the yearbook last night and since then, he has pretty much been made fun of the entire time. Besides that, his crush also texted him that it was weird and he really needed to let her go (she knows about his crush on her but she’s taken). 

He texted me this morning telling me I should have never let him put that quote there and instead provided him with a different idea. I told him that since he was so focussed on not being a cringey kid, he should have known this would happen. He then told me I’m a shitty friend and caused him to have panic attacks because of this. After that he blocked me. I haven’t reached out to him because I’m too stressed for the finals to do this, but I’ve had all day to think about it and the doubt is kicking in. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?
content: I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",info
"title: AITA for announcing my pregnancy ""right before"" my brother's wedding?
content: I guess my big question is: how close to a wedding is too close to make a baby announcement?

I (24F) am *finally* 12 weeks pregnant! It has been 12 weeks of excitement, and nausea, and impatiently waiting to tell my parents. My husband and I are ecstatic, we've been trying to get pregnant for almost a year and it was starting to feel like it wouldn't happen. We had a pregnancy loss in the past, so we decided to wait the whole 12 weeks to announce.

The day came, all check ups were good, and I could tell my mum. It was great, she cried, I cried, we all cried. I felt absolutely blissful (and mostly still do). After my parents, his parents, both sets of grandparents etc.  I called my brother (33M), he was really happy for us, really happy that his kids would get cousins, we talked on the phone for an hour. We joked about the fact I wouldn't be able to drink at his upcoming wedding which is three weeks away.

This is where I might of fucked up? The day after, I posted it to Facebook. We visited or called anyone who we wanted to tell personally and Facebook was an after-thought.

The next day my mum calls me really upset, apparently my brother had called her and had ranted about the fact that we announced the pregnancy 'right before' his wedding. That their whole wedding would now be about me being pregnant, and I would steal the attention from his fiance. He was specifically pissed that I put it on Facebook.

It's been a couple of days and apparently he's still pissed. I tried calling him and he wouldn't answer me. Should I just let it go and see if he calms down? Maybe my mum shouldn't have repeated what he said since he was just venting; but he upset her quite a lot, she's not the appropriate person to vent to in this situation.

Mostly, is three weeks an appropriate time away from the wedding? And the Facebook thing? We don't have a huge overlap in our Facebook friends, I already talked to most of the family who would be attending his wedding anyway.

Should I apologise?

"title: AITA for arguing with my mother for “bossing” me around?
content: This post is about me yelling at my mother for constantly “bossing” me around. That is the ACTION. Writing this because my post kept getting removed for rule 7.

My (21M) parents (60M and 56F), SIL (30F) and I were picking up brother (29M) from the airport.
When my brother exited the airport, my mother immediately ""ordered"" me to help brother with his luggage.
I do not have an issue with helping him, but I just do not appreciate that fact that my mother always treats me like a child and thinks she can just order me around, so I tell her exactly that. She does this quite often. 

When I ask her why she did not help me with my luggage when she picked me up, she says
""I'm your mother. You should be helping me, not the other way around."" She also said that she did not appreciate being ""bossed"" around by her in-laws before, I feel like she does the same to me. 

I tell her that she was disrespectful and told her she cannot just “order"" me and then reminded her how she felt when she experienced the same treatment from her in-laws. She got offended and blamed me for refusing to help my family.  I still did help my brother with his luggage because my quarrel is not with him; I just didn't take too kindly to disrespect.

My mother then says that she thinks that I'm acting this way because it's my birthday which causes me to feel ""invincible.""

This develops into an argument about me not willing to help out my family and how I'm selfish even though I was only telling her to pay more respect to me.

The action to be judged is getting into an argument with my mother. I might be the AH because my family keeps telling me I should have respected my mother even though I was only telling her how I felt.

My family thinks I'm the TA, but I feel that I was justified for getting into an argument with her. AITA?

UPDATE: I later spoke to my brother and SIL, and they now agree with me as they also believe that my mother is normally like this.",info
"title: AITA for ask/want a mother's day even when he warned me that he does not celebrate anything and I had accepted it?
content: I will try to make this story short. Please forgive me for my bad english, I'm  still learning. 

My husband celebrates absolutely nothing for ""religious"" reasons while I celebrate everything. We are been together for 6 years and never bother me that much and never push him to do it. 

When we got married I already knew this and I accepted it, I continue to celebrate my things and he is free to decide if he wants to join or not. 

 This is where the problem lies, this Sunday will be my first mother's day after a very hard year and I want him to celebrate me.

I didn't know how much it would affect me if he do nothing and I want him to celebrate something for me for this time only, to put an effort into surprising me (never has).  I don't ask for anything extravagant, breakfast in bed or flowers or that he take care of the baby for the day and I can relax for a few hours. 

We live in his country, I give up my job to stay at home with our baby and work in his business because is for the best for our family even when I dont like to work on that. I only have my sister here for a while and 2 friend but still doesn't feel like ""home"" if that have sense.   

Maybe I'm being selfish but I know I'm going to resent it for a long time and I'll never forget it.  I have given a lot for our relationship and I only ask for that day but yeah, I knew what I was doing when I married him just maybe didn't believe it or I thought he could change.

"title: AITA for asking a girl at my work if she's okay and safe
content: I work at a restaurant and I noticed a really creepy looking, tall old white man with two young Hispanic looking girls, one of them (the older one) with a nervous/sad-ish expression on her face. She and the other girl sat on the opposite side of the table from this man and he was talking to them and leaning over the table towards them while doing so. It seemed a little weird to me so I checked to make sure they weren't on a missing persons list, but didn't see them. I kept getting more worried thinking women should help other women and look out for one another, and I was genuinely worried about these girls. I told my manager about it and he agreed that it was a little fishy. Of course I had good intentions, but maybe I watch too many crime shows, because I walked out there when the man was leaving and the girls were by themselves if they were okay and the older one snarkily responded with: ""yeah, why??"" So I said ""Oh, I just wanted to make sure you're safe and not in a dangerous situation."" She caught major attitude (and maybe rightfully so) and said that she was completely fine, that the man was her dad, and wanted to know why I would ever think somethings wrong. In the end, she said ""I find that really offensive that you would think that"" and of course I apologized multiple times before she walked off angry... When she went outside she immediately told the man (her dad) what happened and he came in and spoke with my manager about it and said that it was a little hurtful but it was okay. Ever since then I've just felt extremely guilty and sad, but I was honestly just trying to look out for other girls. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for asking a group to turn off their music in a public park?
content: I (28F) went to a local park yesterday with lots of open green space near a local university. It was a nice day and being in England as soon as the sun comes out everyone (including me) flocks to the park to enjoy an ice cream and some fresh air. I arrived and found a space away from other people to lie down and relax. I was really enjoying taking some time with no distractions to listen to the sound of the birds, the kids playing in the distance and the gentle breeze.
After about 10 minutes a group of 4 people probably in their late teens-early 20s came and sat about 2 metres away from me despite there being plenty of space further away which would be just as nice and sunny. I didn't mind them sitting there but they immediately started being loud and obnoxious, and started playing music on their phone speaker (Sean Paul among other things). Not only did they play this music full volume the girls started ""singing"" along badly to the point I couldn't ignore it anymore.
I let this go on for 10 minutes or so before asking them politely if they could turn their music off because they're disturbing the peace and quiet, and not everyone wants to hear Sean Paul. They looked at me like I was an alien and said no because it's a public park, if I didn't like it I could move elsewhere, despite the fact I was there first! I tried to stay calm and said yes, it is a public park so they should respect that and not be obnoxiously loud. They got mad and told me f*ck off if I don't like it and no one else seems bothered.
I decided not to pursue it any further and just left, but AITA for thinking it's entitled and rude to play music on loud speaker and scream along to it in a public place?

TLDR; I asked a group of people to turn off their loud music in a public park because it's disturbing the peace, they said no and told me to leave despite the fact I was there first.",yta
"title: AITA for asking boyfriend to bring me a spare?
content: 
I (27f) work as a ICU nurse in a large hospital. This past Friday, as I was getting off my shift, I accidentally locked my keys in my car. 
I was irritated, but there was a spare  at my parents and my mother agreed to make the 30min drive to the hospital to bring it to me. 40 minutes later, she calls and says this is a no-go: she’s used up all her data and although the hospital’s a straight shot, she’s not doing it without a GPS. She suggests she drive to my boyfriend’s town and meet him at a grocery store (would have gone to his house but again, no GPS) to do a handoff. I suspected boyfriend (33m) would be irritated by this but I figured in the long run it wouldn’t be a big deal. Grocery store (10min),  hospital (15 min), back. He had been off from his WFH job for several hours and did not work the next day. 
When I called him and explained the situation he told me that he had food being delivered in 15 minutes and seemed hesitant to want to pick up the key. I said that was fine, it’s gonna take mom about 25 to get to the store so he could definitely wait until the food arrived. He then angrily asked me what I wanted him to do about this situation I was in, and I reexplained the game plan and told him if he couldn’t do it to tell me because my phone was going dead and I would have to figure something else out. He said something along the lines of “well get back inside the hospital *now* and figure out a way to charge it because if I get down there and can’t find you I’m going to be really pissed off” and proceeded to barrage me with a bunch of spitfire questions about how this whole thing was going to go down. I was trying to provide relevant information and do what he asked (writing down phone numbers, giving him contact info) but he kept angrily talking over me and cutting me off. The entire phone conversation his tone was pretty harsh and clipped. I completely understood that he was irritated, but he sounded utterly pissed off. When he got what he needed he just hung up. 
Long story short, he did end up picking me up. I had walked a short distance away from the deck to an intersection so it would be easier to see me, and he pulled to the side of the road, practically shoved the key at me, and sped off. I had no problem walking back to my car (only 5-6min) but he left me on the side of to road at 10pm without even checking to make sure I was safe to hoof it back to the deck, which I thought was kind of cold. 
Got to the car, received a text from him to come home, I’m like great maybe we can talk about WTF just happened. When I got home he didn’t even acknowledge I was there, just completely ignored me. I was so tired and overwhelmed at this point I just left to go to my parents house. I told him later that I didn’t not want him talking to me like that but he thinks he reacted normally given the situation, and now I’m wondering if I asked for too much?",nta
"title: AITA for asking for a refund when my package was stolen?
content: I, 25-year-old male, was buying sneakers from a seller that my friends had done business with, so I thought he was legitimate. I took the approach of pay half now, and then pay the second half at meetup, and went ahead to schedule it. **The first time I attempt to meet up**, he said to reschedule and meet him the next day. I agreed, paid him half and then prepared for the meet up. 

The next day rolls around and I let him know that I'm on the way. He tells me that unfortunately he's at work and he can't meet. So we reschedule for a **second time,** the following Monday. It comes and I'm trying to contact him about trying to meet up - he doesn't reply. Later in the day he tells me that his grandma passed away and he's been out with family, so I understood and told him to take his time with processing everything. 

However, I did need those shoes for another sale that I was trying to make, and because the deal came and went, due to his reschedules, I asked if I could just get a refund of the half that I paid him. He said that he missed out on sales too because he held them for me, and that we did agree to meet up, it's just that things got in the way on his end. We agree to handle the transaction finally at the end of the week - **the third reschedule.**

End of the week rolls around and he again says that he can't make it but can still meet up later on. I tell him I could meet him the next day. And he agrees that we can do that - **the fourth reschedule.**

Next day rolls around and he, again, **has something come up**. So he finally tries to refund the half that I paid. He tries to send it to me and it never shows up in my account. We try contacting customer support but they say that the seller has authorize the payment so that it can get sent back to me - I try telling him that and he says that he sees nothing. I try to request the refund and the request shows up on his end but money is gone from his end and it's not showing up on my end.

So I say screw it and have him ship the item to me. I paid the remaining balance and also paid for the shipping so that I could see the shipping take place. He documents himself packing the shoes and dropping them off at the post office.

The package finally arrives but when I open the box it's filled with nothing but trash bags. I called USPS who was only able to get me 100$ because there was no insurance on it. I asked if I could at least get a small amount back from the seller so that we could split the loss. He says that there was no way he was going to give me a refund and that when he ships something, it's not longer in his hands and what happened is unfortunate but not on him. He tried refunding me and it wouldn't go through and then I was the one to propose shipping, not him. He claims that he has a life too and can't meet up any second of any day and he's had a lot going on, and he said that he's been responsive in this whole ordeal. 

Bottom line: Am I the asshole for asking for a sliver of a refund after my package was stolen?",info

content: I (28F) and a group of friends planned to celebrate another friend’s (24F) birthday out of town. Birthday Girl planned to get an Airbnb for everyone, requested we all send over $200 in January to book the trip for April. Some shit started to happen and then it slowly started to fall apart and she was debating cancelling. Then the Airbnb host canceled the reservation and apparently deleted their account with Airbnb- according to BG. She then said Airbnb was refusing to refund the money, x reason, y reason, etc. In April she said she would start making payments come May. I told her that was fine as idc I just want my money back. Then I messaged her this week and now its “next month I’ve got a lot going on”… yet her and her husband have been out and about, taking trips, going to nice dinners, etc. I also have a lot going on, including an autism evaluation next month that’s gonna cost $900. I don’t want to be a bitch but it’s been almost 6 months. AITA for telling her idc and she’s had plenty of time to figure it out? And is small claims court worth it or should I just cut my losses?

"title: AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""
content: I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


I got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?",nta

"title: AITA for asking if my cousin made her first million yet?
content: Hello friends, I'm from the future. Throwaway, yada yada.

Well, technically we're a few hours away from 2021. So advanced happy new year.

I'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.

Family from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.

As is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. 

While listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. 

She began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. 

Now, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. 

I don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said ""I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?"" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, ""You guys made your first million yet? Because I have."" 

The room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.

Was I an asshole?

P.S. First million in our local currency not USD.",info

content: **EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. 

He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for asking my boyfriend to be nicer and more empathetic towards me?
content: I (28f) and my boyfriend (25) are in a long distance relationship, we haven’t been together for long (3 months). We got into an argument 3 days ago, we were talking and I said that it’s raining and I think I’ll get out to have a walk under the rain because I love doing that! His response was literally “I feel like I’m talking to my niece, a girl of 4 or 5 years old. You’re only grown/an adult in paper but still like doing childlike things like running and playing under the rain!? Haha” then he rambled on how weird it is for “grown @$$” people to do that and that he’s too “cool” for such behaviours … I was taken aback by this and said that I said I’d have “a walk” under the rain not play but even if that’s what I said which is what a lot of people enjoy doing, if that’s not your thing ,fine but why make fun of/judge people who do!!! I told him that his response was inappropriate and he did not have to say that. He said he was just joking and I took it seriously, and since that’s not how he “meant” it, he basically didn’t care and he won’t “joke” with me again. 

I told him this is what I meant in the previous argument we had when I said I was sick of his lack of empathy and compassion towards me, if he does something shitty, even without his intention, he would not care nor empathise with me and the way it made me feel. For example, if I do or say something that hurts him (of course without my intention to do so), I’ll be trying to see things from his perspective, explain to him what I meant and apologise if I caused him harm and try to figure out what he needs at that moment. 

If he doesn’t see that he’s wrong, he’d not be empathetic or try to work it out or anything then gets mad at me!!!! Like excuse me, why are you mad that I’m upset because you made me upset???
The situation ended with him being upset that I got upset and we haven’t talked fo 3 days now.

PS: There were instances where he took accountability and apologised. 

I’m genuinely confused, AITA for maybe taking what he said too seriously??",nta
"title: AITA for asking my boyfriend to spend the rest of the day with me
content: I (22 F) and my boyfriend (23M) recently got into a big argument over me asking him to spend the rest of the day with me.

So on Friday night, my boyfriend came home and was telling me that this Saturday he and his friends have something planned and he’ll be gone the entire day. I said okay, and then a hour later he tells me that he’s actually going to go to his friend’s house tonight too. This normally would not be a big deal, but for the past two and a half months he has spent the entire weekend, Friday through Sunday, with his friends and would not come home at all until Sunday at like 1 a.m.

 We both work full-time jobs, so he leaves before I wake up, and I work later than him, so even though we live together, we kind of don’t spend a lot of time with each other M-Thurs, and on Sundays, we both have stuff to catch up on like laundry, work,etc. I told him this and asked if he could just spend the rest of the night with me since we haven’t really spent time with each other the last few weeks.

It then turned into a huge argument. He told me that I was being an asshole and trying to control him by not letting him see his friends. I told him that’s not true because he’s seen them every weekend for the past few weeks and all I want to do is spend one day together. He followed up by telling me that he’s a human and can do whatever he feels like, If I’m bored I can hang out with my sister or my friends. (That confused me because it’s not boredom; I just wanted to see my boyfriend.) I then explained again that I’m not telling him that he can’t see them. I just want to spend Friday together, but he would not let up or hear me out. He kept telling me that I was in the wrong for getting upset about him just wanting to go see his friends, that what I was doing was toxic, and that I was trying to manipulate him/the conversation by bringing up how many times he's seen them. I told him that I just wanted a compromise. I don’t feel like he has to choose between seeing me or his friends, but it would be nice if he could make time for both because at the moment he’s only making time for them. The argument just kept going like that until he left the house and didn’t come home again until Sunday evening. He’s still adamant that I was in the wrong and that I’m being stubborn by not seeing his side of things.

I just want to know if I’m truly in the wrong here. If I am, I will apologize, but I’m having a hard time seeing how I’m wrong. (And I’m very aware that this issue is super childish, but he was genuinely upset, like screaming at the top of his lungs.)",nta

"title: AITA for asking my ex-boyfriend to move out of my Aunts home?
content: My (M23) ex boyfriend (M28) moved to London from South America in 2019. When we dated I saw that he rented a tiny shared room with 4 other people, it was horrific. So I asked my Mum if he could rent in my Grandma’s home for very cheap.

Unfortunately, my grandma died a year later and the house went up for sale. It was mid-covid and he was an unemployed student, so my Mum agreed to move him into my Aunts house as he would’ve been homeless, once again, for very cheap. The room could be listed at £1500 p/month as it’s huge and in central London, but he gets it for £450.

Since then, he graduated from college, left his minimum wage retail jobs and is working from home in the Tech industry. He’s on amazing money now but his rent only increased about £90 per month as my aunt is afraid to increase his rent (probably bc he’s my bf). To make things worse, he invited his best friend from his home country (who he lied told my aunt was his cousin) to rent in my Aunts. My aunt is old (75 years old) and doesn’t want to say no to be nice, so she agreed and his friend now rents there too. I asked him not to let his best friend rent there, but he didn’t listen and it went ahead.

I found out my boyfriend got a visa which allows him to work in the UK full-time, and he instantly broke up with me. I felt used. Like he used me and my family for accommodation until he got his visa and then broke up. He has no desire to leave my aunts as he’s using the money he saves renting there to invest in property in his home country.

Personally, I want him gone. I’m too young to deal with a 28-year-old ex renting with my aunt because he’s cheap and is investing in property. I’m finding it hard to move on. The day we broke up he downloaded tinder, who does that after a 4 year relationship? I feel like he’s used me and is continuing to use my aunt.

I told him I want him to move out of my aunts and finally be independent and rent his own apartment because he has the funds to do so, but he declined and said he won’t leave until he’s evicted. That makes things messy, my aunt isn’t a registered landlord. She’s just letting him live there for pennies because he was my boyfriend. What do I do?!",yta
"title: AITA for asking my fiance to rehome his rescue dogs to my Aunt's farm?

The thing is, his dogs have caused us to cut short a lot of our plans, and I'm just not happy about it. I know he's done everything he can to make sure they're well taken care of by pet sitters, family and such so that they didn’t affect our plans and I always play with them, they are cute and I do love dogs, I just don’t love the idea of living with dogs.

Now that we're engaged and talking about building our dream house and starting a family, I'm starting to worry about having to live with his dogs. I know it sounds selfish, but it's just how I feel.

I know how much he loves his dogs, and I feel terrible but last night I asked him if he would consider rehoming them to an Aunt’s equine therapy farm. They're innocent souls and should be in a home where they will be truly wanted, loved, and cared for by all people under that roof. 

My Aunt and Uncle said they would happily take the pups and we could integrate them slowly into the farm over a couple of months. There are horses, dogs, llamas, goats, and other animals on the farm and they have programs specializing in therapy and rehabilitation. The farm is an hour away so we can visit anytime.

My fiancé has known since we first started dating that I wasn’t big on pets and never really warmed up to his dogs but he said he always expected that I would come around. He’s upset and hurt that I would ask this but I had to be honest before we moved further. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for asking my fiancé to not get drunk at his best friend’s wedding?
content: My partner, Phil (35m) and I (31f) have been invited to Phil’s best friend, Robbie’s wedding. Robbie (31m) and Phil have been best friends for at least ten years or so and Phil is one of the groomsmen. 

Phil and Robbie are part of a group of 4 friends along with Will (30s) and Luke (30s). IMHO, Phil is treated as the comic relief of the group. Robbie, Will, and Luke are image conscious and doing well for themselves financially. They’re also all in childless partnerships (and intend to continue that way).

Phil was known for getting wasted at parties in his teens and early twenties. I’ve heard all the stories that are brought up again and again at get togethers. Phil is pretty embarrassed about it all now and doesn’t drink like he used to. 

Still, Phil sometimes forgets his limits. At Luke’s wedding, Phil had promised me that he would not get wasted. I was DD so he could have some beers with his mates, my parents had our (at the time) 4 month old son at their house, and we were staying with them after the wedding. 

Phil got to about 8 pints and I gently suggested that he should make it his last one. Because you know, hangovers are horrible and worse with a 4 month old baby. I didn’t want him to make a fool of himself and then have it held over his head for years by his friends. And in all honesty, it’s embarrassing. 

Robbie took exception to this. He moaned about it and kept plying Phil with alcohol. Phil continued to drink and was very drunk by the end of the night. I was really upset and felt disrespected. Cut to the next morning with a worse for wear Phil feeling very sorry for himself. 

Anyway, Robbie is getting married in a few months and they met up at the weekend to discuss groomsmen things. Robbie has brought it up a few times since Luke’s wedding that I was “ruining the fun” by asking Phil to stop drinking. He’s said that Phil doesn’t need my permission to get drunk. 

Robbie has made it clear that he wants Phil, Luke, and Will to drink heavily together at his wedding. He even wants them to go out clubbing the night before the wedding. Robbie seems to think that I am preventing Phil from having a good time at the wedding and will somehow impact his day as a whole? I told Phil that I am happy for him to drink but I would prefer he didn’t get drunk. We’re paying for a hotel room, we’ve got a kid free night- it would be nice to enjoy the wedding together and actually remember it the next day. Phil told me that he feels like he’s having to choose between upsetting his friend or disrespecting me. So AITA?",info

content: My friend, Ruby (f31) and I (F32) have known each other since we were 18. 
Right after her masters, Ruby decided she doesn't want to work in her field and decided to start a small business selling candles and soaps. She claims she's been able to make a living doing that but I've never seen her business accounts so I can't confirm nor deny. She lives alone so unless her parents are helping her (her parents are dirt poor though) she must at least make a minimum wage.

I never questioned her life choices although I found them odd. What's the point of getting degrees but not using them for anything is beyond me. 

I met Ruby for coffee on bank holiday Monday and we were chatting. I complained about work, that I was overlooked for promotion again. She sympathised. But when I asked her what's new about her work, she perked up. Honestly, I kind of expected her to keep her success on the downlow considering that I was down regarding my job but she didn't hold back. Apaprently, she's just finished editing her book (i had no idea she was writing one) and she sent it to an editor for edits before quering. And she's about to launch her true crime youtube channel because she's been filming videos for the past few months so she has a few months prerecorded.
To say that my jaw dropped would be an understatement. This is a woman in her 30s who's still playing around like a child. No real responsibilities, jumping from one thing to another without a care in the world.

I care about her so I thought someone had to say it. I asked her when she was planning on getting a real job.
""What do you mean,"" she asked me.
I explained to her that I thought it was the right time to get a real job as she can't play all her life and it'll come back to bite her when she's older and needs some professional experience when her little ventures fail.

She got really offended and told me she never expected me to say this and thought I was supportive but I was like the other people who belittled her accomplishements.
I said I was nothing like them and I wasn't belittling them but recording a few videos and make a few candles wasn't that big of an accomplishement and that with her intelligence she was selling herself short when she could be really accomplished if she only worked in her profession.

She told me to fuck off and left the lunch.
I thought she'd call apologising but no luck. My husband told me I was the asshole because she's my friend and even if I didn't like it, I should've played along but I don't know if I agree with him. Real friends tell the truth and I couldn't just coddle her, she needed someone to show her that she's wasting her time.

"title: AITA for asking my gf to pay back a loan?
content: My (29M) partner (29NB) and I have been dating for about a year. She's abroad right now and about a month ago, she got locked out of her accounts and asked me to borrow $200-300. I generally like to avoid lending money to people because I know it can make things weird but it was an emergency. I agreed on the understanding that: 1. she did have the money in another account that she could use to pay me back and 2. It wouldn't take more than a week or two for her to get access to it and be able to pay me back.

Sure enough she did get access to the accounts and she brought it up when we were chatting one day, less than two weeks later. She started mentioning the different options for sending the money and i didn't feel like figuring it out right then since it was complicated due to her being abroad, so I said don't worry about it right now, let's figure it out later. Unfortunately this is where a misunderstanding took place. I think she understood what I said to mean that i didn't really care how soon I got the money back and she went ahead and spent the money on other things.

The topic of her finances came up a few days ago - specifically she was saying that things are tight for her financially. It occurred to me on hearing this that she might have spent the money she was going to use to pay me back so I decided to bring it up before whatever money she does have disappeared. I told her that I'd like to get the money back sometime soon. She says she could get it to me in a day or two, which might be hard, or in like 2-3 weeks, which would be easier. To me another 2-3 weeks sounded like too long (it has already been longer than we discussed) so I said soon would be better.

But she was upset that I was now saying I wanted it back soon after not seeming to care that much before. Now we're in a conflict. She wants me to be more flexible because of the financial situation she's in and says that she is much more generous and understanding when she's lent people money in the past. I am down to be flexible and meet in the middle but I'm annoyed that she spent the money she owed me and don't like being seen as the bad guy for asking for it back in the timeline we agreed on (actually longer).

I then told her she looked great but then continued to ask "" could you please change just for dinner? I love your style and you but my parents are really judgemental and i'm not sure the restaurant allows outfits like that"" She then told me I was suppressing her creative outlet and trying to change her. That kinda hurt me because I never wanted to offend her. I then asked her again, ""Dahlia please just this once"". She then refused, my main issue is I come from a culture that is very conservative and arranged marriages are common so I worry if they see her outfit they'll be more inclined to force me into one. I told her that and she called me backwards.

He got upset and told me he wanted to go to soccer and wanted us to do this as a family.

This has been an on going conversation for the past half a year and she keeps saying she will think about it. If she were to add him to the plan, she wouldn't be able to change who's on it for another year so I can completely understand why she'd want one of her friends. I mentioned this but also said I found it strange that this had been ongoing for so long and she still hadn't changed who was on the benefits. She brushed it off and just said that she'd want her friend and that was all. Then I said she didn't treat him that well and really acts like he won't be around long, and told her that he is my family. To which she responded, ""for now"".

 I let her know how I felt about a recent disagreement we had had about a trip to Thailand. When I had initially brought the trip up, she thought it was a great idea. Then I mentioned that my boyfriend wanted to go with me. (All funds would be paid by us, not here so money shouldn't be the defining factor.
) and she was suddenly against it. Then I said my brother wanted to come and she was suddenly for it again. When I brought this up to her today, she went on saying how it didn't make sense for my boyfriend to go and would be a waste. I tried asking how travelling with someone i love would be a waste and she basically said that I need to date other people and that if we somehow end up back together, then we were meant to be. She also mentioned that she felt shes doing us a huge favor already and started making me feel guilty for staying with her. I was trying to talk myself out of feeling bad since I've put countless hours of work into fixing her house, and had even finished the floor today, not to mention that we buy all the food, and cook all the meals we eat.

At this point, I'm bawling and shes asking me why I'm freaking out and overreacting. I don't think she has seen me cry for 5 or more years so it's not like I cry 24/7 around her. All I could get out is ""you don't listen to me. You don't understand what im saying or try to listen."" then she said, ""so you're going to cry and be all upset just because I didn't take your side and because you didn't get what you want?""

Am I the asshole?",info
"title: AITA for asking my mom to not talk until she's finished chewing?
content: My mom is 63 and has had dentures, a full top and partial bottom set, for at least 10 years. She hasn't been to the dentist since she got her dentures since she said they are good for life with no adjustment. However, she's recently been complaining that they're loose and moving while she chews. My sister is a dental assistant and has told her she can adjust them quite easily for free. She's been chewing with her mouth open, which really bothers me but I don't say anything because she can't help that she has dentures at her age. However, since she is chewing so slow, she just talks with her mouth full. She doesn't even cover it with her hand or tuck it into her cheek. Food has actually fallen out her of mouth a few times. After a month or more of the worsening problem, I accidentally made a face when this was happening because it really bothers me. She asked what I was doing and I admitted that it bothered me that she talked with her mouth full. She seemed offended and embarrassed. I said that sheshould go to the dentist or let my sister fix the dentures because not only is it making her life harder, but other people probably find it uncomfortable too.

"title: AITA for asking my neighbors to not hold children’s day camp in their backyard during the weekend?
content: So some context: we ( I, 23F and my parents 50F and 58M) live in a really quiet neighborhood with mostly senior citizens. A few years ago our direct neighbor decided to hold a week long children’s camp in their backyard. At first in seemed like a nice initiative and we didn’t have any problems with it. Things started to stir up last summer when the one week camp transformed into a whole summer thing with 15-20 children screaming and playing outside every 2-3 days during the week and sometimes during the whole weekend. European houses don’t have AC, we usually just open the windows but last summer we either opened the windows to hear the sound of a straight up kindergarten the whole afternoon or just close everything and stay in the hot house. We had enough during my finals week at Uni when I could barely study in peace and kindly messaged them to take into consideration keeping the outside playtime to a minimum during this time to which they blocked me and installed a higher fence, as if it’s going to keep the noise down.

Summer is coming up and it after weeks of noise we messaged them again this Sunday that we do not agree with this activity and the noise they are making but they do not wish to compromise, they just bring arguments in their favor, saying it’s for the children. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for asking my parents for their entire estate if they want me to be my sister's guardian.
content: I (F23) have been told my entire life that if anything happens to my parents I will be my sister's guardian. She is 33 and has some disabilities. She is currently living in a group home. The government pays for a good portion of the cost but not all.  My parents have made sure that they have accessed every resource available for her to make sure she has as good a life as she can. 

I was we were visiting her this last weekend when they brought it up again.  They are both reasonably healthy but they both had health scares in the last couple of years.  They once again said that I would be her guardian.  

I have been giving this a fair bit of thought. I have two older brothers. They are both married and established in their careers. They would be better choices than I am.  

I want to go see the world. I am lucky enough that my job can be done from anywhere that I can access the internet.  

When we went sort dinner I brought it up and said that I had three ideas.  

1. They make all three of us her guardians so we could split the responsibilities and duties. 

2. They leave their entire estate to my sister in a trust that will oversee her care. 

3. They leave me their entire estate with the proviso that I become her sole guardian and take full responsibility. Minus sentimental stuff for the rest of my family obviously. 

I thought that was fair since it's not like they are rich and their estate will mostly consist of their house and the insurance policies they took out when they realized the long term costs of care for my sister.  

They said that I'm trying to shirk my responsibility to my sister and that I'm greedy for trying to get everything.  

I had one last suggestion and they really hated it.  I said that they were welcome to cut me completely out of their will.  But that had to include guardianship of my sister.  They could leave everything to her and my brothers but that meant I would be completely free of responsibility for her care.  

My dad got really angry and my mom was crying when I left.  

My brothers both called me to say I was being an asshole springing this on my parents. And that I was being greedy trying to keep them and their families from getting anything when our parents pass away.  I asked both if them if they wanted 100% responsibility for our sister in return for the entire estate. I volunteered to sign away everything to them.  Neither one took me up on the offer.",nta

"title: AITA for asking my son and daughter inlaw for a copy of the key to the new house they bought?
content: 

2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion.

We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said ""I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!"". She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying ""Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing"" but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful .

My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be ""demanding"" a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner.

I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",yta
"title: AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?
content: My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

"title: AITA for asking my(24f) boyfriend(26m) and his friend to quiet down?
content: My boyfriend and I’s bedroom is kn the basement of our house, the small room right outside our bedroom door is used as a computer/gaming room that mainly my boyfriend uses. This is normally fine, sometimes I’ll have to ask him to quiet down a bit because he’ll play until late hours into the night/early morning when I am trying to sleep.

Well this last night his best friend came over. They’ve been friends since elementary and he only sees him every couple weeks to one-two months because of their busy work schedules (I will add they play games online with each other almost nightly and talk on the mic, I know that’s different than physically hanging out but they usually just sit and game when they hang out anyways)

Well, it got into the very late/early morning hours and they were talking very loudly in the gaming room right outside my bedroom door, I don’t work tomorrow so I didn’t say anything until maybe 3:30am/4:00am, and just asked them to turn down the games volume because I could hear it over my tv. They still kept talking loudly after this and finally at about 5:30am I VERY politely asked them to quiet down and apologized because I knew they were having fun, but I need sleep and I can’t stay up until crazy hours in the morning like them.

They quieted down but I cant help but feel the annoyance from my boyfriend since they haven’t seen eachother in a while and might not for another while. I feel bad cause I feel like I ruined their friend night, but also feel like 5:30am is a more than reasonable time to ask them to quiet down. AITA?",info
"title: AITA for asking our daughter not to stomp or jump sometimes for the sake of our neighbor?
content:  

I am using a throwaway account.

Also English is not my first language so please forgive any mistakes.

For context we live in an apartment building on the last floor, our floor was built recently whereas the building was built in the 1960s. Therefor our flooring is different from the rest of the building and thinner.

Our neighbor from downstairs came to us once complaining that it is too loud to the point it is unbearable, my husband went down with him and listened to the sounds and it was really loud and annoying especially that we have a two year old.

So we came to the agreement that we cannot control our child 100% of the time but we will try our best to reduce the amount of stomping and stop it completely at certain times like early mornings.

Recently my MIL, SIL and niece visited and were always annoyed how we would ask them not to stomp loudly at the ""quiet times"" mandated by the building and how we would ask our daughter to not jump on the floor and direct her to jump on the rubber matt instead.

My MIL said that we are assholes to dictate how our guests should walk and that we will cause our daughter issues by limiting her movement which I disagree with since we do not restrict her movement all the time, we just limit the amount of noise that's it and we do not mind teaching her to respect others.

So reddit AITA here?

Note: we do take our daughter outside a lot and she also goes to daycare where she can jump all she wants. We also have rubber mats that absorb the sound for her to jump inside.",nta
"title: AITA for asking people to get along?
content: I (26M) am graduating from Law School next week. It’s a pretty big deal for me, as it’s something I’ve been working towards for several years now. My school is considered one of the top law schools in the country, and as far as accomplishments in life go, this is definitely my biggest one. 

I have asked my family to come watch my graduation. They are all flying into town for the event, and I have planned a nice dinner for all of us to celebrate after the graduation ceremony. The guest list includes myself, my parents, my dads second wife, as well as my older brother and his wife. 

To put it lightly, my family does not get along. My parents had a messy divorce a few years ago and things have not improved since then. The worst tension is between my brother and my dad. They barely speak to each other and are always at odds. Their respective spouses have also gotten involved in their feud, making matters much worse. 

My brother called me and told me that I am being selfish for expecting everyone to come together for this event. He says I that I’m being narcissistic and just want people to praise me. He called me a “chaos agent” who is forcing everyone to interact so that I can watch them argue. 

I don’t think that I’ve done anything wrong. I have a good relationship with all of them, and don’t think it’s too much to ask for everyone to get along for one weekend to celebrate my graduation. It really does mean a lot to me—I don’t have a partner or many friends to celebrate with. 

I feel like they’re the ones being unreasonable. All my colleagues have family coming in to celebrate, and setting aside my family’s issues for one weekend shouldn’t be that difficult. Am I the asshole for forcing my family to come together, even though they all dislike each other?",yta
"title: AITA for asking someone to stop screaming at the Taylor Swift concert?
content: My sister and I (f 30s) went to the TS concert and were next to three girls (early 20s I’d guess) who screamed and shrieked and wailed the entire first half of the show. This was not normal singing/screaming along. These girls were purposefully being as loud as they possibly could be in hopes of getting Taylor’s attention. I know for a fact they were aware of how obnoxious they were because they were making TikToks and literally said “we are gonna be the loudest bitches on Nashville night 2” and every time Taylor looked in the general area of our section they flipped out, genuinely convinced that she heard them. 

I thought for sure they’d lose their voices or quiet down, but were somehow even LOUDER during the folklore set (halfway through the show). Maybe it’s because those are quieter songs and everyone else was relaxing a bit. Not these girls. I finally leaned over and said could you please try not to scream, it’s really hard to hear Taylor. One of the girls looked mortified, one of them said sure no problem, and the third girl gave me the stink eye. They were quiet for the rest of folklore, but at 1989 when the music picks up the stink eye girl resumed her banshee screams, the second girl was loud but not obnoxious, and the first girl barely seemed to be singing at all. 

On the drive home, my sister said I can’t believe you told those girls to shut up. I didn’t tell anyone to shut up, I politely asked them to stop screaming. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for attending my ex’s wedding?
content: Jack (24) and I (23) dated durning middle school/high school. We have been friends since childhood as we were neighbors. We broke up last year of high school since I wanted to move abroad for college and he wanted to stay in our city. It wasn’t that dramatic, we both felt it’s time to move on. 

So I came back to my hometown around a year ago. I moved back to my parents to save some money and it turned out that Jack still lives with his parents, his girlfriend Emma and their daughter. We started talking again here and there, he told me he got together with Emma because he got her pregnant at some party but then he got to know her better and fell for her. I also met Emma at a barbecue and she was nothing but nice. Jack and I started playing tennis together as we used to back in the day but he asked me not to tell Emma as she is over sensitive about any women in his life. Honestly, I just missed my childhood best friend so I didn’t mind the secret. I just enjoyed spending time with him platonically. 

In the meantime I started dating Eric, but I never talked about it or posted about it.

Few months ago Jack and Emma invited my parents, my siblings and me for their wedding. On my invitation was written that I am invited with a +1. I even confirmed to be attending with a partner but to Jack’s mom, since it was her who handled it. 

So yesterday we attended the wedding and it got sour very quickly. Both Jack and Emma got drunk early on. Emma and her friend came over to me since her friend wanted to “solve it once and for all”. Emma told me she thinks it’s cruel of me to show up to their wedding after what happened. It turned out at The Groom's Party Jack got wasted and started telling everyone I’m the one who got away and it’s me who he should be marrying. It quickly got to her so they apparently argued before the wedding and she blamed me on it. Says I'm a massive asshole to get in between the family. Then also Jack appeared and told me it’s AH move to bring Eric with me, since it’s what everyone will talk about, instead of the wedding. He called me cruel for parading him around. Then Jack and Emma started to argue over it as he “shouldn’t even care” and the party was basically over. 

No one in my family blames me but they did call me “attention seeking”. I don’t talk with either Emma or Jack but I feel guilty. AMTA?",yta

He tells me I should take care of my partner as women should take care of all of their partners' needs. I don't cook a lot and he was saying I'm a shitty housewife (I have a job and I'm not a stay at home girlfriend). He was snooping around our apartment and when we locked it he was verbally abusive to us. He was going through our trash too, commenting on our food choices. He also talked bad about us to other people. You get the picture.

I was cooking, cleaning, going grocery shopping for him and he was constantly criticizing me, making innapropriate sexual comments, telling me what should I do with my life, etc. I talked with my partner and he talked to his grandpa numerous of times. He always says I'm lying and that he's a poor man that needs help. 

I wasn't at my parents for two months at that time so I decided I'm going away for a weekend. When I left, he called me and said I'm selfish because he needs help (note that my MIL took all of the care over), etc.

The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue.

Days ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this.

"title: AITA for being ""rude"" to my ex's new girlfriend?
content: I (24NB) dated David (25M) for three years. We broke up about two years ago. I started dating Connor (25M) pretty much immediately after we broke up. David was single for a while but started dating Anna (27?F) about six months ago. I hadn't seen David since the break up, but I bumped into him and his girlfriend at a restaurant about five months ago when I was with Connor and we got up and walked out.

David and I still have a mutual friend in Brian (25M). Brian told me that David has never been happier since he started dating Anna. He said she's from Europe, she's super smart, speaks five languages and he has never seen David so happy. I said she can't be that smart if the only thing she does with her life is teach brats their ABCs and how to use the washroom (I'm a nurse who saves lives on a daily basis). 

A few weeks ago, Brian told me that David was planning on moving back to wherever Anna is from. She got accepted onto a master's program and he is also planning on starting an MA in a field he always wanted to work in. He was accepted on to a really prestigious MA program in the same field here when we were dating but he turned it down because he had some really bad mental health problems and I didn't think he needed the extra stress. Apparently now that he's dating Anna his mental health problems have magically disappeared? Also, David has never left Ontario before and now he's moving to Europe for her? 

Anyway, about two weeks ago, I was with Connor and Brian having lunch. This girl walked in and I immediately thought she was so beautiful. She was tall like a model and looked like Emily Deschanel. Brian's entire fucking face lit up and said ""Anna! How are you? What are you doing here?"" I've never seen him that happy to see anyone and he gave her a huge hug. She had such a thick accent that I could barely understand her. Brian asked about the move, and she said she was excited to go back home but would miss Canada. He had the audacity to tell her he would miss her!

After they chit-chatted about nothing for a few minutes, Brian introduced me to her. She smiled and said ""oh hi! It's so nice to meet you"" and opened her arms as if she wanted to HUG me!!!!! I just turned away and didn't say anything. She said ""that's very odd, very strange behavior."" Brian started profusely apologizing and she said ""it's not your fault, Brian. You're not the one being rude."" She then made an excuse and left.

Brian was furious with me for being so ""rude"" to Anna because she's so lovely and has never done anything to me. I just told him that Anna is not better than me and I'm not going to pretend I like her just because everyone else seems to. Brian hasn't responded to my calls and texts since the incident, but Connor backed me up and said Anna seems like a bitch and it was presumptive of her to think I wanted to hug her. I really miss hanging out with Brian and want to make up, but I don't think I did anything wrong?

"title: AITA for being a picky eater and calling my ex a terrible cook?
content: I (30f) am a picky eater. Prestory: when I was younger it was impossible to make me eat a lot of food and I was also diagnosed with some sensory issues while eating, that is part of the pickiness. Things got better as I grew older and I was able to cook for myself the dishes I like and that are nutritionally healthy (mainly I don't like foods that are drenched in fat and feel heavy). I was lucky to get a well paying job early in my life (20), so instead of cooking I have decided to try the ready meal delivery service as a lot of these are healthy and offer a choice and I hate cooking.

At 21 I got married to ""Pete""(23m). Pete insisted on cooking himself and make me try new foods and was very against me ordering the ready meals, even for me it was easier and cheaper and the time I would spend cooking I could put into my career or hobbies. I didn't like anything he cooked as it tasted awful to me and I would end up having a bad stomach after. Essentially my ""pickiness"" was one of the reasons we divorced 3 years later.

Now to the current day. Last week my boss and I went to a business dinner with an owner and an assistant of the company that wanted to be our partners. The assistant ended up being Pete, which I was surprised to hear as he said he will never join the field I'm working in. Just before the dinner Pete was making snarky comments to his boss and mine about me being a picky eater and us divorcing because of it. However to his surprised I ordered a few dishes I would previously found disgusting and would eat them no problem. Pete went nuts and started asking a lot of inappropriate questions and nearly calling me names, until I got enough of it and said the reason why I was so picky with him was due to him being a terrible cook and that every of his dish would make me sick. His boss laughed and we carried on with the dinner.

The next day I have received a lot of texts from Pete calling me an asshole for what I said as now his boss has declined to come in to the dinner he was hosting for work and it is affecting his career.",nta

A year ago, we went low contact because she left for 2 months (for an internship in a different city) and when she came back she wasn't feeling social for a long period of time. I respected her wishes because I knew she struggled with some things and she needed her space. After a while a member of my family was diagnosed with a very serious health problem. It was very unexpected and I had to drop my plans for a master's degree to be close to my family. During that time I communicated to her that I wish we could spend a bit more time together because I missed her, I needed her support and wanted to see her more often. She agreed with me verbally but made zero actual effort to see me. I was always the one who suggested we go out and I rarely got a positive response. 

After months of me trying to reach out, she invited me one day out for coffee. That was to announce she was going to sign a civil partnership contract (correct me if I got the term wrong) with a guy she met online a year ago. This guy is from a different country but lives in the same country as us (in a different city), and needs the contract in order to stay in the country legally long-term. She also said she would be moving in with him in the city he lives in. 

I was surprised and told her that this wasn't something that I would do, but we talked about and she seemed very certain for her decision. She got defensive every time I questioned her relationship, so ultimately I told her I was happy for her if she was happy and she could do as she pleases with her life. But, aside from her relationship, I told her that I was hurt she only reached out to me when she had good news she wanted to share. All this time she made no effort and she honestly didn't even care to know about my life and what I had been up to. She seemed apologetic and asked what she could do to mend our friendship in the 2 weeks she had until she moved. I told her that she could do whatever she wanted, but this time I was not going to make a huge effort only to be ignored. She told me she will try her best. 

She left 3 months ago and she has not texted, not even once. I was emotionally ready for this so I just gave up on this friendship, at least for now. A couple of days ago I ran into a mutual friend of ours (mostly Anna's friend but we used to hang out all together) and she judged me for abandoning Anna in a period of her life when she needed full support for her new begging. I honestly don't know what to think for this judgement. I feel bad for my friend and I'm sad we don't have contact but I cannot be the one who does all the work again. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for being angry with a family member, after they gave us free childcare?
content: I want to start by saying I know how privelaged we are to have a family member provide us with childcare for free. It means my wife and I can work full time, without worrying who will pick the boys up from school.

Since our first son (5) was born, my wife's grandmother (Pam) insisted we should never pay for childcare and that she would have him whenever we needed.

This continued when our second was born, though we began trying to minimise how much we left them with her, as she got older and we noticed she tired more easily.

The problem began when our eldest began refusing to eat. It became a daily struggle to get him to eat anything, and we were concerned enough to speak with our health visitor, who assured us this was normal and advised us not to get angry with him, but to stick to meals strictly and not offer him treats or snacks throughout the day.

Pam WOULD NOT accept this instruction. Every time we'd pick him up, he'd have a chocolate bar, cake, gingerbread man, milkshake or some other crap in his hand. We tried soft reminder, we tried being firm but kind, and then finally today we returned from a growth scan for our unborn third baby, to find she had given him more treats, with the excuse ""you were late, he said he was hungry."" We had plenty of healthy food in, and on afraid we lost our temper and snapped at her.

You could feel the tension instantly in the room and she left without barely another word. This is the second time we've come to harsh words, the first time was a similar situation with her refusing to tell them off when they've been naughty, and even taking them out of time outs we'd put them in.

On that occasion, she complained to my wife's aunt that she felt underappreciated by us.

I regret snapping, and I truly do appreciate everything she does, but I'm sick of her ignoring our parenting calls because she thinks she knows better. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: Wife's grandma keeps feeding our kids treats against our wishes. We snapped at her.",nta
"title: AITA for being annoyed? It’s noon and I’m listening to a podcast on my portable Bluetooth speaker. Neighbors just knocked on the door and told me to turn it down.
content: I’m a 29 year old woman living in a very high cost of living area. I worked hard to finally get my own apartment in a safe neighborhood. A year ago, when I moved in, I had my boyfriend and best guy friend over to help me build some furniture midday (11AM) on a Sunday. We weren’t blasting music or throwing a party, we just were laughing together and goofing off. They came over fairly aggressively and told us we need to be quiet. Despite a family with a toddler living in this unit previously, they “never dealt with noise like this before”. It felt pretty unreasonable considering it was outside quiet hours (10PM-8AM), but I’m not one to pick a fight. I was pretty unhappy as I pay $2k a month to live here, but have tried to suck it up because it’s a great location. 

I’ve never really had guests over since. My boyfriend has stayed over maybe 4 times since then, but other than that, I always go to his place. I have two jobs, sleep at my boyfriend’s 90% of the time and am generally rarely home. Today, I decided to take the day off work and deep clean my apartment. I had a podcast on my portable Bluetooth (not big or enormously loud) while cleaning my kitchen at NOON and they came to knock on my to tell me to turn it down.

Of course, I turned it down because I’m not interested in fighting with them, but it really bothered me. I spend 2,000 USD a month to live here. I’ve lived in apartments before and I understand that part of living in an apartment is that you sometimes hear your neighbors. It’s just life living in an apartment! I wish I could afford a house, but I can’t yet. As long as it isn’t late at night or early in the morning, no big deal. My neighbors are two men in their fifties and I understand living in an apartment probably sucks at that age, but I feel like I should be able to have my portable Bluetooth speaker on while I do chores midday???  I have quiet hours on my lease of 10PM-8AM that I abide by and that should be enough. I could even understand if I did this constantly, but I’m literally never home and haven’t even had a guest in my own home since January. It feels almost like having shitty roommate, but it’s literally own apartment!!!  

TLDR; AITIA for being annoyed my neighbors asked me to turn down my Bluetooth midday?",nta
"title: AITA for being embarrassed of my girlfriend's cosplay?
content: My (25M) GF (24) had a double mastectomy 5 years ago; she had breast cancer, and thankfully made a full recovery. Unlike a lot of women, she didn't have any reconstructive surgery. This was before I met her. 

I'm a big anime nerd, and last weekend I invited her to a small anime con with me. She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us. So when I asked her to go to the con with me, she asked if she could cosplay, and I said sure. She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.

Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks. 

I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic. 

We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that. She got mad and said she was making the best of her situation and said I was being insensitive, and she's been distant ever since. I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for being honest about how I was bullied and how the teachers at my school did nothing about it while being interviewed by a current student?
content: I’m an author of mild success. I’m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.

I responded that my time at the school wasn’t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked “I’m sensing that you’re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?”

I said let’s focus on the story, and she was like “Actually this could be a better story.”

So I said y’know what, sure. Whatever. I don’t owe the school anything, I’m not being paid, and even though it’s been a long time and I’ve grown from what happened, it’s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I’d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.

I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn’t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me “Moolly” for the rest of the year and when I yelled “MY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY”* she had me suspended for a week.

She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went “viral” but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.

A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the “Moolly” incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?

Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I’m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can’t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven’t changed.

It was a long time ago, yes. I don’t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?

**Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. ",nta
"title: AITA for being hostile and rude to my sister's boyfriend over a joke he told my wife?
content: 
My sister (26) brought her new boyfriend (30) over to our parents house to meet him for the first time, My wife and I came as well.


We met the dude, he seemed ok-ish at first but he then started asking weird and personal questions. My wife had a breast cancer and got a single mastectomy last year. She told the story to my sister's boyfriend and he was like ""oh"" then he stared at my wife briefly then ""playfully"" said ""without even asking, I can pretty much tell which one got the blow"". We were floored, My wife could barely keep a straight face. she lied so she could leave the table cause she was literally about to tear up. I just looked at the dude and said ""Are you serious?"" he said ""What??!! I was just joking bro"" I started asking him to explain the joke to me, He just stared. I asked him again to explain it to me in details but still got no answer. My sister asked me to stop because clearly he got uncomfortable, but I insisted he explain the joke to me cause clearly....my wife and I didn't get it. Things got awkward with him avoiding eye contact while I just stared at him the entire time. I still insisted and asked him to explain the joke right there and then, but seconds later he said he needed to step outside to make a phone call. turns out he got in his car and left. My sister had a meltdown screaming and berating me for how I treated her boyfriend. Calling me hostle with anger issues to scare her boyfriend out of our parents house. I told her he was overstepping and made my wife uncomfortable to the point of crying, She actually called me wife ""such a princess"" and said she is soft and can not take some teasing. I had an argument with her and my parents intervened, I took my wife and left.


My dad called me later and said that he understood how hurt my wife felt but my sister's boyfriend was visiting for the first time and I showed hostility and agression instead of just ignoring him. He encouraged me to reach out to him and my sister later and talk it out but I declined.

AITA? Edit: My sister and my wife don't have a history but my sister tends to ""see"" the worst in people. When my wife announced her diagnosis, my sister actually thought she was ""faking"" because the family no longer brought up my wife's miscarriage months prior, I thought that was out of line and she apologized for it and we moved on. My sister thinks that the only ""bad trait"" she sees in her boyfriend is his smoking habit, she says thatvotherwise, he's ""perfect"". smfh.",nta
"title: AITA for being mad I can't get diagnosed?
content: So I (17F) have been trying to ask my mom to get me a diagnosis for the longest time (ADHD and Autism at minimum). I am aware that my research might be false and I might not actually have them, but I am almost 100% sure I do (I've put days into researching this because I have a fear of rejection, I am female, I want to be informed on the subject so I don't get treated like I'm dumb, and I hyper fixated on it for a couple weeks).  


Now, I mentioned to my mom (39F) that I wanted to get diagnosed and she just sighed at me. This wasn't the reaction I was expecting because she's usually pretty accepting about this kind of stuff. We talked about it and she asked if it was just okay that she knew I had ADHD (I never brought up the autism) and I said that ADHD is something I really want to talk to someone about and get help for. She said maybe and we've talked about it maybe 10 times in the past two years.

&#x200B;

Well yesterday, I finally brought it up again (And also brought up the autism) because she said we have a doctor's appointment soon and I asked if we could bring it up. This started a whole new argument and she said that she doesn't want me to get diagnosed because she believes it'll make people think of me worse especially when I'm travelling to places or trying to get a job. I said I almost didn't care about that because I'm almost 18 and that'll make getting a diagnosis worse and more expensive and she said she'll look into it again. Every time she's said that, it's never been true and I've always been the one to bring it up so I told her that and she got mad. I accused her of just not wanting a daughter with these diagnosis's and she said that that's not true. I asked if it was money then and she said nothing is the problem she just doesn't think it's right for me to get them.

&#x200B;

I just left and have accepted the fact that I was probably not going to be able to bring it up at the doctor's appointment, but my mom came to me defeated and said that I was allowed to bring it up and ask the doctor and it made me feel really bad. I talked to my friend and he said that the whole thing was just dumb and I shouldn't have made an argument and just waited till I was 18, but idk. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for being mad at my friends over birthday gifts?
content: We're a friend group of 4 people in total, and we're all turning 18 this year. As everyone knows, a person's 18th birthday is extremely important, so everyone plans big parties and their friends and family obviously think of the great gifts to give them for this important day.

I've always been meticulous about making personal and meaninful gifts, and this year i worked extra hard to make sure they all got nice gifts. 
The first one, E, got a kindle gift card of 30€ from us three, because we know she loves reading. The second one, S, got a whole ass kindle.
Following, there was my birthday, and i hoped to receive a nice gift, not even expensive, just personal. We celebrate and the time for presents finally comes, but i found myself very disappointed in finding a small set of gemstones which meant nothing to me or to them. I smiled and thanked them, weeks have passed, but i can't really force myself to like this gift. It doesn't represent me at all, and while it might've been a cute gift, it wasn't a gift for someone's 18th birthday. But i let it go and try not to think selfishly. 

Now it's the turn of the last friend, C, and we've been planning to make her a whole personalized card game (yes, it was about drinking, which i don't like at all, but i stuck to it since it was for my friend), so we had to order the cards, make up rules and decorate and write on them accordingly.
So E, S and me sat down and started thinking about the rules. 
S said she'd order the cards, but she ended up being disorganized and not ordering them, and if we bought them now they wouldn't come in time for the birthday, and even if they did we wouldn't have time to decorate them. 

Besides the cards they wanted to make her other 2-3 gifts: A tattoo coupon, a pair of Dr Martens, and one of those tiny heaters for wax. Of course those were way too many gifts for me to contribute, so i said no to two of them, willing to pay for the last one. 
However, S and E stuck to the card idea, and they came up with the idea of making all the cards on little paper cutouts and give them to C, and a few days later re-do all of them on the actual cards and give it to her. I replied that it would take a lot of time to do. 
E got mad at me and told me that if i didn't wanna work with them i could've just said so, and then told me that S and her would be working together without me. 

Now this thing really made me upset, i feel so disrespected, and even if it might seem selfish I'm pretty bummed out about the gemstones i got at my 18th bday, while they were getting nice gifts. 
I still haven't responded to the text message since last night, because i really don't wanna ruin the whole friendship just a few days before a birthday, but i really can't get over the fact they gave me something so effortless, and I'm very upset at E because this isn't the first time she showed me this temper. Now idk what to tell her, or what to think. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for being mad at my good friend for bringing his gf to a music festival when it was planned to be a boys weekend?

"title: AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering
content: Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?

&#x200B;

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

To maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks? [https://imgur.com/Zh8hBQ8](https://imgur.com/Zh8hBQ8)",nta
"title: AITA for being petty after giving my roommate 30-days notice to vacate for having a nasty bedroom?
content: TLDR; I invaded my roommate’s privacy before an inspection. After giving notice to vacate, I acted petty. (Both of us 30M)

I’d known him for 10 years. I lived with him & his ex-gf at his dad’s pad dirt-cheap in 2016. After college I wanted to live like a child again & I stayed there 1 year.

2021, he needed a place to live. I offer my spare room, under the conditions he pays rent on time & has a job.

November, I get a manic infatuation with him. I tell him, he accepts us dating, then abandons job to get unemployment. I give him December’s rent for Xmas hoping to get him on track. I notice he can’t seem to follow thru with his words.
March, still no job & rent is 3-4 weeks late & no physical spark. I end the dating on good terms. We hang out like normal for a while.

Mid April - he finally gets a job. I get a note from landlord about an inspection in 2 days.
The next day he says “The clothes are ok but I wouldn’t want them to see the trash.” I peaked in his room when he left for the first time in months.
It’s a dump. Reaks of mold. Dirty laundry, beer cans, takeout bags everywhere. Bathroom smells cigarettes (we got fined before for him smoking in the wrong area. Next strike, I get evicted.)
I text him it needs to be cleaned.
That night, he lies about having to stay 3 hours after his work is closed.  He throws out the trash but doesn’t clean the moldy toilet or laundry. Next morning, I wake him up before the inspection time to check… he replies to my criticism with things like “I don’t smell it,” “I haven’t seen bugs,” “I never leave the towels on the floor wet.” “[the landlords] have seen worse, the clothes are normal.” He is running late for work & leaves. I bag up his clothes and throw it in the corner so the room is OK for the landlords. The towels on bathroom floor are wet.
I change the Wi-Fi password. He hasn’t paid rent in 45 days at this point.
I text “this is your 30 days notice to vacate.” 
I text his dad pictures of the room. (His dad is his only other friend in town willing to give him any help.) his dad agrees with me & they’ll talk.

We don’t speak for the next 3 weeks. I ignore him when he leaves the house and says “going to work.”

He continues to drink my alcohol. I left a note on a bottle that says “I mark them, asshole.” I find it one morning on the counter, a shot taken out of that bottle. I text him to return the TV I let him borrow so I can sell it. & say I’ll change the locks if he tries squatting. He said he’d be out in 5 days. 

7 days later, he is moving the last stuff out. I ask “are you really not going to say anything?” He says “I have nothing to say”. 

He leaves a room with hair & multiple stains on the carpet, puke and beer drips on the walls, nasty shower, and a black toilet bowl.

I… I did a ton of really petty shit, absolutely. I just want him to be a normal functioning person from the bottom of my heart… I am at my wits end. I just wanted an apology or any recognition that he knows I feel disrespected. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for being petty naming my child?
content: I’ll try and keep this brief. I have 5 older siblings, one of my brothers died young in a motorcycle accident which completely devastated my family. I was close to my brother and when I was pregnant with my first child I wanted to name him after my brother. I ran the name by my family and one of my brothers (J) was against it saying he didn’t want someone else with my brother’s name in the family and would find it hard so I named my son something else because it seemed to really upset him. J then had his own son a few years later and named him after our deceased brother which did annoy me but I let it go as they were also close and a few years had passed. His son has the same full name as our brother and originally went by the same nickname but now gets called something slightly different.

Later, when I had my daughter I named her a family name. We sometimes call her a slightly unique nickname, “\[her name\]-Lu”, based on her middle name. One of my other brothers (P) then had a daughter a few months after mine and used the same name which seemed weird to me and I asked if they would consider something else as I thought it would be confusing but they refused so I dropped it. This felt strange and annoying and most of my family agreed but they wouldn’t change their minds. They gave their daughter a different but very similar middle name so also use the same nickname as well. I know I don’t have exclusive right to use the name but it’s confusing and they refuse any attempts to distinguish the girls which is irritating especially as they’re only 9 months apart so they’re close in age and they clearly already knew my daughter’s name before picking theirs. I honestly wish I had named my daughter something else. We all see each other a lot and usually all go to my parents once a week. The girls might also go to the same school though they would be different years.

J said it didn’t matter really because they have different last names and told me to get over it and kept saying I didn't control what names other people use which felt a bit hypocritical. I am now having another boy and I’m very tempted to just name him after my deceased brother, this was my original first choice and we’re struggling to find names we like. I already changed it once which I kind of regret now and we would use my brother’s nickname which my nephew doesn’t even go by. I’m also wondering why I’m going to such lengths to keep my family happy and since apparently it doesn’t matter, I just want to name my kids what I like. I’m also aware this is a little petty so AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for being polite to someone’s ex?
content: I (17f) recently went to a convention. The first two days I went and hung out with my friend who I will just call Hero (16f). 
While there, the first day we met a person named C(17nb). I previously knew Chase from a therapy group we did, and I do not mean to be rude, but Chase is extremely unstable, as they’ve said themselves. I wouldn’t consider them a friend as they never really talked to me.. The last day of the convention, Hero went to the con with someone I no longer consider a friend as they were showing extremely abusive behaviours towards only me. I respect the fact that Hero can have other friends, irrelevant to the story. As I didn’t hang out with Hero that day, I didn’t talk to her very much. 

I met a person who I do an extracurricular with, Ally(17nb), and had a friendly exchange as Ally offered to take pictures for a cosplay meetup as our cameraman was busy playing D&D. While doing this, Chase stood at the side for a bit until the pictures were finished. They whispered in my ear something about Ally being their ex. I didn’t process it right away as Chase walked away. I went up to Ally to check out the photos they had taken. Chase quickly stormed off and I hadn’t noticed until after. I thanked Ally for taking pictures, especially since it was almost 100 pictures. Later during a red carpet event for cosplayers, onstage, I did this time notice Chase change seats to move to a different side of the room as Ally moved to the middle to take a few more photos for us while we were on stage, this time with my phone because our cameraman had to leave.  

Two hours later I get a text from Hero saying that I made Chase cry because I was hanging out with their ex. I messaged Chase and apologized for making them upset and that I had honestly no idea until I was told, and that Ally had offered to take pictures. I received a reply in which they said they didn’t want to talk to me. I respected that and backed off. Hero is now extremely upset with me because I had made it worse by messaging Chase.  I told Hero that I had tried to apologize, but I don’t want to insert myself in someone else’s drama especially as I’m going through a tough time myself as my hamster who I had a very deep connection with had just passed that day due to cancer. (I am emotional when it comes to animals) 
Hero is now saying that I am an asshole. 

She barely knows Chase! The way it was worded exactly is “You were hanging out with Chase’s abuser, such an asshole move to keep talking to Ally. I CANT believe you.” I personally believe that being civil and respectful towards people is polite, especially not knowing both sides of the story. Other friends are now pointing out that I wasn’t rude or impolite even when Hero decided to hang out with someone I dislike, and that I was even civil and respectful towards that person in a brief interaction, and that I shouldn’t have to deal with any of this. I’m just so unsure and confused about the situation. I honestly just want someone’s unbiased opinion on this.",info
"title: AITA for being rude to a service worker?
content: 
I pay 1500 dollars for my schools meal plan, and they have this downstairs area that makes breakfast sandwiches on demand. They have this breakfast burrito that I like, but the last 10 times I went there they always forgot to put salsa in. The last 10 times I’d be real friendly, just say “hey can I get in the sandwich,” and then not complain when they didn’t put it in there. It’s a small thing but I’m paying 1500 bucks for this plan, and I feel like if I ask for salsa in it, which is absolutely allowed there’s no rule against it and they do it regularly, is that too much to ask for?

Anyway, today, I was stressed and just wanted my savory salsa-y breakfast burrito. But they’d screwed up the last 10 times, so I really condescendingly said “can I have it in the burrito. Not on the side. Not in the bag. Inside. The. Sandwich.” And one of the workers who always screwed up the order starts telling me that I’m being mad disrespectful (I was, I’m not gonna deny that) and he’s saying “there’s a nicer way to ask that,” and I just told him “the last 10 times I was sweet as honey and look what good that did me.” They mocked me openly behind my back while I filled up my coffee, yeah. But like come on. I was really nice all the other 10 times, and I was stressed. I apologized to them personally, because I understand there was probably a better way to handle that now that I’m seeing things clearly, but come on. I just want salsa in my burrito. I’ve avoided being rude to workers in my life and am usually pretty compassionate, but it was just this time I kinda snapped.
So lay it on me thick. AITA?

Edit: Sounds like I handled this really poorly. Thanks for all the clear advice",yta
"title: AITA for being rude to my SIL and only caring about my nephew
content: I’ve been feeling guilty about this and need outside perspective on the situation. My oldest brother started dating a girl awhile back and after they had been dating for awhile she confided in me that he had a dr*g addiction he has been dealing with for years. In the midst of all of this I suffered a MC early on and when my SIL confronted me about it her initial response was that she wanted a baby. My brother is in his 30s and has been adamant about never wanting children and said lifestyle isn’t suited for a child. I reiterated that to her and asked what his thoughts were and she brushed it off saying her biological clock was ticking and she “needed” a baby. I told her that a baby is the last thing they need right now and that it would jeopardize his health and could cause him to lose control. 

A few months later she was pregnant. Our family was worried about my brother but no one would speak up but me. I found out a while later that I was pregnant and I think this is where I get my concerns mixed up. My family was worried about their pregnancy because of my brother’s addiction so my pregnancy was completely brushed over. All we ever talked about was their pregnancy and my brothers even “joked” saying no one cared about mine. Looking at it I get that I am in a better position to have a child but it still hurt to feel like my baby didn’t matter at all. 

My relationship with my SIL completely changed and I felt so much anger towards her for continuing to try to have a child even when I warned her that it could negatively affect my brothers life. When my nephew was born I obviously adored him. He didn’t ask for this and I love him and will always love him no matter what. I recognize that I’m the person people talk about who don’t care about the mom and only the baby and part of me feels so guilty about that. But after the baby my brother has completely spiraled and it’s gotten so bad that he had to go to rehab (she gave him an ultimatum it wasn’t his choice to go). She has been playing the victim throughout this entire situation and while I do feel for her I told her this was going to happen. My mom has been helping her with so much and taking the baby for multiple days. 

My parents have been taking care of their expenses and taking care of her and she still plays the victim to outsiders that she’s doing everything herself. She’s not very grateful for their help and her actions have made me dislike her even more. I feel guilty because I don’t want my relationship with her to affect my relationship with my nephew but I genuinely feel like I hate her for putting my brother through this when he never wanted this. I may just be pregnant and hormonal and I may be a completely horrible person. If I am please tell me and I will actively try harder to forgive the situation. I just personally feel like she’s a very manipulative person and I’m the only one who can see what’s happening here.",nta
"title: AITA for being spoiled?
content: Im 13M in a family where I am constantly called spoiled in any argument we have. And I agree, I am spoiled! But I don't think its my fault. I was spoiled from a very young age(from birth), my dad got me everything I wanted(even though we are poor, my parents always complain about low money.) and when I wanted stuff from my mom, I would scream until she caved in.  Its important to note my dad is mentally abusive, he screams and yells in arguments and calls me a spoiled brat all the time. This all came with me as I came older. I didn't know what was right and what was wrong and I still have very hard times judging what Is right and wrong. My parents tell me im ""Old enough"" to figure it out by myself. I also have very great anger issues because of my dad, I told all of this information to my parents recently, and emphasizing how I didn't think it was my fault for being spoiled. My dad started cussing me out and they both told me it was my fault for being a spoiled brat. I don't know how to wash dishes, using a washing machine and I didn't take showers on my own for the longest time. I got so angry at this, because they always call my spoiled and a brat and lazy but I don't know what to do! I suggested family therapy but the ignored me saying it was my fault and I need to go to a mental hospital. My mom constantly calls me abusive because of the arguments I have with her, because I don't know if what I am saying is abusive or not. I need help, my family needs help but refuse to listen to me. AITA? If so, what can I do to improve? I really hate being spoiled and want to be better, but I don't know how.

"title: AITA for being upset about the way my boyfriend chews?
content: 
Background: I have misophonia. My biggest trigger being people that smack their mouth when they eat. It enrages me and I literally am unable to focus on anything else. 

My (29f) boyfriend (30m) have been dating for about 5 months (until recently we’ve been long distance). Something I learned quickly is that he smacks his lips when he eats - like a lot. I’ve mentioned it to him before and he tries to be mindful of it but old habits die hard I guess because nothing has changed. 

We were eating dinner together the other night and he was, per usual, smacking his lips. I turned the tv up to try and drown it out but it wasn’t working. I was about to go eat in another room to eat when he became conscious of my behavior (I was being quiet and not engaging with him). He told me, “you need to go to therapy for this. You’re making me really uncomfortable with how I eat now.” He then proceeded to tell me how I make the same sounds and then tried to record me eating to prove it to me. I told him recording me was not okay nor helpful.” He then got up, told me “you need to get help,” and went to go eat in another room.
I was pretty upset by his reaction and told him I needed space from him. 

AITA here for getting pissed at his reaction? 

Additional information: I’ve mentioned his chewing being an issue maybe 2 other times? And I’m as nice as I can be: “babe you’re chewing with your mouth open.”",yta
"title: AITA for being upset for my 7yr cousin getting all the attention and my family ignoring me?
content: Hi, the background to this story is that I (16f) have been part of community theatre production for 9 years (although productions were off for two years during the pandemic) our show is on for a week and the rehearsals last a few months before. The show happens once a year in the winter. I started in the children's cast, and moved to the adult cast in recent years (both casts are in the same show, the adults get the roles and the children are more ensemble based.) 

Okay, so, last year, my youngest cousin Lilly (female 7) joined the childrens cast. Due to being a dance captain,  I was at all the children's rehearsals too. Throughout the run up to the show, my Nana and Papa (who are involved in the backstage elements) always mentioned how Lilly was in the show, hardly ever mentioning me. I didn't mind this at first as I am very proud of Lilly but it started happening constantly. Lilly has always been the favourite grandchild too.

During the show week, I did Lilly's make up, helped with her costumes, sat with her backstage etc. Every show I had done in the past, my family always said ""break a leg/good luck"" before and praised me after the show. 
This didn't happen this time, none of my family wished me luck, and when the show was over, they would just talk about how well Lilly had done. 
After the first show, my Nana put a big gushy facebook post up about how amazing Lilly was in HER show etc. Honestly,  this kinda hurt me because I had worked so hard for this show, I learned every dance in the show (I was only in 2) so I could teach to the children, I helped make dance videos for the kids to practice at home and I made more than half the costumes in the show too, as well as having a lead role and pre-examinations in school.

I mentioned it to one of the other adult cast members and she was on my side of the whole thing and even bought me flowers to show that she was there and supported me. But my uncle thinks I'm overreacting and I shouldn't be jealous of my cousin as its not her fault and she's a child.
When I spoke to my mother, she said that my Nana probably didn't realise she hurt my feelings and that she would speak to her. 

At the next show, my Nana got a photo with me and Lilly and posted it saying that I was also in the show. But she still didn't say Good luck or well done.

On the last show night,  I had accidentally left my lucky charm at home. (a stuffed animal I've had for years and has gone to every big and stressful thing in my life with me) My Nana just laughed and said I should grow up. This really threw me off and i ended up making several mistakes throughout that show. 

To this day, (like 6 months later) my family haven't said well done, and continue calling the show that I've been apart of for 9 years ""Lillys show"" it's like I've been erased. 

So.. am i the a-hole?


Edit:
I'm not upset with Lilly, I am very proud of her, im annoyed at the fact my family ignored me. 
I also had a completely different role last year than I had previously,  I had a talking and acting role, as well as dancing.  I also played two separate characters. 
Also, i have struggled with public speaking my whole life so i did find that this was a big achievement for me.
They also took a ticket away from me that I had paid for to give to Lillys mother, instead of my friend going",yta
"title: AITA for being “too honest” about why I don’t drink?
content: I’m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. 
It was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife’s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I’ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. 

My flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, “Mark.” I’ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we’re “friendly” i honestly don’t know him that well. But you can tell he’s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.

Mark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. 

Mark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I’d politely decline. It’s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I’m either drinking a soda/water and it’s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me “princess”; I don’t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.

All my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he’d forget about me. But every now and then he’d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn’t want to drink. 

My wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I’d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he “understood now”. 

Mark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that’ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I’ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, “actually I don’t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.”

Wiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. 

Our flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn’t his fault he didn’t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he’s the only one right now that’s taking Mark’s side.

He said I could’ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. 

Now yes I could’ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that’s none of his business and a “no” should’ve been enough. 

I only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",nta
"title: AITA for betraying my sister's trust by selecting the colour for our new room?
content: My family will be moving in to our new home soon. I promised my (18f) sister(13f) that she can decorate and select the colour of our room as she wants. In my previous home we both kept our room as we liked but my parents let me paint it as I wanted. Obviously I painted with my sister's input but you could tell the room was exactly more of my style.

So my sister wanted the walls to be purple? I'm not sure but it was a shade of purple she wanted. But the day my dad asked for the final decision regarding the colour of room my sister was at school. I asked him to wait for her to come home but apparently it was urgent and he told me to either select or he will. I then selected a shade which was more like lavender but a bit more dark idk how to explain. My sister at that time assured me she liked it.

But today she decided to visit our home and saw the room and was really upset. The walls were not exactly the shade I selected. It was like a mix of lavender and pink according to her and it looked horrible. When she showed me I was shocked. It did look really weird. Both of us hate pink. She is blaming me now and says its my fault the room looks horrible and that I broke her trust when I promised she could do what she wanted.

My parents are like it's what you selected so don't come at us. I feel like I'm the asshole here because I won't be here in a few months but my sister will be for many more years. AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I went through all the comments and saw your suggestions. I have talked to my sister and she understands that it wasn't my fault. Although we can't repaint now we are looking into decorating it such that it looks a bit good. She liked the idea of peel off wallpaper as one of you suggested so we might go for it.",nta
"title: AITA for blaming my mom for spoiling my younger sister?
content: I (21f) have a younger sister (18f) (let's call her Amber) who has always been one of the troubled children in the household. Constantly getting kicked out of class, disrespecting everyone around her, even getting expelled TWICE, throwing tantrums when she didn't get her way, and even going as far as to threaten to hurt herself, etc. I know when she was around 6 she was there when our dad died. I understand how tough it was for her, but starting from age 7 up until age 12 she would throw tantrums and break stuff when something didn't go her way or she didn't get what she wanted. She would always tell our mom that she hated her and that ""she wishes daddy was here"". After 6 years of counseling, multiple trips to the ER as well as psych wards for children she hadn't changed. But I started to realize when she was around 11 that she would still do most of the stuff she did when she didn't get her way so that our mom would then cater to her every need. Our mom would give her money to get food while I sat in school and starved. When I was being bullied my mom told me to go tell my teachers. Like the teachers weren't watching me get bullied or they were bullying me themselves. 

Our mom took Amber to a movie theater for her birthday as well as an amusement park. None of my older siblings nor I ever got to do that. If you looked at our rooms ambers room looked absolutely gorgeous compared to mine. Beautiful lights, a tv, a fluffy rug, a new king-size mattress (when my mom bought that she didn't even have a bed yet), posters, and a decent-sized closet. It took me a year and a half to get 1 lamp for my room because she never had the time or money to go take me shopping (there are a lot of other things but I'd run out of space listing them all). Our mom could be dead dog tired and she would still take my sister out or buy her whatever she asked for. 

 I watched Amber for the past 7 to 9 years exploit our mom and she continues to do it till this day. When this was brought up to our mom last week she got mad at us(me and the 2 older siblings)  and said ""That's not true, yall were spoiled too especially you op"", ""Your grandparents gave you a room full of toys"". I told her it was not my fault that I looked like their dead child (they had a child around 6 that died a very tragic death and as a kid, I looked a lot like her). I also stated that Amber has also contributed to our mom's health declining. She chalked it up to just her getting old... SHE'S ONLY 52!! I told her it was her fault that Amber acts the way she does. That's why no one likes being around Amber and why no one believes a word that comes out of her mouth. I told our mom that she raised a brat and a two-faced daughter. After that, I left and just walked around town. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam?
content: 

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.",nta
"title: AITA for bothering my mom?
content: I (15F) is the result of an accidental pregnancy, my mom (55F) gave birth to me when she was 40 which is not the ideal age, the doctor already told her that I would most likely be susceptible to illnesses and would have a high chances of being mentally retard ( I’m not btw)

Growing up, I was not a sick child mostly because I avoided things that I deemed unclean like mud, insect, sick peoples ( don’t worry I did grow out of it). But this still doesn’t mean that I in as good of a shape as a average child. When I started school, I was definitely in the nurse office more than the others. The average kid in my school get send home like at most 2 times a year, while I got send home 4 times/year. I understand that this is an inconvenience to my parents.

This trend of me being send home didn’t end when i started middle school. My mom was called just a few days ago to pick me up cause I have a painful stomachache. She took me to the hospital, they ran some test give me my prescription and I could get rid of that awful stomachache. However the ultrasound result showed no sign of anything wrong with me (Idk how this work, if anyone know pls tell). My mom was pissed. Yesterday, i got around 3 hours of sleep because I need to finish my schoolwork before being able to rest properly. This as a result make me extremely tired and i fell like i could just fal unconscious at any moment. I tried some coffee to see if i would help and it didn’t. So the break rolls around and i was beyond tired. I reluctantly went to the nurse. The nurse gave me some meds to help with the headache and nausea but I was still feeling terrible. So she told me to call my mom to let her know to come pick me up. I tried telling her that it’s a bad idea, that my mom would  most likely yell at me and I tried convincing her to just let me stay ‘till school is over. But apparently that she is not allowed to do so so I gave in and called my mom. Before she even arrived, she yelled at me over the phone and when she finally got there she started yelling even more. On the way home, we got in to and argument. I won’t go into details but it essentially is just her telling me if i don’t want to go to school anymore I should just tell her and about how when she is my age she didn’t bother other like me and I’m just seeking attention. She told me that she doesn’t bother me when is sick then why am I bothering her with this. She said that she do everything alone then why can’t I ( In my defense, I’m not old enough to drive to seek medical attention like she can yet). She used some hurtful words and it honestly make me cry. I know parenting is hard and she is trying but I don’t think that I should be treated like this just because of a problem I can’t fix. She is threatening to put cameras in my rooms when i’m gone now  and I do not consent to this, I feel like my personal boundaries should be respect and she don’t have the right to do this to me.

"title: AITA for breaking my husband's family heirloom?
content: I (21f) recently got into a fight with my (25m) husband, for breaking his family heirloom that was a big crystal vase that contained 1 flower from every wedding on his family's side from the bride's bouquet.

We met 5 years ago when he pulled me away from oncoming traffic, my parents had recently divorced and I had been trying to navigate my life and he came at just the right moment. 

5 years later and today we are happily married with 2 dogs. 

Well, a few days ago our dogs went out of our house because I forgot to close the door while putting away a bunch of groceries. I thought my dogs had run out to the backyard to play so I closed the door and locked it, I then went to my bedroom to take a nap before starting dinner. A few hours later my husband comes home yelling at me that the neighbors called and told me I forgot the dogs outside and our neighbors had been keeping an eye on them while I was napping. And when he came in telling me this, he opened the door too hard and made the vase that was on top of a mantel fall, and I'm quite short so the vase fell on me as I was trying to calm him down and apologize. Our dogs started barking and I told him to get them away so they wouldn't step on the glass, He then started shouting at me for breaking his family heirloom that we both loved very much. As I'm writing this I am still grieving the loss of it. 

After a short while of him and me arguing back and forth, he told me he needed to cool down and walked out on me to stay at the neighbour's house. 

He hasn't texted me since, and I'm really worried. I really love him and he makes me so happy he's the first and only relationship I've had and I don't want to lose him. 

So should I apologize for breaking the vase?

"title: AITA for breaking my promise to my stepkids, and ""abandoning and traumatizing"" them because I did not want to parent them anymore?
content: I met ""Will"" when I was 22. Will was 29, with 2 kids, and had newly been widowed. We had whirlwind courtship where he introduced me to the kids and got me involved in their lives VERY early (first few days after I met him.) Will said really quickly he was sure I was ""the one,"" not only for himself but also for his kids. That we'd have an incredible, happy family life. We got married when I was 23, Will was 30, and his kids were 8 and 6. Our wedding ceremony also included me and the kids making promises to each other, which was Will's idea. 

Soon Will shoved ALL the childcare onto me. I wasn't a stay at home spouse, I worked full time and always have. But he always had ""reasons"" for me to do the childcare - him being sore from doing a physical job, me being ""better"" at it since I babysat kids this age in the past and he never had. Or ""girl stuff"" for his daughter. Or cooking or anything. He always had some reason and it ended up always on me. 

He started playing video games and ""relaxing"" from getting home until bed, because he was ""tired"" and he was ""bringing in the money and keeping the roof over everyone's heads,"" though that wasn't really true. He said he DESERVED to relax. Then he went out with his friends or brought them back to drink beer and watch loud TV. 

He developed a major attitude with me, and encouraged same in the kids. They found it funny. He started openly disrespecting me and encouraged them to also. He was the ultimate ""fun dad"" and I got put in the role of the mean witch. Sometimes they all ganged up on me and mocked me. But also all expected me to serve them and constantly be jumping up to care for them.

By the end of the first year I realized the marriage was a big mistake, but felt guilty leaving because of my promises to the kids. Another year went by and I realized that no matter how I tried, and how I knew they were only kids and I didn't really blame them, I genuinely hated both of the kids. And I could not lie to myself any more and pretend that I loved them. I did not, and I never would. One day I just walked out, packed up everything of mine and moved out while nobody was at home. I left a note explaining it wasn't working and saying goodbye. That was the end. 

Cue shitstorm from my ex and a bitter divorce, but we both walked away with what we went into the marriage with (not much for either of us). I had never legally adopted the kids so I had no rights or responsibilies about them and I never reached out to any of them again. Honestly I was overjoyed to be rid of all of them.

15 years have gone by and that seems like a lifetime ago, or another person's life, but I'm still in my 30's. I was recently shocked to get a message from Tamara, Will's daughter, now 25. Tamara said I betrayed and traumatized her for life for ""abandoning them"" after my promises to them. She said I had a ""responsibility to never leave no matter what."" I know she remembers the horrible way she treated me though.",nta

So, they called my parents to tell them about the emergency, and then called me. They asked if I could come into their house, take care of their baby, until they came back, and I was down with that. I’ve taken care of babies before, so, this wasn’t new to me.

Took my stuff, and drove to their house, stayed with my cousin. Now, by the time my morning class comes about, my aunt and uncle haven’t shown up yet, which was within expected (they told me they’ll be back by one-two PM), and I had my baby cousin in my lap, setting up laptop for my morning class, and my cousin falls asleep, and I’m like OK. I can deal with this. A sleeping baby is the best kind of baby. Do not move them. 

Now, here’s the problem. I had a presentation to do, and so my video is off, as I’m preparing to give it, and the professor goes “OP, please turn on your camera.”

“Uhh. I have a sleeping baby right now, so… is that okay with you?”

“A sleeping baby?”

“Yeah, there was a family emergency, so my cousin’s asleep on me right now, um… I don’t want to say the details in class, but I can email you after class, and supply any proof you need.”

“It’s fine, please turn on your camera.”

So I do, and my cousin is asleep, and I give the entire presentation, and I’m really proud of how it went, because I think I did really well, and I answer all questions, and my cousin doesn’t wake up! Like this is the best case scenario.


Well, last night, I got my grade for the powerpoint, along with an email from the professor that says she marked me down because she felt the baby was there as a pity prop, and I was attempting to gain sympathy, and if I hadn’t had the baby, I would’ve gotten higher.


So was I the asshole for showing up with a baby? I didn’t think about the pity aspect.

edit :- sorry for the sporadic replies. i am still a university student balancing my shit. few clarifications. Yes, I did send her the proof she would’ve required to see there was an emergency. Yes, I will be reporting - and updating. Yes, there are better ways I could’ve done this, but a stressed and sleep deprived student isn’t normally the best source of judgement. The class was a philosophy one.",nta
"title: AITA for bringing up my brother's ""premature"" birth at Christmas dinner to get my parents to shut up?
content: I am a nurse practitioner and I am the primary care provider for a lot of the low risk maternity cases at the practice where I work.  I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. 

My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  

I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  

So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  

My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  

So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.

"title: AITA for buying lower grade steaks when my in-laws visit and serving my mom and dad Wagyu.
content: My wife and I live far away from both of our sets of parents.  We visit them a couple of times a year and they visit us about the same.  

My mom and dad love food. They will buy pounds of garlic and leave it in a rice maker for a month to make black garlic. They plan their vacations around amazing restaurants. 

My in-laws are lovely people but boiling chicken drumsticks is fancy for them. And they refuse to eat steak that isn't well done. 

I discovered this the first time I went to their home for dinner. I wasn't even asked how I like my steak. Everyone got a well done steak. 

It took me years to convince my wife to try a medium rare steak. Now she loves them. 

I bought some beautiful prime steak for them when they came over when we moved in together. I made theirs medium well, and I died a little inside.  Her dad took it back to the grill and destroyed them. So now I buy Select grade meat. 

I've been buying some excellent quality Wagyu for when my parents visit. Not every single time. Maybe once a year.  

My wife says I'm being an asshole by not treating both families the same. 

I don't think I should waste money on great food for them when I know how they will treat it.",info
"title: AITA for buying my own groceries for work while living at my parents but not letting anyone else have some?
content: I (F19) still live at home, however I am currently looking for an apartment to move out. I work full time and I’m a full time student. I basically support myself, my parents don’t pay for my food or schooling etc. really the only thing is I still live at home under their roof. 

I recently bought myself a small amount of groceries meant to bring to work with me for my lunches so I could save money and not spend money on lunch everyday. When I brought the groceries home and was putting them in a space for me, my sister (F13) saw something I got and asked if she could have some. I told her no, these are for my work lunches not for snacking. She then continued pestering me about and went and complained to my mother about it, in which she called me greedy. I then explained to both of them that I bought these so I would have food for my lunches at work and was hoping they would last me at least two weeks.
A little backstory as to why I don’t really want anyone else eating my groceries; the last time I bought myself groceries for work, they were gone in about a day or two because my sister and dad ate them. 

AITA?

Edit: Because of full time school and work, I am not home during the day, I come home about 10 at night every day so I do not eat anything my parents have bought, except for water bottles.  I come home around 10-10:30, get a shower and then go to bed, and then get up at 6:45 for work and school is after work and it repeats everyday, just for a little background just in case :)",nta
"title: AITA for calling a person “man”?
content: 
Hi, I am a foreigner visiting the US. This took place in a fast food chain in the southeast. After being handed my order I said “thanks man!” and proceeded to eat it. I decided to go for dessert and when that was being handed to me the person at the counter said “before you called me a man, I am not a ‘man’, I am a ‘sir’”. Due to my accent and the phrasing I assumed the person had mistakenly heard “ma’am”. I told them that I said “m-a-n” but they just kept repeating that they “were no man, but a ‘sir’”. I just apologized and left. The person didn’t say it in a nice way but rather  very assertively and it made me very uncomfortable. The person was black and I know the implications of calling people “boy”, “uncle”, etc but never heard of “man” being pejorative aside from a gender issue (which doesn’t make sense as they wanted to be called by “sir”).

"title: AITA for calling my boyfriend’s mom’s best friend (local doctor where I live) for urgent pregnancy advice?
content: I (27f) found out I am pregnant via at home tests late on Thursday afternoon. I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. 

I am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. 

On Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). 

For quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.

So, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.

I explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. 

She told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. 

Fast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:

“I feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.

X (boyfriend’s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn’t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that— an act. 

What I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X’s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I’m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.”

While calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I’ve sat on the text message, the more I’ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that’s irrelevant here.

On the other hand, I can’t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. 

AITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn’t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?

Clarification edit: our phone call was at 5pm, not 12am. 12am was when I received the text message 3 nights later.",info
"title: AITA for calling my dads girlfriends house ‘dads house’
content: I (23f) recently stayed at my dad (60s) and his long term girlfriends (50s) new home, where my step sister (19f) lives too. It’s really important that I mention here that my dad doesn’t own the house, his girlfriend does, but my dad pays half the bills, is paying for renovations and it’s his registered address. 

I stayed over for a long weekend, and this was my second visit since they moved in over Christmas. I live 70 miles away in my dads old house where we had lived as a two since 2014 with my boyfriend which we bought off him before this move. 

My mum and dad divorced when I was very young, nothing traumatic but this of course still comes with the baggage. I don’t have a particularly close bond with my mum, I consider my dad my main single parent. My dad has been with his girlfriend for upwards of 15 years. 

I generally really like her, we are on very good terms with each other, and beside the odd weird comment we don’t tend to ever have any issues. Likewise, my little sister is great. 

My dad over the years of me growing up spent most weekends at her old house, which I would sometimes go as well and stay in the box room but as I got older this died down. Eventually my boyfriend moved into our house with my dad and my dad would stay at his girlfriends for weeks at a time. 

Back to the present, I had a very lovely trip at the new house this weekend as we had so much fun and I was really enjoying the feeling of being in a family home. 

I took a picture of the house and posted it on my social media on the last night saying I had a great weekend at my dads house. To my surprised, that evening I received a passive aggressive text message from his girlfriend in another room which went along the lines of ‘I’m glad you like my house. This is my house which I’m lucky to own. See you again soon good night’ 

I had a huge panic attack and replied that I was sorry and only captioned it that way as to not upset my mum, and that I loved her house and was grateful to stay there. This is partly a lie, I mainly called it that without thinking as I was just so happy to be with my dad. 

This upset me as I’m already quite insecure about this. I didn’t go on the house viewings with the three of them, I don’t have my own room like my sister and instead sleep in a generic spare bedroom, I barely spend any time there and there’s minimal evidence of me in the house. 

I feel really sad as I felt like I was included over this weekend and that I had somewhere to call a family home, and my caption on social media honestly was written in 10 seconds and I didn’t put any deep thought into it. I know it’s not my dads and I know I’m a guest. I feel really unwelcome at the house now and cried all the way home. 

I’m worried that IATA and it’s ok if I am. I’ve already deleted the post and gone home as planned. 

To note: I am neurodivergent & sorry if this is boring.",nta
"title: AITA for calling my daughters mother a terrible mother
content: I(30) live with my youngest sister (Violet11F), girlfriend (Evie30F), and my daughter (Vladimira11F). I have a majority of 75% custody of my daughter, her mother (Chelsea33) has the other 25%. I also have full custody of my sister, but that doesn't matter. Vladimira hates spending time with her annoying bio mother and has always seen my girlfriend as her mother.(In her own words) She even begs not to go at the end of every month as her mother forces her to be her family's personal maid. Makes her do too many chores and miss her tutor lessons. (Tutor lessons is the only time she gets to see violet besides school )And still expects her to act grateful after all the labour.

Long story short, they had a fight last week and vladimira shouted she can't wait to attend boarding school and never see her again. Chelsea yelled in her face that she never going and needs to forget about bit. Just to make this clear I promised to send my daughter to boarding school and the courts allowed it. This is when I told Chelsa that her daughter hates her and she's a shit excuse of a mother. Another fight started between Chelsa, Evie and I. It ended up Chelsa crying and accusing me of manipulating vladimira with money. ( Chelsea is no means starving but still suffering with the living crisis). But we only replied with her money issues are her own fault.

Honestly, this is year is the last year of primary school and her sats exams. ( for vladimira) I just want her to enjoy it and pass with flying colours. The only thing  preventing this is her bio mother stressing her out. AITA or not",yta
"title: AITA for calling my friend a pick me?
content: I (20F) am friends with Anna (21F). We’ve been close since 9th grade and have always been friends since then. Anna and I are book nerds, at least Anna used to be. We bonded over several of our favorite authors and libraries were our hangouts. Anna became less and less into books when she started dating her current boyfriend. They’ve been together for 2 years and I’m happy for them but I’m also wary of him sometimes.

Anna is a gamer now because of her bf. He introduced her to Overwatch and she got addicted for weeks, then they tried playing other games like Fortnite, Valorant, Nintendo games, you know all those. Which is fine but then Anna started getting into the frankly misogynistic “gamer girl” aesthetic.

She sent me pictures of her gaming PC that she entirely built herself and just spent money on expensive figures and decorations for it. It’s also all pink. She bought pink mice and now has a collection of pink keyboards. She also changed her avatars on Discord to anime or video game avatars. She seems really into the aesthetic of girls who are pressured into a super feminine role as a gamer.

I started wondering if her bf is pressuring her into that role, so I reached out and let her know that it’s okay to still love books and you don’t have to be those gamer girls who are just obsessed with pink. She said that she just has new hobbies right now but she still loves books and she doesn’t mind hanging out with me. I told her I’m sad she doesn’t hang out anymore because it feels like her bf is just forcing her to play games.

She got really defensive and said her bf has helped her get really good at games and build her gaming aesthetic. Tho tbh I don’t get those gaming aesthetics where you spend $1000 on decorations, posters, and a parts inside of a PC that you’re never going to even use. I said that it feels like she’s contributing to a misogynistic image of female gamers and it feels pick-meish.

She responded by calling me a judgemental asshole and that she can invest in any hobby she wants. Am I really the asshole? She was never super into pink or interacting with guy gamers online in Discord 24/7 so it comes off as pick-me to me.",yta

"title: AITA for calling my mom when my husband refused to listen to me?
content: I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.

The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week. 

When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. 
I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it ""wasn't that bad"". My reply was ""fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up."" Completly exhausted
I fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.

The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  

When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.

That lead to a fight where I told him. ""I am too sick to have company and they need to leave"".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.

My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. ""Since your family can stay so can we."" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.

I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.

Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.
My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.

My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.

SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. 
Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight. 

My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.
Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.

Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.
Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.
Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. 
He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. 
He begged me for another chance. 
The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita.
 We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.

Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",nta
"title: AITA for calling out a secretary and threatening to report her to her manager after she revealed health information?
content: I got a needle stick injury at work (Im a healthcare worker) and my family doctor filled out a lab requisition for baseline bloodwork to be done. One of the tests is HIV.

I went to an external lab to get it done because my family MD office is closed. It’s a typical diagnostics lab. In the waiting area there are 5 other people sitting down.

I go to the secretary and hand her the req forms. She takes them, checks me in, and I sit down.

After 10 minutes she calls me back calling out my first name and says, “Ma’am there’s an issue with the HIV test form.”

EVERYBODY in the waiting area heard and gave me looks. I go up to her, very angry, I told her you cannot just announce people’s personal health information like that.

She says, “Oh its ok, you are getting tested just because of a workplace injury.” I told her that’s fine, but other people don’t know that. What if I had to get tested for HIV for a more personal reason? What if somebody who knew me was in the waiting area and heard I was getting tested? 

She apologized but I told her I will be calling her manager and informing them of the incident. She rolled her eyes and said “Go ahead.” in a mocking tone.

I told my husband what happened and he said maybe I should cut her some slack. But I told him, revealing personal health information is a huge violation. Its something that was drilled into me as a healthcare worker. I am appalled that the secretary was so blasé about it. I don’t care if she gets reprimanded or loses her job, this is not something to mess around with.

"title: AITA for calling out my MIL's and my mother's hypocrisy?
content: I (27f) am engaged to my fiancé (27m) and our moms have been friends for many years, way before we got together.

Now for a little context and back story which matters on why I called them hypocrites.

I am autistic and suffer from multiple mental and physical health problems. Due to these issues I wasn't able to land a job until I was 24 and up until then my parents provided for me with no complaint.

My fiancé has a brother who's also on the spectrum and on a heavier scale than me. He's functioning but on occasions he has some outbursts and episodes which have cost him his career. So my in laws try to help him out as much as well and be supportive.

I've always felt guilty about my parents having to provide for me until I turned 24 but they assured me they do it because that's what loving and supportive parents do.

Here comes the hypocrisy part. Mil always judged my mom for providing for me until I was too old and said I'm too lazy to work and my mom is an idiot for still financially helping me. And my mom also judges my MIL for how she still ""babies"" her grown son instead of him just getting any regular job. Both my mom and mil call me and my brother in law pretentious for wanting to work on the field we studied in and got a degree for and call us lazy and ungrateful for picking and choosing what job to do. My MIL says it for me and my mom for my BIL. But of course each mom defends her own child when the other criticises.

I had enough of their bickering because in order to one up each other they always got us in the middle of arguments and putting us in awkward positions. So I called out their hypocrisy of how they can't critisise each other because at the end of the day they both did the same thing for their kids. I told my mom that if my MIL is a fool for providing whatever she can for her son then she's also a fool for providing for me and vice versa.

This ended up with both of them getting mad at me for pointing out their hypocrisy and my dad also called me ungrateful for using the help they provided for me against them to prove a point. This is really not what I was trying to do. I was just trying to get them to realise how silly their bickering is.",nta
"title: AITA for calling out my friend's questionable behavior
content: I(F29) have a been friends with a guy(M30) for a while. We were never the closest people but recently got very close while playing video games. He had told me about another girl that he has been playing games with for a while now(~4 years). Recently, he confided in me that she is 19 years old and quick math made me realize he has been playing with her since she was 15. He also said that he once took her somewhere she needed to go to give her company. He's called the girl hot/sexy a lot in the past. But he swore that their friendship is not sexual and him calling the girl hot is just him making an observation. The girl is going through problems at home and he just helps her. I believed him when he said this and at that time it seemed genuine as well but it still bothered me that he befriended a teenager online and I told him so that's its still borderline weird even if he claims his intentions are pure. I did consider forcing him stop but I was conflicted since I wasn't sure how it would affect the girl. He made it seem like he was her only support system. This guy has always liked younger celebrities too (nobody underage) but 18/19 yr olds and I have always called him out on it but i assumed it was just celeb crushes. He has also been in a lot of relationships but I always assumed that they were between consensual adults so I didn't think much of it. But, recently I came to know that one of the girls he slept with was actually 19 when it happened (he was 25) and he had also known her since she was 16 as well. This was the last straw for me since the whole thing was already bothering me and after so many instances of seeing this it felt like a pattern. I flipped at him. I called him a groomer and told him that he's just grooming girls. I was worried that the same thing would happen to the current girl as well.  I should add that although he's a great guy, he can get controlling and make people do things his way. Its not anything major but it's small things like the way you eat, what you eat, what you do when you hang out. 

 
He is obviously not talking to me anymore and I'm honestly good with that since the whole thing stressed me out. But I want to know if I did the right thing in calling him out or was I just an asshole who jumped to conclusions because of his past behaviors.",nta
"title: AITA for calling out my teammate in front of the team for having a poor attitude?
content: Last Saturday, I (M16), had a soccer match that was out of our county. My team is U17, and I am the captain for it.

I play center back (defender) along with my teammate Ethan, the co-captain who is a solid defender and typically has a “let’s bounce back” type of mindset when things don’t go his way, and he’s sometimes defensive when he makes an error.

About 15 minutes before halftime, it was still 0-0. It was our goal kick and I normally take them. Sometimes Ethan and I alternate in who takes them, but I take most of them. 

I let Ethan take the goal kick, and it barely comes off the ground and goes right to their striker, who I sprinted to and defended. But he passed it back to his midfielder, and hit it first-time and it went in. 

I was incredibly annoyed at this, and Ethan looked distraught. As soon as we kicked off, Ethan started moping and pouting, and it was obvious he was not putting in his maximum effort. I had to pick up his slack, and it pissed me off that he seemed to give up after making one mistake, which I thought was a joke because I'm not one to have this pessimistic mindset and give up whenever something goes wrong.

At halftime, Ethan started kicking our guys water bottles and started swearing, and I told Ethan he couldn't disintegrate after making one mistake and to stop moping (in front of the team), to which he told me to stfu and that he wasn't moping. 

During the second half, he played a lot more fierce and determined, and I feel like me calling him out motivated him to prove me wrong, and he wasn't moping anymore,

Sadly we lost 0-1  but we ended up playing very well towards the end. I was still frustrated with the whole match, and I vented this to our goalkeeper, saying that it was such a dumb goal to concede and the refereeing was awful. Our goalie understood and acknowledged Ethan’s improved performance in the second half, and he was also disappointed to have not gotten the win. 

After the final whistle, I was also feeling a bit guilty about having called Ethan out in front of the team. I apologized to him and he said it was all good, and he said “my bad for the goal kick, that won't happen again”. 

I thought we were good after that, but two of my other teammates came up to me after the game and told me that what I did t Ethan at halftime was pretty fucked and need to learn how to control my anger. One of them also said that I have a power trip from being captain, and it doesn’t give me the right to embarrass my other teammates and yell at people when I want. This confused me because I don’t make a big deal about being captain, and I don’t yell at my teammates just to be an asshole.

 I think that the teammates who are against me here just think this because they never communicate in games, and I never hear their voices on the field.

Am I the asshole here? I feel like what I did to Ethan might have been a little harsh in the moment, but it helped him pick himself back up and I apologized.",yta
"title: AITA for calling out step-family’s dirty laundry at Thanksgiving after they criticized me for being unmarried?
content: I’m still getting shit for this from my family so it’s possible I may be a bit of the AH here.

I’m 29F, the players are my mom, step-dad, and four step-siblings (35M, 37M, 40F, 42M) and their families.  I’m the black sheep in that I’m the only one not married with kids, but that’s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don’t want kids, and having a partner just isn’t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I’m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been “ew, never”.

I was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I’m not anxious to have kids since I’m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said “Nah, I’m good.”  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn’t appreciate. I said let’s move on, but my mom said “We’re just worried about you.”

This is where I’m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, “Well, I’m the only person at this table that’s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I’m not the one to worry about.”

And that’s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.

I feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.",info
"title: AITA for calling the ambulance after my mom and my nephews mom (who i was left alon with) wouldn’t answer the phone
content: It was really late and i had already told my mom i could watch him while she went out. I went to sleep after my nephew did but i woke up to an unbearable pain in my belly i had tried to ignore and took 2 pain pills but they weren’t helping so i called my mom she answered and told me to take a pain pill and lay down.


 I tried that and it didn’t help i tried calling her again and again but she didn’t answer and the pain was getting worse it literally felt like something was trying to rip itself out of my stomach, i could barley breathe and i was scared if i went to sleep I wouldn’t wake up. 


So i called the ambulance and when they arrived they were gonna leave a cop with my nephew, but the other guy said we were just gonna take him with us. Even they tried calling my mom and my nephews mom. They gave me some pills to help the pain which helped a lot and the nurses loved my nephew it was about 5 am at the time so they offered to watch him while i slept. 


I woke up to my mom calling me about how she hated me and how dumb i was she showed up to the hospital drunk and cps got involved and the nurses told them i said i was scared of my mom. My dad’s friend came and sat with me and told me my dad was on the way she left to go see my dad when he came and thats when i got a call from my nephews mom. 

Absolutely nobody liked her but we had to be nice to her cause my mom was scared of her making us never see king again. She called me telling my how stupid i was and yadayada we argued over text and she was really just telling me its my fault. 


I was really happy to hear it was only a really bad cramp my period had lasted for 3 weeks and me and my mom think its the birth control. Im 16 this 20 yo woman went to her house to talk shit about me and telling everyone i tried to make her lose my nephew whose life she was barely in.  


And was out 24/7 with a guy getting money she spent on herself leaving her granpa and siblings to watch after him she hits him when he cries and really just sucks shes best friends with someone who actually tried to get him taken away but forced her siblings to stop talking to me i found out she was talking because im friends with a brother of hers that despises her. I got kicked out and my moms forever mad at me. My dad, aunt and uncle asked why i just didn’t call them i said i didnt know. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for calling the police on my boyfriend's family?
content: Last year I moved in with my bf and his dad. My bf and I were in a long distance relationship for a few years and I moved across the country to be with him after I finished graduate school. Due to such a large distance I opted to sell my car and buy a new one after moving. When I did this my boyfriend helped me out by loaning me some money to help pay the down payment but I have since payed him back.

Last week my bfs older sister who lives in another state came to visit and stayed in the house with us. This was my first time meeting her and I thought she was very nice, but I didn't get to know her well. Two days ago my bf and I were out running errands together and his sister called him to ask when he would be back so she could borrow his car to go hangout with her friends in a town about an hour away. He told her it would be a while and she then asked if it was okay to borrow my car. My boyfriend asked me and I told him I was not comfortable with that and to tell her no. My boyfriend did tell her no, I heard the entire conversation.

Well a few hours later my boyfriend and I got home and my car was gone. I was shocked and my boyfriend was confused. When we went into the house his dad informed us that he gave my bfs sister the spare key to my car that was in the lockbox because she said she needed to go somewhere. My boyfriend told him that she asked to drive my car and that we had told her no so he didn't understand why she was allowed to take it and his dad said that since my bf helped pay for the car that it therefore was partly his, which meant his sister had the right to drive it as well. I was absolutely livid and I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like this. My name is the only one on the title, insurance, etc. as I am the SOLE owner.

My bf told his dad to call her and tell her to bring my car back immediately and she said she would ""be home soon."" Well after two hours I called the police and reported my car stolen because I was worried that if it got damaged or something then I would be forced to pay the repairs even though it wasn't my fault. My bf's dad and sister were pissed about this and they accused me of trying to get them arrested. They are now demanding that I apologize to them and tell the police it was all a misunderstanding but I really don't want to because I feel that they've tried to take advantage of me. My boyfriend agrees with me but he even said he thinks calling the police to report the car stolen may have been too far. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for calling the tow truck on them?
content: Hi,

I live in a small community with two rows of houses opposite one another with a small main driveway. It is impossible to be able to park in front of your garage without inconveniencing the opposite neighbor while they try to enter or exit their garage. Due to this fact, it is actually forbidden by HOA to park in the main driveway even in front of your own garage.  We recently got a new front neighbor and she has been doing a lot of construction requiring a van to be in front of her garage for almost the entire day. This makes it really hard for us to get in and out of our own garage. I have communicated with her and the workers about it multiple times and nothing has changed. I just don’t understand why the neighbor cant see how inconsiderate she’s being. Today I got fed up and called the towing company. The worker was outside when the tow truck came so they didn’t actually tow the van and I don’t know the conversation that occurred. However the worker flicked off the camera I have on top of my garage and called us “b*”. I honestly don’t even know if they’ll stop parking illegally and HOA is of no help. AITA? I don’t know what to do if they become hostile.",yta
"title: AITA for canceling a mother's day trip with my mom?
content: Many months ago, my mom (59F) suggested my husband & I (31F) meet up with her & my dad for a weekend getaway in the spring.  We both live in the same state, but they live 5 hours south of us, so get togethers are a little tricky sometimes.  We all moved to this state about 8 months ago after living very far from each other during the pandemic, at which time my husband & i lived only 15 mins from his immediate family & my parents were basically isolated. Now, we live close-ish to my parents and are on the opposite side of the country from his family. A big change. We agreed to the trip and she picked a weekend in May (many months away at the time) &, once we'd all booked our rooms, noted how it was a happy accident the trip was scheduled for mothers day weekend.

Fast forward a few months & I have had to travel or host visitors at least one week per month since our move and my husband has either done these things with me or watched our pets for us while I was away.  2 were for things relating to his family and the rest (at least 6 major events) were on my side - the majority of which dealing the fading health, eventual death, and memorial of my mom's father (my grandfather). He passed in January. My mom did not have a good relationship with him & her feelings about losing him are complicated. 

Another thing to know is my mom's brother is getting married in June & we (whole immediate family) are all planning to go. My mom's birthday (60th!) Is in July. For various reasons, my siblings & I were planning a celebration for my mom during the wedding trip since that was the way that made the most sense for us to be together to celebrate  since we are all broke from all this travel & also all have limited PTO, Except my parents who are retired and decently well-off

Now: After traveling with & then hosting his parents for the past 2 weeks, my husband & I are exhausted physically, emotionally, & socially. The idea of this trip was too much. My parents called a few days ago to express their own concerns about the trip since the park we were planning to visit is still covered in snow & the roads to get there require tire chains (which we don't have, but they just bought for themselves). My husband & I decided not to go.

Well, us canceling this mother's day trip triggered a whole slew of terrible-ness & now my mom feels like we care about everyone else more than her because ""she is NEVER the priority & all these other family members get celebrated & she gets forgotten."" She's extremely lonely in their new town; she's worried because women tend to die young in our family, so this birthday is a big deal to her; and (news to me yesterday) her best friend died a few weeks ago and she was hoping to have a heart to heart with me on the trip. She feels so unloved and I don't know what to do. It seems so uncaring to cancel on mothers day when she feels so bad, but we are also at our limit. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for canceling the family trip because my stepson damaged my plants?
content: 


I grow indoor plants and keep them around the house whether by the kitchen window or out on the front porch. I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting.

I have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house.

Later in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se.

Sean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.",nta
"title: AITA for cancelling a vacation because my wife can't pay her share after helping her adult son and ex-husband?
content: My wife(44F) makes quite a bit less than me(45M) so our joint expenses are split 70/30. For the most part things like vacations and where we bought a house are decided based on what she can afford, but there have been several times I've paid in full for vacations to places I really enjoy and wanted to share the experience with her.

She has a 23y/o son from her previous marriage. When she and I got together I told her I wouldn't mind paying extra for things here and there until her son was 18 and working or in school so she could take care of him. For the majority of our relationship, he has lived with his father. He decided against college or trade school and hasn't expressed any interest in starting to figure out a plan for the immediate future let alone his life. He floats from job to job, and his father is pretty much the same since the kid graduated. Therein lies the problem: every few months they'll call her for a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred there, 20 bucks this week, 80 the next. Sometimes it's her son calling for help, sometimes it's her ex-husband. This has caused her to be short on funds for our plans, or things she volunteered to cover on more than one occasion. Her reasoning when its her ex asking is that since their son still lives with him, she has to help him. I get that to a point.

We were supposed to go on a vacation later this month. Nothing major or fancy but just time away. We had agreed to split the cost and all that was left to pay for were the hotels, rental car, and some reservations. Her ex-husband called needing help getting his car out of impound and getting caught up on rent. Their son hasn't been able to get to work without the car because he doesn't want to ride a bike or take a bus. Almost 5 grand later they're set up but my wife told me she can't pay for her portion of our vacation, so I told her I was canceling it. She called me a heartless ass, that she's just taking care of her son and we've been arguing over it but my stance is this: they're both able-bodied adults that keep making a series of life decisions that keep them at a stand still (like quitting jobs over little things, smoking, going out) and her always digging them out of their hole is starting to impact our lives more and more, and I didn't sign up for that. AITA for canceling our vacation instead of just footing the entire cost myself?

\*\*\*To clarify: She contributes 30% of her pay to our joint expenses: bills/utilities, emergency fund, retirement. 70% of her pay she keeps for her personal expenses and to spend or save how she wishes. Dates, vacations, and fun things we choose to do together are budgeted and planned based on what we can afford from our personal funds. Pool that money together than pay together.",nta
"title: AITA for cancelling my son's birthday party upon discovering that he ruined his stepbrother's deceased brother's hoodie?
content: 
It's a complex situation but I'll do my best to explain.

I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say ""OK I get it"" and ""I won't do it again"".

Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.

Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said ""so what, maybe this will help him move on in life"". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.
He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.

Note: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.",nta
"title: AITA for cancelling the family trip after I found out that my wife cancelled my son's ticket?
content: Situation is a bit messy so bear with me.



I M42 have two boys, Adam 16 & Leo 14. Their mom passed away 5 years ago and I married my wife Rose about a year ago. Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.

What she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of ""he wouldn't be I interested anyway"" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.


I'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his ""moody personality and introvert nature"" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.


1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.

2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.

3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.

4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind ""last minute"" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.",nta

"title: AITA for changing the door locks back after my wife changed them?
content: I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. 

Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. 
Between my wife and my sister.

Update* sorry I haven’t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.

I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn’t allowed over without me home. 

I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it’s clean.

The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife’s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.

Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.

I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.

Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife’s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.

The big thing is she had my wife’s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife’s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn’t valuable it’s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.

Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. 
I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn’t have that key.

Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.
My wife said “have her meet me every morning at 5 am.” I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife’s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife’s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.

My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.
I can tell it really hit her that her life isn’t as hard. Even being grounded.

Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.
1) for awhile no family at our home
2) no family borrowing our things. 
3)no one is allowed a key
4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.
5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. 
My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn’t want to cause more issues but she just doesn’t trust my sister and can’t have her using out things.",yta

So my mother (F41) is home all day and is a SAH Mom, she watches my one 4 year old Brother and supposedly cleans the house, When me(M15)My sister(F17), and my brother(M16) get home the house is almost always a mess, and she then dumps all her chores on us, she does nothing and sits on her phone doing essentially nothing. For context, my mother is a Recovered Alcoholic who also has very severe ADHD, to the point where she could qualify for disability because of it. She is very disorganized and whenever she does work it's on some minutee job of very low priority, such as vacuuming for extremely long times, sorting through her beach rocks and other miscellaneous tasks while we clean the house. My dad usually gets angry at US because the house is never clean, dinner is never made, and nothing ever gets done. When she was an alcoholic she would borderline abuse us and my infant brother. She did recover and is still a very sweet person but when it comes to tasks and getting things done, she can't really do them, and has sincerely apologized, but she still retains traits from when she was an alcoholic. I finally snapped a bit when she told me that she was going to the BEACH at 6Pm before dinner had been made and told me to clean the whole house. I didnt think it was fair so I told her that it wasn't fair that she was going to give me all of her daily chores after a long day of school.

To make a long story short, we began dating in February of 2022. (I want to make clear, he is 8 months older than me and we're in half our classes together, this isnt one of THOSE stories)

Weve been together 15 months now. We're studying for exams right now but we still have a routine. 
I'm in Monday, Gym Tuesday night, In Wednesday, Thursday, Out Friday night, Out Saturday, Out Sunday until dinner.
This is what my family agreed to.
Ever since meeting him, they said they liked him but I didnt believe them.

On Saturday's, I have a curfew of 11. I come back at half 10, just incase. 2 nights ago was no different, but I got back at around 10:50 (I lost my glasses). I got in and my dad was saying I was late. This confused me, I wasn't late so I said that and how I lost my glasses. He then began ranting about how I spend too much time out the house and I spend no time with family, he tried saying I'm not allowed to see him at all anymore. I started talking back, saying when I do stay in I get yelled at OR I get sent up to my room, alone! Then mum got involved. I can't repeat everything, because I forgot, but theres 2 things my mum said that really stuck with me.
• ""He's an ugly manipulative b*tch""
• ""You aren't the girl we raised, I'm ashamed to be                                           your mum""
I lost it. I dont like being yelled at. Alot more was said but those were the 2 main things. I've been bullied in and out of school, but hearing what my mum said isnt something I'll forget. I argued it wasnt fair and it was my life. I began to cry, my mum laughed at me. I spent the rest of the night crying and I eventually passed out. Yesterday was meant to be like every other Sunday, I got up and got ready to go to the market with my boyfriend, as I was about to leave, my dad stopped me. He said: ""if you leave to go, you may aswell not come back"". I left anyways.

I've never felt this way before, my boyfriend has been there for me. I spent a month in hospital last year, he brung stuff and visited me even though I was an hour away. His family have given me what I was missing growing up. They involve me in things, buy me gifts and love talking to me. They all make me so happy.

I went home using my key. Silence. I checked if I had food, nope. I was completely ignored. I skipped dinner. I wasn't spoken to or acknowledged. Today, the same. Its like I dont exist to them, which is fine but it sucks knowing that it's because of my boyfriend.

AITA for this, am I seeing it wrong?",nta
"title: AITA for choosing my grandmother instead of my mom?
content: I (23 f)  had an argument with my sister (31 f) few days ago, here some context: 
So towards the end of September 2018  my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer it was very difficult for all the family but we did our best to support and help her. 


Towards the end of 2019 my sister moved in another country (she was not leaving with us anyway) mom was doing good an we all agree that she had to go and with the promise that I would join her when mum was better.


I moved one year later in 2020, my sister helped me in everything and I'm really glad for this but sometimes she was acting like she's my mom which used to lead us into fights (classic relationship between sisters love and hate).


In march 2023 I went to visit my mom for one week (my sister went one week after me whit her boyfriend) mom told me that she was diagnosed with bone cancer and have to do all the chemio terapy again, so me and my sister decided to start visit mom more often to help her (I used to visit her at least once a year).


So now comes the issue, after I lost my previously job I started work as freelance wich means that the days I don't work I don't get paid, 


The day we had the argument I text my sister to tell her that I had decided to go back home for Christmas and that it would be nice if she too came with her boyfriend to spend Christmas with the family since we hadn't spent Christmas with mum for years; 
she replied that we first had to organize to go for mum's birthday which will be at the end of July I told her that I could not be there since at the end of June I would go to visit my paternal grandmother since I hadn't seen her since I was 5 years old (my grandfather is dead) and that my job and my economic conditions did not allow me to face 2 trips in such a short time. 


So she start to complain that's my fault if i don't have the money to afford 2 trips cuz I'm the one that decides to work with a freelancer contract and that I should priorities my mum to my grandma or find the money to do both, and that she would be able to make both trips easily (My sister hasn't worked for a year now so her boyfriend pays for everything bills and rental house too he have a really well paid job so he don't mind pay for everything).


Her words really hurt me cuz she knows that after i lost my job I spent a lot of time searching for another one and didn't had many choices when I found my current one, I started cry I was feeling guilty.

So I called my mom to ask if she was okay with my decision, she was very happy that I would finally see my grandma (expecially cuz she's losing her sight) and the rest of my father's family and that if she was feeling well by then she would be happy come with me. 
Hearing her words made me feel better but part of me thinks i'm doing the wrong thing.


Ps: my sister and I don't have the same father my mom raised us by herself because my sister's father died when she was 8 and my father never cared about me and he went no contact with his family.

"title: AITA for complaining about picking up my sister from work every night?
content: For context, my sister (26) works at a shop about 20 minutes away from home, and they close at midnight. I have classes that start at 9 in the morning on weekdays, so it gets really frustrating having to wake up from my sleep just to pick her up. 

I live in the Philippines where there are bike hailing apps available, so I brought this up to my sister as a suggestion. The ride home could total to 80 pesos, which is about a dollar and a half. My sister refuses to learn how to use it, and my mom added that something bad might happen to her even with these apps. While I know that's still a possibility, it's not very likely with these apps as I know they follow a sign-up process for riders and you can literally send a link to someone you know to track your ride if safety is a concern.

I'm pretty sure they won't change their minds anytime soon, but I just want to take off the guilt off from my mom telling me I'm quick to do nice things for friends, but not for family.",info
"title: AITA for confronting my BF (30M) as he hasn't really helped regarding us moving in together?
content: I (29F) and my boyfriend of 2 years (30M) just moved in together last week. We were both living separately until then. Now I know I have been off on annual leave last week, and because of this, I would be doing the brunt of the workload during his working hours, but considering his Dad and I moved almost all of his things - bar really heavy items (i.e. his massive TV and his heavy weights) as I have a bad heart.

I got annoyed at him on Saturday, as I had been busy building furniture for the bathroom, and he fell asleep on the couch and didn't help much around the house at all.

This is where I may be the AH. I snapped at him earlier today and confronted him, saying that whilst I appreciate that he has been busy with work, but I also work full time and I don't think it's fair that I'm doing all of the house work. He bit back saying he sorted everything out into their allocated rooms (because he wanted his training room up and running), but in the end that just gave me even more work to do in order to have a liveable space. He also argued that he set up the bills, which I'll concede there. 

I'm at my wits' end and just feel like crying. Am I overreacting?",info
"title: AITA for confronting my friend?
content: I (female 17) live with my mum in a small council estate where a lot of people from my sixth form live. Me and this girl have been pretty good friends since primary we would swear in secret at primary and do stupid things etc.. 

Last month a group was made to discuss random things at school and i was at my dad (my parents divorced) but i’d forgotten something at my mums. I went home about 4pm that night to get changed when one my phone pinged.
It was the group chat and my friend who lives round the back of my house had sent a one minute video on snap. I was getting changed at that point and then another video came through so i just left my phone. 

I had thought nothing of it at all but my window wasn’t closed and it was pretty light, enough for her to see through it. I didn’t see it coming at all when i picked up my phone and unlocked it. I didn’t look in the group for about 10 minutes and when i did rage and anger flooded through me. I never thought she’d do this type of stuff. She had sent a video of me getting changed to a massive group chat and most of my year had seen it by then. 

I had no idea what to do so i left it till monday when i questioned her. She said she hadn’t meant anything by it but i was really mad and went off on one. She started saying i was a bad person, i’m in the wrong and things like that. I was pretty hurt by everything she had done and said because me and her we’re friends for years now. I still haven’t spoke to her and i can’t face her.

I’ve had lots of people saying i’m petty and fake but most of all people spreading rumours and it’s starting to get to me. I’m being called an asshole but i don’t think i’m in the wrong. I don’t feel it’s right to involve the school. 
I just wanted to get others views on whether i was the asshole or i handled it alright, i regret how i said it all after but i was pretty generous and calm but she started getting rude. I really don’t know what to think about it all. 
So, AITA??",nta
"title: AITA for confronting two friends when one specifically asked me not to?
content: I realize this is petty af, just saying.

I have a friend “C” who is extremely loyal and generally wonderful, however is also very possessive of me and our friendship. This has led to several points of contention in regard to my other close friends. She has zero interest in being friends with my other friends which is fine, it just makes social gatherings awkward because she is unable to hide her jealousy.

Recently she told me that my other best friend “E” blocked her on Facebook. I was pretty taken aback because E is not the petty dramatic type. C was adamant that E blocked her but she asked me not to ask E about it.

I really wanted to clear the air so I told E that I noticed her and C weren’t friends anymore to see what she would say. E was clear that she never unfriended her as she had no reason to. She genuinely liked C.

I told C that E didn’t unfriend her and C went absolutely apeshit, calling E a liar, untrustworthy, accused E of coaching her kids to hate C, told E that her kids can ‘fuck off,’ among other insults. She blamed me for starting this drama, and yet I feel like her reaction is her own doing. I genuinely wanted to clear the air, but C is now ignoring me.

This is the second close friend of mine that C refuses to talk to for (in my mind) made up grievances.

"title: AITA for considering a 2.5 weeks vacation with only one of my children?
content: I moved from France to the United States about 6 years ago and like to go back yearly to see my family, friends and more generally my country. 2020 excluded, I’ve been back a few weeks every summer, and my husband’s always come along, as well as my first daughter then my second. It’s important to me that they get to know the family, language and culture of their second country. They’re now almost 6 and 2.5 years old. This year, my husband decided he was not going to make it to France, partly because of work, partly because he wants to feel like he has control over his decisions. I worked on myself and decided I was OK traveling with both kids alone, although toddler is prone to tantrums and very clingy. Thing is, it will also be my best friend’s bachelorette party for a few days, and I don’t have anyone to look after them in France, as my youngest doesn’t like her grandpa and my mom doesn’t have the patience. I’ve come to consider only taking my 6 year old, making my travel easier, my vacation more relaxing, and more importantly, solving the issue of the bachelorette (my oldest daughter likes her grandpa fine) and spending quality time with her while the youngest stays home with her dad. Part of the time she would travel to Hawaii and Ojai with him, but she’d also have weeks without her mom and sister, and we’re very close and she is very mama oriented and jealous of her sister already although we’ve always tried to make things fair.

When we arrived there was a lady with her 2 sons and a daughter, I made eye contact with the lady and just smiled and waved at her to be nice. After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore 

I looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with ""My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem"" I then responded with ""I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers"" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said ""Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not"", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car

"title: AITA for cutting my hair after a friend's death despite a contract that dictates what I'm allowed to do - or not to do - with my hair?
content: I've ""lost"" my job and have been ostracized by my family, so I figured I'd come to the court of public opinion.

One of my best friends of over ten years lost her battle with the big C word on Christmas. Fuck cancer, y'all. I'm not handling it well, tbh. I feel like a really crazy person. I literally haven't stopped crying. 

Through all the tumultuous emotions, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. 

I don't know why, but I felt like I wanted to get rid of a psychological weight and my hair was suffocating me.

 I 'model' and I've been doing it pretty much my whole life. My family is upper middle class due to my income. My parents 'work' as my mangers, even though I had actual, hired, experienced managers throughout the years. My dad works part time elsewhere, but I am the main breadwinner in the family. 

Part of my current contract was that I can't cut my hair without prior consent from managing parties or else my contract could be rendered void. It wasn't really an issue until now.

For a week, I tried to get consent, but nobody wanted to give it. So, over the weekend, I locked myself in my bathroom and chopped off almost all of my hair. I didn't go as extreme as 2007 Brittany, but I was definitely channeling her energy. 

Now I look like Steve from Stranger Things. 

I don't feel a lot better, but it was kind of cathartic. I'm glad I did it. My life changed, and I physically reflect that now.

Now I'm unemployed, though, cause I was released from my contract and as soon as I'm done with high school, my family wants me gone.

I know that I jeopardized my family's financial security, and my parents are scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills because I may have been an immature asshole, but, I dunno, maybe it's grief, but I feel pretty apathetic about it. I wanted to grieve in my own way.

Am I the asshole for that?

UPDATE: 6.35PM

So I talked to a few folks today, and I was sent a copy of the email exchanges that ultimately ended my contract. 

My contract was set to expire in June, but I wasn't booking until May to give myself time to finish up my last semester in high school. Instead of terminating my contract or 'firing me', i was released from my contract in a really nice way. 

I won't copy/paste, but the gist is;

Here at Company we value the health and safety of all our employees and it seems that Brittany is going through a hard time. Let's release her from her responsibility so she can enjoy school, and should she decide to come back after high school or freshman year of college, she'll be welcomed back into the agency.

They even sent a .pdf of therapists or counselors that I might wanna talk to. 

I talked to my old manager and she set me up in contact with a lawyer and already has access to copies of my documents, which she sent me in .pdf, too. I also contacted Jasmine's mom, who said that I can move in to finish hs if I'm kicked out in March. 

I'm not gunna say much, but what my parents were doing was definitely illegal unless I have trusts, which I doubt bc my parents both have nice new cars and stuff.

I also emailed my school guidance counselor. 

I have a new email contact, and I'll be sent my financial records ASAP. 

So... yeah. Posting this morning, I honestly felt like an ungrateful, whiny teen who fucked over her family, but you guys made me realize that my life is *definitely* not normal or fair, and I thank you all for that, and for the immeasurably kind words you've all given me.

I'll keep fighting!

"title: AITA for deciding I won't give any Christmas gifts this year after my mom cancelled a transaction on my card?
content: I'm still angry over this and I may not write very well, and also I probably don't judge the situation very well being this angry so I came to you.

I'm a student. I have a student bank account, where my college gives me money for transport (when we had physical classes) or scholarship. These kind of bank accounts have no fees, but are age restricted (can't have one if you're over 25) and need an overseer. When I asked the bank about it, they told me it's just a security thing so I chosen mom because she's more tech savvy than dad.

Well through some incredible luck I managed to get only top grades last year so I was awarded a study scholarship. Great! I've been saving it up, looking forward to word wide Black Friday, eyeing an amazing drawing tablet. I do digital art on very old intros, the tablet I was eyeing is as big as my monitor, is a display one and all around amazing.

Black Friday rolls in, and Amazon Germany (closest to me) has it in stock at an amazing price! A price I could afford! I was so damn happy, I ordered it. 

Then I got a notice that the bank refused the card. I emailed Amazon (their customer service is so fast) and we went over the card details and such making sure it was alright. It was and they advised me to call my bank. 

It was odd, I had bought things online in the past with this card and it went through. I had enough money for it (even extra) so I thought maybe they had technical difficulties. But it was too late in the day to call and they don't work weekends, so I left an email.

Only to find out today that for ""big transactions"" they ask for agreement from the overseer and that mine cancelled the transfer. I was like wtf and confronted mom about it (who throughout the weekend acted oblivious) and she told me that of course she couldn't let me ""throw money on something I don't need"" and that ""I wouldn't have money for Christmas presents if I bought that"". Then she had the audacity to ask me what I was planning to get my family this year.

I told her that they won't get anything more than a bread shadow* from me and I went to my room and cried on the carpet. I missed out on the offer, I can't afford the tablet anymore and it's all because mom wanted Christmas gifts. And no, I won't get her anything. Last year she got me a blouse too small for me that she later took for herself. She can gift herself this year too.

*Bread shadow= expression for nothing in my language

Edit: there are so many comments and I thank you all, I'm trying to reply to all of you but it'll take a while

Edit 2: thank you so so much for people offering me money in comments and dm but I can't accept that. I'm really grateful for you trying to help but I really can't take that. I'm really thankful for the offers and advice

#Edit 3: all hail u/Epic-Hamster!

So many people offered me advice, money, their tablets or other means of helping and I'm really thankful to you all! Also, lots of you told me to check the sale that's going on right now but the tablet I ordered wasn't on sale, yet u/Epic-Hamster found it (same specs different seller) at sale at an even better price than the Black Friday sale! I ordered it, it went through this time, and I'm so happy and excited!

Thank you, from all of my heart to everyone. I'm still going to reply to all of you, even if it's going to take me all night. Happy holidays for all of you!

Edit: it seems like I can't reply to you guys anymore sadly but if you want to you can send me a pm, I don't think I'll sleep this night anyway

#FAQ

(Now I really get why these are called frequently asked questions)

• This account I have to have because of my Uni, but I'm going to make dad the overseer and also open an account at another bank (a normal one) and transfer the money in small amounts to that one so I don't bother dad with it

• Also considering asking him just to be for form and the app to be on my phone so I'll be my own overseer

• I am an adult in my country, I'm 20, going to be 21 in April. The law asks my parents to support me until I finish my studies or at least until I'm 26, but I plan on moving out sooner

• I'll do gift my sister and dad, they have nothing to do with the incident and I love them lots

• I love mom too but can't put up with her attitude any longer

• Regarding what I'll give her, not sure yet but there are some amazing ideas in the comments

• She didn't react like that because she got me the tablet already, it's not her character to get me something she can't use. 

• Regarding the gift dad's planning on and which she'll claim is from both of them, dad is going to build a bigger enclosure for my lizard. 

• I may wrap my lizard's old branches nice and gift those to mom, as per Christmas traditions regarding naughty kids. And she doesn't like my scaly boy at all so double points I guess

• People saying that a drawing tablet is useless, thanks for your input but the question was if I was an A for the way I reacted and my decision to not give her a gift anymore. As it's my money I literary can do whatever I wish with it and a display drawing tablet is incredible useful for an aspiring digital artist as myself.

Thank you all who commented, I'll really try to reply to you all but you're so many! Thank you lots!

Edit number I lost count: Glad so many people like the bread shadow! It's a regional Romanian idiom! Would you eat some beans for us on 1st Dec? It's our national day, traditionally celebrated by eating beans with meat but if you're not okay with the meat that's okay too. I love you all!",nta
"title: AITA for demanding my mom apologize after she blew up at my girlfriend who she thought was being racist?

My parents came over for dinner last night and my girlfriend was going to cook. Neither of us cook much and we eat way too much takeout, so she decided to make fried chicken because it is something she made with her mom growing up. Her mom came here from the Philippines and I guess it is pretty popular over there.

When my mom saw the fried chicken she thought that my girlfriend was either making fun of her or just going off a racial stereotype. She immediately started cussing at her and demanding an apology. I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.

She calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave. I’m not talking to her until she apologizes but I don’t know if that is too harsh.",nta
"title: AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?
content: Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?",nta

I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I’s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he’s wanted to “talk to me about this for a long time”

He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn’t “what god wants”. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn’t think it’s right that we’re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won’t be coming to the wedding because he didn’t “want to have to explain to her what was going on here”.

Notice he only said that SHE wasn’t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad’s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I’ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. 

I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they’re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn’t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they’ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. 

I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we’re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren’t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.

Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between “youre the asshole, he’s family. Invite him” and “he’s the asshole, fuck him. Don’t invite him”. I’m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn’t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own. 

And no my story isn’t fake. I recorded the conversation",nta
"title: AITA for disrespecting my bf mom
content: hi everyone its been a while I will be going more into detail about everything in the last post and im sorry if this post is long

my (at the time) boyfriend 'Luke' had sent me a screen shot of his mom 'Maddie' calling my mom a useless mother because of my grades (I have a learning disability and school is very hard for me but im getting help) and saying ""op looked high yesterday, is she using drugs. I think she's a drug addict""

I had asked her if she didn't like me a I will put the text in here and I will put our texts

Maddie- ""first of all, know your place. your 15- if you can ask these questions be prepared for the answer. you shouldn't be texting/talking till 4 am. you should not be failing all your classes. I actually told my son I was going to motive you to get better grades.""

Me- "" yes I do know my place, yes you can talk to your son about me but please if you have a question about me using drugs please bring it to me so we can talk about it and please explain how me texting my boyfriend a lot a red flag""

Maddie - "" ok. this is where I stop you. my job is to protect my son. the way you are speaking to me is completely out of line I was not speaking badly about you, I was having a conversation with my son""

Me - "" I don't know what I did to make you not like me I have tried and tried over and over again to make you like me no I don't do drugs I was not high yesterday I was tired""

Maddie - ""im not arguing with you, im not one of your friends. im your boyfriends mother!! he took a conversation we were having and involved you where there was absolutely no need to. if you want beef- beef with him this is nonsense""

Me - ""please don't speak about my mother that was very uncalled for""

Maddie - "" I am going to say this one more time. you do not get to speak to me that way. the level of disrespect is absolutely ridiculous. if he'd like to share all of our text threads that's fine because they will continue- not about you but about whatever he wants to speak about. I coach that kid through the school day every single day.""

Me - ""Listen im failing school bc i have a learning disability. i will not stand for you disrespecting me and my mom. i am trying my hardest to be the nicest I can to you i am sorry for disrespectful I was and if you need to ask something you have my number and i can always text again im sorry for being disrespectful""

Maddie - ""Ok so number one if you were as mature if you want to be you’d know this is NOT an apology. So there’s that.You are child and your level of disrespect in speaking to your boyfriends mother is off the charts.""

me - ""I understand your his mom but you still have no right to talk about me or my mom youve never met my mom you know nothing of my mother""

Maddie - ""You are not welcome here. I wont take this from you.""

after that argument she had blocked me. we broke up like 2 months after this yes I know I am semi the asshole here but I wanted to come out with a post that went into more detail about it so AITA",nta
"title: AITA for disrespecting my dad?
content: 
I (19f) am a full time college student living with my mom (56f) and my dad (62m). Around this time last year, my maternal aunt passed and was followed a few days later with my maternal grandfather. His death was sudden, so my mom had to do a lot of legality stuff. Including in this legality, my mom became my maternal grandmothers power of attorney since she has dementia.

Fast forward to a month ago, my grandmother was hospitalized and diagnosed with vascular dementia. It was decided to proceed with a DNR and go the hospice route. My mom and I have been going over to my grandparents house from 8am-8pm every day (when I don’t have class, I’ll still go to my grandparents after class which is an hour away) and spend as much time as possible acting as a hospice nurse since our state doesn’t provide 24/7 care. I have been over there full time trying to help take care of my grandmother and support my mom while prepping for finals. My mom left my dad some of the responsibilities of our house since I can go over and pick up the weekly chores.

My dad has always been a bit lazy - he works part time since he has his a barbering business but he only cooks and does dishes while my mom is the breadwinner working full time and doing the rest of the chores when I don’t - and all that she really wanted him to do was the cat litter and give our asthmatic cat her medicine before she has an attack. The medicine is meant to be a preventative since it’s so hard to get her out of an attack once it happened. 

When I got home to do the rest of the chores, the cat litter box was full (one of the cats doing their business outside of it, it was that full) and the asthmatic cat was in a full blown attack. He gave her medicine during that time, but hours later she still wasn’t doing okay so I told him to give her more. My dad started to complain about it since “she already had her medicine earlier and was fine” and I tried to explain how it’s preventative and made an analogy to how you put oil in a car (ngl I was annoyed so my tone was kinda harsh) and he just blew up on me, telling me “I’m your father, I deserve to be treated with respect, so don’t speak to me in that tone” and just started to yell. I just went upstairs and sat in my room until he eventually went to bed, and then I packed up my stuff and went back to my grandparents.

This morning he came to mow the lawn at my grandparents, and my mom tried to speak to him about it since I told her this stuff last night. He only told her that I “disrespected him” and refuses to elaborate. I’m in class now and I still have to go back to our house and do the rest of the chores (including the ones my mom gave my dad to do since she doesn’t trust him to do it) and I was wondering if I should apologize. I don’t really know if I should, since I don’t feel like I was in the wrong, AITA though?",nta
"title: AITA for ditching someone to go home?
content: I (f 18) had an exam yesterday at a place 2 hours away from my house. I agreed to go out with a guy (m 22) for a date. We've gone out once before too, and I found him cool. My parents don't let me out of my house because I'm grounded, and especially not on a date. He knows about this and still is okay with it.

 My exam finished at 5 20 pm. We had agreed to meet at 5 45 the day prior. I understand he might be busy, so I asked him several times whether it was okay and he said yes. Well, I walked to the station and stood there for an hour waiting. I'd given him a precise location and mentioned my battery was low. My phone died by 6 15, so I couldn't even text him. I got really pissed at the time and went home dejected and tired from the exam. Also, I hadn't eaten since 8 am because the exam was lengthy and I had no time between travelling. I was really looking forward to enjoying a McDonalds burger with him but he wasn't there. I reached home at 9, and (ik it's not his fault) I was catcalled on the way and it made me feel bad I waited so long for no reason.

My phone hung and started directly in the morning, so I couldn't text him at all during the night. I woke up late in the morning and switched on my phone. He had texted me at 6 20 that he was there and we hadn't seen each other. He wasn't at all angry, just really concerned and checking up if I was okay. I felt really guilty for being angry (though I didn't tell him) and feel bad that I left, but I really needed to get home. 

AITA?

For context, I have a really crappy phone from 2015.",nah

Then i hear my roommate kinda mumble 'you couldn't have waited til i was awake for that', to which i just said sorry (what else am i supposed to say), and then she got up and used the bathroom and stuff, but she was kind of a bit slammy with doors/cabinets.

"title: AITA for doing weird/awkward poses whenever my MIL ""accidently"" walks in on me in the bathroom?
content: So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.


The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.


She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming ""she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel ""terrified/weirded out"" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.


Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a ""me problem"" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it 😅🤣 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow. Especially after what happened. Lol.",nta
"title: AITA for dragging my bf away from his family?
content: My boyfriend (22) and myself (21) have been together for about a year. He moved in with me about five months ago. About six months ago we decided to set one specific day of the week to be our date day. Just to give us more one on one time. We both work full time and I’m going to college. The free time that we do have we usually spend with family/friends. Occasionally he “forgets” date night and has to be reminded that this is our only quality time together. Other than falling asleep together at the end of the night. So having that extra quality time does mean a lot to me. Which he has gotten better on not forgetting them or actually going through with them and understanding it’s part of my love language. 

We have been arguing a bit more lately and I’m leaving for a three week vacation in a couple of days. So I wanted to do something a little more special than just dinner and a movie. I decided to do a surprise date night (still on the scheduled day we both agreed on, surprise just meaning more than the usual) with a couple of things we could do together without the screens. 
So I called him and asked what time he would be home. He said soon and I started getting everything ready. After that I got about three more calls saying it was going to be later and later because he was helping his dad get ready for his sisters wedding later this year. I was not upset because I know these things need to get done and his dad can’t do them without his help. 

A couple hours pass and I get another phone call inviting me over there for dinner because his dad offered to get him food in return for helping him all day. At this point I told him everything I had planned and said I didn’t want to go over there. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind skipping the dinner either because I had done so much already, knowing his dad would understand. He decided to stay there and eat. I said nothing and waited for him to get home to tell him how I felt. 

I started telling him how I felt and he listened to the whole thing without any interruptions at the very end of it he stood up and walked away. I followed asking him if he would communicate what was on his mind. He said “you just think that you’re more important than my family and I shouldn’t spend time with or love anyone as much as you.” I was shocked. I had no idea what to say. I don’t think any of those things, but being that I am leaving in a couple of days and this was the last day to spend together I thought maybe I would come first. It ended up turning into a heated argument and him telling me I was being selfish and “you could’ve just enjoyed the last hour we had before I had to go to bed but instead you started an argument cause I spent time with my dad.”  I ended up crawling in bed and dropped the conversation. 
So my question is am I being selfish, am I overreacting, and am I being the asshole for dragging him away from family?",yta
"title: AITA for dropping our dinner on the ground and walking out when my boyfriend asked me ""What's for dinner tonight, b*tch?""
content: I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes ""what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH"" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. 

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!"" 

He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us

AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me ""what's for dinner tonight, b*tch""

Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:

> ""But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?""

Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. 

This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like ""Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)""

And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT ""UNDERSTAND""",nta
"title: AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?
content:  My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for eating my cupcake outside?
content: I have a 10 years old daughter who loves frosting. Every week I buy cupcakes for me, my wife and her and she always eats my frosting. These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to ""steal her frostings for weeks""

She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA?

Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah

Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here.

My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake

Nahhh lol

So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good

"title: AITA for embarrassing a lunch thief at work.
content: So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up.

So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. 

I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. 

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.

He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.

He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.

Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA

Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.

Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. 

Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. 

Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. 

People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.

I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.

So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",nta
"title: AITA for encouraging my sisters addiction because I’m scared to tell her to stop ?
content: I feel like I’m in the wrong sub for this, but my sister has an alcohol problem, and I’m scared to get her help because I feel like she’ll spill my secrets. 

I used to drink and consume other stuff with her but I took a step back and stopped. And now that she’s taken things too far I have no idea how to let her know that it’s wrong, or that I’m not happy with what’s she’s doing.

Our relationship is different. Even though I’m the older one, we’ve never had the “stern older sibling” thing. We were more like friends honestly and I never bosses her around (or maybe she never listened?), i never shouted at her, I’ve never called her out, and I’ve never pulled the older sister card ever really. I was more like the really close best friend who would give her advice but she’d never take it. 

The main issue is that our parents don’t know that I used to drink, like ever. They don’t know that I’ve ever even touched drugs. I’ve never been caught and they have no reason to suspect it. I just can’t imagine my parents finding out. And if my sister knew that I raised some concerns with them or any one else, she’d immediately let them know of my past. Because to her I’m tattling, not helping her. 

So now every-time we talk and she mentions how the family is angry at her because she came home drunk last night (every day) I do nothing but nod and hum and agree with her delusional reasons and take her side. 

I cant bring myself to get involved or exposed. So I just keep quiet and let her make dumb decisions so … AITA?",yta

Neither Liz and Lisa like me. I understand why Lisa might not like me but I don't know why Liz doesn't. I didn't want to spend money on people who hate me to come to my wedding so I didn't invite Liz or Lisa (It was clearly mentioned in the wedding invitation too).

Ever since my brother got the invitation he is upset I'm excluding a vital part of his family. He wants me to put Lisa and Liz on the guest list. He's also mad that Mindy and her family are on the list and they (Lisa and Liz) aren't. I don't want to do it because it'll mess up my budget, his family is already 1/8 of the guest list, and again they (Liz and Lisa) hate me. My parent's also think I'm being unfair and childish.

I wanted to check AITA?

Edit: Forgot to add  The reason Mindy is invited is because she and I are very close. My brother and I have a huge age difference (I'm adopted btw) of 20 years and she was there for 10 years of my life (5-15). She is to me more like a sister than a SIL.

I told him he's free to decline the invite, but he doesn't want to and wants me to accommodate Lisa and Liz

 Lisa doesn't like because I'm very close to Mindy. I invite her(Mindy) to really important stuff (my 18 birthday, My College graduation, and a few of my birthdays (21 and 25)) and Lisa always complains and asks me to uninvite her and when I refuse she gets upset ",nta
"title: AITA for excluding my sister-in-laws?
content: Background: my(26F) husband (28M) has one sister (20F) and two sister-in-laws (SIL 1: 32F and SIL 2: 24F). Both sister-in-laws blatantly lied to both of his siblings in order to marry them, don’t know why honestly but that’s a different story for a different day. 

I have kind of been ostracized from them since they had multiple arguments because SIL 2 lies about literally everything and I said I just don’t want to hang out with someone if it’s gonna end up that she’s going to lie about me like she did other 2 SILS. well they all always spend time with each other even though they all hate each other and the past couple of times we’ve had the entire family together and took family pictures they’ve taken pictures alone, excluded me. And I don’t just mean they took photos while I wasn’t in the room. Last month at SIL 1 baby shower after MIL, SILS and I took a photo and I walked away to speak to my fiancé SIL 2 went “okay picture of *her and SILS names*” when I was 5 feet away. It broke my heart because oldest SIL and youngest SIL both despise this other sil and yet did not invite me to take a photo with them.

During this time I’ve been planning a wedding. I was going to have SIL 1 and husbands sister as my bridemaids but they both randomly blocked me due to unrelated family drama they created and  talked about me behind my back to create drama and deflect from themselves so I decided to just have my friends instead. None of them were invited dress shopping, none of them were invited to my bachelorette party out of state and I already was hearing flack about it. 

Flash forward to our wedding. It was last weekend and it was amazing. After the incident at the baby shower I was pissed that I was always the one left out when I wasn’t the one causing any problems. So when we were taking photos I decided to take photos of me with my bridal party, and then with my own sister and sister in laws who I’m not really close to. This obviously got under their skin like I wanted it to because of how often I had been left out of things. I heard an earful from my MIL and FIL about it hearing about the “importance of family” and I just told them “you reap what you sow” and left it at that. My husband fully agrees with what I’ve done and has had several talks with his family prior of how they don’t treat us the same as his other siblings. 

We’re on our honeymoon right now and haven’t stopped hearing complaints. I just want to know AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for expecting Mothers' Day is about me?
content: Hi.  My husband (48M) and I (44F) have a 14 year old son.  We've been together 23 years, married for 16 years.  Mothers' Day is a disaster and it's not even here yet.

Back Story:

I am disabled and almost never leave the house.  My husband works 8am to 5pm.  My son is in school all day.  I am alone all day (except for our puppers).  My husband planned a hiking/camping/biking weekend with his friends without realizing it was Mothers' Day weekend, Thursday through Sunday.  I said it was fine and we could go to dinner another day.  I told him I wanted to go the restaurant chain noted for their gardens of olives.  We live in a rural area and that restaurant is about a 45 minute drive from our home.  I said I wanted to take his mom and mine, along with my sister and brother in law,  My husband asked if I was sure I wanted to go that far?  Wouldn't it be better to stay in town (we have 2 restaurants that aren't fast-food)?  I explained that since he made plans and we would not be going ON Mothers' Day, so we can go when it is less crowded.  Etc.

&#x200B;

So, today, my husband comes to me and says he made Mothers' Day plans with his mom and didn't explain that I had a tentative plan.  (We all LOVE this restaurant, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen it).  Together they made a plan to grab some take-out and hang out at his moms house.  I said I had no issue and can we get take out from the restaurant I mentioned wanting to go to.  He never mentioned to her that I wanted to do something else.  When I explain that that is not okay, he says that I am manufacturing a reason to have an argument.  Be mindful, I have NEVER refused him.  If he wants something or wants to do something I support him.  I can't do all the hobbies he enjoys, but, I never discourage it.  AGAIN, I didn't even get frustrated that he planned a weekend with friends on Mothers' Day weekend.  Now, I'm starting arguments over nothing and Mothers' Day is not about me.  AITA for wanting to do more than take out for Mothers' Day?",nta
"title: AITA for expecting my boyfriend to replace all my socks, the exact same ones as I had before?
content: This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. 

I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. 

On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. 

The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. 

I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. 

So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. 

I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. 

AITA?

I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.

Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",nta
"title: AITA for expecting my roommate to clean up his mess in my area?
content: It's basically what it says. My (38f) roommate (45m) spilled some stuff in my bathroom, he has his own, & refuses to clean it up without praise because it's my bathroom & he shouldn't have to clean it. He does the same thing with the bath, he bathes our son in my bath because now his bathroom is disgusting but refuses to clean the bath. I end up doing it because I don't want my son bathing in a gross bath. I would make it a thing that if he won't clean the bath or his mess because it's in my bathroom he can't use it but the idea of my son using his bathroom disturbs me because it's nasty. 

His mess includes empty shampoo bottles, plastic wrappers for bath bombs, candy wrappers, if he spills soap or water out the bath, the bath tub has had a ring around it, he also won't take out gross toys like the ones with the holes in it and they get moldy. 

It's an instant fight about how I'm supposed to just do it because he just does other things (he doesn't, he'll dump food covered plates in the sink for me to now take out to scrap & say he helped). 

So am I the asshole for making him clean up his mess even though it's in my bathroom? It's definitely his mess, it's definitely my bathroom & he wouldn't be allowed to use it if it wasn't for my son.",info
"title: AITA for expecting my roommate to keep his ESA dog away from my cats?
content: When I (35, f) interviewed to move into this house, there were already two roommates, H (30, f) and L (30s, m). The lease had a two pet maximum, and I let them know I had two cats who would be coming with me. They agreed, and so did the landlord, meaning the 2-pet maximum had been reached. L did not mention to me at the time that sometimes his (technically ex) girlfriend K (f, 30s) comes over and brings her dog, F (f). 

When he started bringing the dog over, I was not informed, and they didn't think it would be a problem to let the dog around my cats. The cats would put their ears back and slink away. Once I saw this was happening, I let L and K know that I didn't want the cats around the dog. They told me, ""she lives with cats and she would never hurt them."" I said that while I believe them, the cats do not like it, and being stressed is not good for their health, so would they please shut the cats upstairs when they want to let the dog loose in the house? H backed me up and asked them to put the dog on a leash if they were just passing through the house on the way to L's bedroom.

As time went on, this request was sometimes followed, sometimes not. Sometimes I would come home to find that the cats and dog coexisting. It like they felt they only should do it if I would find out. Over time, the dog was over for weeks at a time, even if K was not there. 

Any time I tried to bring up my boundaries, I was met with the same disregard for my concerns. Because THEY believed their dog would not hurt the cats, they didn't feel it necessary. L had been PRESENT when the dog had started moving toward one of the cats and H had to stop her. The dog had also behaved aggressively toward a delivery man, when K had allowed her off-leash to run around the front yard while she was sunbathing nude in the back yard. Even after explaining that the behavior of dismissing boundaries was triggering to H and I, it didn't stop.

So then K gets another dog, a male. This dog, R, is more aggressive and they keep him on a leash. We even see him in a muzzle at one point. L tells H that he has, ""stranger danger issues we are working on"", but never informs me or introduces me to the dog, so it behaves aggressively toward ME. At one point, F needs surgery and I agree that she can recover at our house, but I put up barriers to divide the house into ""cat town"" and ""dog town"". I let him know this is temporary and, ""at no point will the cats and dog be in the same room.""

Then I come home one day and he's in the living room with the male dog on a leash and both cats. I text him that I am upset and he responds that ""he was on a leash"" and he now has ESA paperwork for this dog and it will be staying with him. He led us to believe the dog belonged to K while he got this paperwork to FORCE us into a situation he knew we were not comfortable with. I used to consider L a friend, and now H and I can't trust him. I am going to do everything in my power to get him out of our house. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for exposing my parents' favoritism
content: My parents have always favored my younger brother. I was by no means unloved. But it was blatantly obvious who they cared about more. I worked a part time job to get my first car, but my brother got one as a present. It wasn't new, but was much newer than my car. It was the same with just about anything else, like clothes, video games and cell phones.

I'm 18 and am taking a gap year before community college to work a full time job and save money for tuition. But a while back I heard my parents talking about how much they were going to pay for my brother's tuition. I secretly recorded the conversation from around the corner and then came out asking my parents why they were gonna pay for my brother's college, but not mine. They didn't notice my phone was recording and just said that my brother needs more help. I asked how so when I wasn't getting any sort of scholarship, and he likely wouldn't either. Then I asked a few more questions about why things have always been this way. They got mad and my father told me that perhaps it's time I moved out because they are sick of keeping a roof over my head. I pointed out I pay rent. But they didn't care.

I left the room and in a fit of rage uploaded the video to two different social medias I have and ranted about how this is how my parents have always been. Well a few hours my parents were pounding at my door. My dad was screaming at me about how I made them look bad. We fought some more and they left the room fuming.

My grandparents contacted me later and said they were appalled, then came to visit with a lot of the family the next day. There was a huge family intervention and my parents were made to sit on the couch and look at their feet while being told off. It was then I found out they'd been receiving money for years from my grandparents to help with family expenses. My brother looked like he didn't know what to do. So he sided with the rest of the family and said he's noticed how I'm treated as well. My parents gave me a huge apology that sounded forced.

My grandparents have offered that I come live with them soon and will cut off the monthly payments to my parents, my father told me I should have never told the rest of the family and now won't talk to me, and my mother has been crying for days. So I'm starting to wonder if I went to far.

"title: AITA for expressing my view on religion and ruining Mother’s Day?
content: I (20F) was raised in a very strict catholic house hold. Since I moved out two years ago, I stopped going to church and tend to pray on my own, or I found different ways to express my beliefs. I just have a lot of problems with the Catholic Church and how the catholic community treats others, and I have a lot of religious trauma from growing up, so I don’t make church a priority. But I still believe in God and pray on my own.

A few days ago, my mom asked me if I was going to church and I said no. She asked me why not, and I replied that I would prefer to practice on my own. She called me a massive sinner and started yelling and asked me where I got that idea from. I said that it never explicitly states in the Bible that church is mandatory, just to keep the sabbath holy. She screamed and said she raised me better and I should know what I’m doing is wrong. I remained calm the whole time.

Up until today, she hadn’t spoken to me at all. But, she said today that I hurt her feelings badly, and she no longer wants to celebrate Mother’s Day because I’ve ruined it. This was upsetting to me because I planned out a whole day for her as a surprise, but I guess she can do what she wants. Additionally, I live in a different city and I’m only in town this week. Some of my friends are saying I should have just told her what she wanted to hear, and others are saying I stood my ground and she be treated like an adult.

AITA for expressing my different religious views? 

Tl;Dr: my mom cancelled Mother’s Day because I’m no longer going to church and I said it’s not important to me to attend church.",nta

"title: AITA for firing my babysitter for getting drunk on the job
content: This is my throwaway account. 

My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She’s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we’ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she’d like me to keep at the house as she’s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer’s for me and my husband, and didn’t think anything of it. 
A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn’t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. 
She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer’s. I told her to leave and she walked home. 
She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer’s were alcohol, and she hadn’t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn’t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn’t my fault she got drunk. 
My husband says I’m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn’t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go.

"title: AITA for forcing health onto a child?

My partners son has a diagnosed vitamin C and D deficiency, unfortunately due to something the kid read online he doesn’t believe in vitamins, also refuses to eat healthy regardless.
 My partner doesn’t think it’s right that I’ve been dosing their sons cupcake frosting with crushed multivitamins lately. They already outed me to their son for blending additional vegetables into smoothies and spaghetti and now he refuses to eat certain things.

"title: AITA for forcing my son to use a bidet and threatening to talk to his friends or take him to the doctor about his underwear
content: For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  

Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  

First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  

I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. 

He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  

So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  

I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.  

He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",info
"title: AITA for forcing my tomboy daughter to wear formal clothing?
content: Hi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.

However, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.

But, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.

She got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.

Some of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into ""streetwear."" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?

I think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.

That being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.

Parenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement.",nta
"title: AITA for getting a CT and making my own plans on my birthday?
content: My(F25) birthday was recently and it went horrible. I have a partner(M29) who isn't the best at birthdays, so for the past four years we've been together I haven't really gotten much for birthday celebration. 
He's only once taken the day off, and even that day he didn't have a choice because of an injury. Because of this, I was not expecting anything big. I was sure he would get me a gift but that was probably going to be it.

Since I wasn't expecting anything, I planned to go to the city that is an hour and a half away, to get a CT scan. And to just spend the day doing whatever I like. Maybe buy myself a cake, I can't have gluten so I didn't think he would have one(plus he'd never gotten me a cake before).

My partner knew of these plans, and didn't say much. And I knew from our work schedule that he was working. He asked a few times what time I will be home but I didn't have a timeline because I had no expectations.

When I didn't give him a time, he got upset said he had made reservations that he wanted to go to. After hearing that I asked what time and said I would make it back. But by time he said that, he had already canceled the reservations.

So I ended up going to the city anyways. Later my mom messaged and basically told me I made an ass of myself because he had planned a surprise party. But because I went to the city he canceled it and was really upset with me. They basically both put all the blame on to me. I ended up crying in the waiting room for the CT and having a anxiety attack afterwards. I felt so bad for the admin there.

Anyways, I was just wondering if it truly was my fault or if I'm valid in being upset that they didn't give me a reason to be home at a certain time?

Just a side note, my partner knows I have a really hard time not knowing plans. I really like to have a schedule, and I don't like sudden changes to a schedule.",nta

content: I’m (28f) my brother’s (16m) guardian due to shitty family circumstances. He has a part-time job at a restaurant. On weekdays, he works until 10pm. I pick him up from work on weekdays because I don’t want him taking the bus at that hour. We live in a big city and I worry about him being out at night by himself.

I went out of town for a few days for work. When I was gone, my boyfriend agreed to pick up my brother from work. He only had to pick him up once.

When I got back, I found out that he didn’t do it. He said that he forgot, despite me texting him twice that day to remind him. He went to hang out with his friends instead, so when my brother texted him to ask if was coming, he said that he couldn’t because he had been drinking. My brother took the bus instead.

I asked my boyfriend about it and he said it’s not his fault because he “just forgot”, and it doesn’t matter because nothing happened to my brother anyway. He’s said before that I’m overprotective of my brother. I disagree with that, but I digress. He didn’t apologize and instead said that I was being ridiculous. 

My brother would probably be okay if he took the bus every night. But I would rather drive him around than roll the dice on that. The area that we live in isn’t exactly safe. And regardless, that’s not the point.

I asked him to do one thing while I was gone, which he agreed to and then reassured me that he would do. I don’t really believe that he actually forgot because he doesn’t generally forget to do things when I ask him to, but I suppose I can’t be certain of that. 

We got into a fight about it. He said that I’m being irrational, but I don’t feel like I was wrong for being upset with him? But I want an outside perspective.",nta
"title: AITA for getting mad and talking bad about a 10 year old
content: I (17f) have a cousin (10f) who stayed with us a couple weeks ago. Everyone she comes over she acts like she owns the house. She’ll just go upstairs whenever she wants and play with our electronics. She’ll eat all our food and claim the guest room as “her room”. Worst thing she never asks about the food or games. I personally don’t really like her. Never have. She’s always been really annoying and gets her way about everything. If not she cries. My grandma has come after me and my other siblings and cousins for excluding her. Even my 25m brother. We’ve tried telling her to ask and that we don’t like certain things

She’s pushy and will snitch if we are “bullying” her. I’m not trying to bully her but I’m really fed up. We’ve tried telling grandma and her mom but they say we need to be nice to her. She always goes with us when we want to hang out and when she’s at our house she’s always complaining she’s bored. She has a really bad attitude as well and talks back to her mom. Me, my brother, and cousin were talking about her and the things that annoy us. And she heard and told her mom. We all got yelled at. I just need to know if I’m the AH.

Edit: I get what people are saying about her being 10 and I agree I was mean about it. I put it in a comment I didn’t think it was important at first more things she’s done. She hasn’t gotten in trouble for it. She broke my 1400 piece Lego set that i bought and was super proud of. And dumped fish food in my fish tank. She didn’t get in trouble at all. But when I accidentally dropped her doll and it upset her I got in trouble. She does it to my brother too. He’s tried setting boundaries about her holding my 11 month old nephew. He’s talked to her and her mom about it cause she just walks up and tries to grab him.

Edit 2: should’ve made the title different. We weren’t necessarily talking bad about just her it was more complaining about grandma, her mom, and her as a whole. She caught the line my brother said “I wish someone would teacher how to behave at someone else’s house” this was after she went to grab my nephew. She turns 11 in a couple weeks and I have to work on her birthday party so I said I can’t go buy I’ll get her a present. Guess who got in trouble for not being there? I can’t take off because I’ve take n the past couple weekends off for prom shopping and prom. So I kinda need money for gas",nta

content: so out of my whole family ive had straight a's and honor roll. however, i dont consider myself smart. i get alot of help from my classmates and i use google and math apps and consider math difficult. My fav subject is english, yet i suck at writing and dont even know what a hyperbole is. btw im 14f so i dont even consider middleschool grades important for the future. im slightly lazy as ive never even done a school sport, i stay up late, i dont have a goal and i dont know what i wanna be when i grow up. my family always comment on how they have high expectations because of how well i do but it makes me angry because i know if i fail in the future its because i never really was the child prodigy they thought i was, i just had straight a's and the mindset to turn things in earlier rather than later. I feel like an asshole because most people would be proud to  be considered a gifted child. However, when they mention it to me, I always shut them down and get annoyed with their comments.

"title: AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together?
content: I (M27) am married to a man (M28). He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it’s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",nta
"title: AITA for getting my daughter a hotel room entirely for herself after her stepsisters made her sleep on the floor?
content: My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).


While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said ""It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way.."". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm ""playing favorites"" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.

We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.


ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.

Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.



ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.

And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",nta
"title: AITA for getting my girl’s birthday gift reimbursed?
content: My girl wanted an Apple Watch for the longest time. I gifted her an Apple Watch on her birthday along with a Chanel perfume, a birthday dress and took her out for a dinner in an upscale restaurant.
Since I get a fitness reimbursement benefit from my company, I was able to get the Watch reimbursed later on. Did I do anything wrong by doing that? Does that make it less of a gift? We were talking today and I mentioned it to her that I got it reimbursed and now she is is mad at me. She is telling me I cheated out. Did I? I don’t get it. Looking for thoughts!


Edit: I didn’t mention it to her to tell her the value of it. We were buying tennis racquets today and I said “I can get mine reimbursed from the company. I get that benefit and can reimburse sports/fitness related stuff like I got the Apple Watch last year” Honestly I didn’t think it was going to be a big deal.",nta
"title: AITA for getting my interviewer fired?
content: I (f27) went to a job interview for a potential job opportunity at this company. The interviewer, we'll call him ""Eddie"" (30ish) welcomed me into the office and had me sit down. First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was ""real"" or just 'lenses"", also asked about how I spend my time when ""alone"" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying ""keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!"". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an ""attitude"". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.

I went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I ""ruined"" it for myself and cost him his job.

"title: AITA for getting my sister arrested?
content: To preface this, my sister (27f) is a POS, she gave me (20F) years of childhood trauma and is genuinely an awful person. She does however have 4 children, all of which I love and care for massively which complicates things. 

Not long ago, I found out my sister was driving around in her boyfriends car - she doesn’t have a driving license and as a result no insurance. She has never had professional lessons, is irresponsible and there has been numerous occasions someone has ‘crashed into’ their car.

We had caught her driving around multiple times alone, she would always deny it. But I reached breaking point when I once spotted her driving around with two of my young nieces in the back. Neither her or her partner have a job and all children live within a 2 minute walking distance to their school. To me, there is no reasonable explanation to put her kids at risk for this.

So I called the non-emergency police line and reported her anonymously. A few days later she was arrested, I don’t know what fines or punishment she has been given as a result.

She has guessed it was me, since I have pulled her up on it before. It’s caused a huge argument in the family where, of course, she wants to stop me seeing my nieces and nephew. 

My mum was upset at finding out she was driving, but it feels like she is angry at me for reporting her and causing all this drama - like she wished that my sister just got caught on her own doing. Was I wrong to report it? Should I have just let it run it’s course? 

TL:DR; I caught my sister driving uninsured and without a license and reported it to the police. She was arrested and now it’s caused a huge argument in the family. Should I have just minded my own business?",nta
"title: AITA for getting my twin nieces “unfair” birthday gifts?
content: 
So, the other day, my (35m) twin nieces (Aria and Nina) had their twelfth birthday. For Aria, I got her an art bag (basically a small tote with hard backing and different sections and pockets) filled with art supplies. Colored pencils, watercolors, markers, sketchbooks, etc. Basically, a young artist’s cornucopia. For Nina, I bought some new softball supplies. New cleats, a batting helmet, twelve new softballs (she loses hers really easily), and a metal bat. 

When the girls were unwrapping their presents, they both loved them. My sister (the twins’ mom) shoots me a weird look, but I think nothing of it. Later, my sister gets me alone and confronts me about getting Aria “more things” than Nina. I respond that I tried to gear the gifts towards the girl’s individual interests. She said that that doesn’t matter, that Aria got more things (she did get more individual items) and that that wasn’t fair. 

I actually added up the total costs later because I was feeling unsure, and the two gifts were of similar cost (actually, Nina’s gift was $20 more expensive iirc). I did inform my sister of this. Still, she’s been cold to me since then, which is weird because we’re normally quite close. This is having me feeling even more unsure.

"title: AITA for getting pissed because they keep cancelling our plans for a girls vacation?
content: So I've lived in Japan for 4 years now, and my friends have been saying that they are planning to visit for a girls vacation. But every year there's always a problem so no one gets to go. One year corona hits, the next they don't have enough money, the next they're busy with work. And honestly I really was understanding ""oh that sucks... okay it's fine!!""

But last year they assured me that they'll be REALLY visiting this year. I was like ""I don't know.. I don't want to get my hopes up over and over just for you guys to cancel..""  they were like ""nahh we'll fr be going next year!!""

Then comes today, a text. I knew it. They are cancelling it again.. this time it's because one of the girls mom wanted to go on a vacation with her for her 50th bday, so she won't be able to afford to go to visit me. 

I am really mad at her right now, gave her the cold shoulder. But I really feel like I'm being an asshole, cuz it's not like she wanted to cancel. 

AITA for being pissed??

EDIT: for all the people getting mad at me. I DO visit them every year. Even when corona started. Also I'm not even mad they cancelled it, it's just I KNOW they'll keep on saying that they'll come is what pisses me off I guess. Also I'm not blaming covid on my friends, I just listed it in there as one of the reasons why they can't come. I didnt expect them to come during covid obviously.",yta
"title: AITA for getting someone’s Mercari account closed
content: Long story short- I purchased a sold out pair of shoes from a seller on Mercari. The item was listed as a size 8 men 10 women and it was listed approx $150 below the only other size 10 and it was brand new so figured it was a steal. I immediately buy them, it takes longer than usual for the seller to ship, so long that i received a notice from Mercari saying the seller has not shipped and if I wanted to I could cancel the purchase. Reached out to the seller who told me they were having personal problems financially & in the middle of an eviction with a kid and were distracted but would ship that day. She/he didn’t ship that day, 4 days later she/he shipped. Received the item it looks new as described but it is a size 7 men 9 women NOT a 8m/10w that was listed. Contacted the seller immediately and their response was you got a good deal wear it and it will stretch. Explained I didn’t want to do that and wanted my money back, seller sent “shrugs” emoji. Contacted Amex, got my money back asap. Contacted Mercari and after sometime got a message saying they credited my account and have removed the seller and I could keep the shoes or send it back but on my dime. I kept the shoes and I’m currently wearing them.",nta
"title: AITA for getting too drunk at a wedding and wanting to leave early?
content: My boyfriend (27M), “T,” and I (25F) attended the out-of-state wedding of his former colleague and good friend. I wasn’t originally planning on attending due to school, but my schedule cleared up and I knew that it would mean a lot to him if we went together.

The ceremony was nice, and I met some of T’s high school friends. I didn’t know many people at the wedding, and those I did know happened to be part of the same sorority I dropped out of in college, so honestly I felt out of place. Once the ceremony ended we had about 3 hours of free time. T, his friends, and I all went out for some drinks. Admittedly, I drank a little too quick to compensate for feeling anxious, but afterwards I became a social butterfly. The reception began, and I had many meaningful conversations with various wedding guests.

Unfortunately, I started feeling sick after eating dinner, so I quickly went to the bathroom to sit on the toilet and recuperate. After 10-15 minutes I came back out, and I was even able to play off my long absence as giving advice over the phone to my distressed sister who coincidentally got too drunk at a bar (this actually happened on my way out of the bathroom). I danced for a little bit, then hung back because I felt overheated. T, on the other hand, was tearing up the dance floor. It made me happy to see he was having fun, so I still enjoyed myself.

By the end of the reception, I was exhausted as we had been at the gathered for nearly 10 hours. T’s friends said goodnight and went back to their hotel, and I wanted to do the same. However, the bride, her family, and her close friends were headed up to the roof for afters. I knew that T would want to join (he likes to hang out until the very end of a social gathering, while I run out of social energy much quicker than him), so I offered to Uber home while he stayed back to hang. I figured this was quite fair, since I wasn’t asking him to cut his time short having fun or anything.

However, T got visibly upset and after a bit of coercion, convinced me to go upstairs with them. We ended up seated at a table fighting for the rest of the night because I wanted to leave after the reception ended. Tears were shed, harsh words were exchanged, and after an hour and a half, everyone left so we Ubered home.

I think T was mostly upset because I got too drunk and he was worried what other people thought, but I don’t think anyone was even paying mind to us since it was someone else’s big day. I was very upset that T forced me to stay past the reception just so he could drunkenly yell at me for wanting to leave. I’m wondering after all of this… AITA?",info
"title: AITA for getting upset about a comment made about my teeth?
content: I (28f) had dental trauma when I was younger and had to get 2 crowns on my teeth. I had to have root canals because the nerve was dead and my 2 teeth are a different shade compared to the rest of my teeth. This has always been an insecurity of mine and I was bullied severely because of it. 

My bf (28m) doesn't know what happened because I don't speak about it.  We were discussing the costs of cosmetic dentistry and he asked why I would like to have it done and I explained why, then he commented that he did notice something was ""odd"" about my teeth but didn't want to mention it. 

I got SO upset and started to cry, he apologised but I still feel very hurt and it brought up so many bad memories of being bullied. I feel like ""odd"" was the wrong choice of words to use even though he didn't know the nature of the situation. I wanted some space to myself to process how I feel after these bad memories resurfaced. AITA for getting upset over his comment?",yta
"title: AITA for getting upset after my brother's friends trespassed?
content: For context: we live in an apartment building and have a dog. He's taken daily up on the roof to run and exercise every morning. We also live on the highest level so the roof is just the next flight of stairs.

I (18f) came home from a long errand run today to find my brother (14m) with a group of his friends with our dog on the roof of our apartment building. My brother and his friends had a test today and his school is very near where we live so they usually hang out after for a bit. Today is the first time they actually enter the building and even go up the roof with him. He claims they wanted to see our dog and hang for a bit. It was all no problem until this happened.

When I came up and noticed the roof door unlocked, I went up, saw them and waved before I told my brother I'm heading inside & not to stay for too long because of the heat and our dog (it was almost 1 pm and the sun was too hot). This is important later.

 Time pass and he's back down home way after I had went in. The door opens and in comes my brother with our dog tho I never hear the door close again so I walked out to see what was going on as I heard a ruckus in the kitchen after. He tells me his friends want some water so he gets out five glasses for each of them. The problem started when I stood near because our dog has a thing for running out whenever the door opens and my brother had the glasses in hand. I was by now in my pajama pants and a thin tank top, of course in the comfort of my own home. That's when I noticed his friend, a boy his age, poking his head inside. I think nothing of it and hide a little behind and assume he just wanted to get the glass of water so it doesn't fall or something. Call me conservative but I wasn't properly clothed enough to be seen and it's MY home. My brother leaves the door ajar so he can get the rest of the glasses for them. That's when the damn door opens! At first, I try not to assume and think it's the wind (even tho it's hot outside with no wind) but I peek while holding my dog back and one of his friends, a girl this time is stepping in like it's a public park.

So loudly, I ask ""What is this?"" a couple of times and even then they didn't stop so that's when my brother rushed and said ""one second"" and closed the door again. I look at him, bewildered, and ask him what the hell was that?
He looks at me and goes ""None of your business.""

How is it not my business? My parents aren't home at the time but I am and they surely know it because I saw them and they saw me up in the roof (they were the one to tell my brother your sister came for heaven's sake).
He's making me feel like I'm making it a big deal. My dad is on my side saying it shouldn't have happened. I don't know, but I think it's common courtesy, even if I was properly fully dressed, not to enter someone's house unless invited in. I mean, my brother told them to wait outside for a reason. So, AITA?

Edit: I think I should add that the apartment is my parents' legally. In my country it's not common for kids to move out when 18. It's until marriage or other things that require it like college in another place for example. No, my parents never allowed him to bring his friends *inside*. No, I can't go to my room for privacy because one, my room is actually shared between me and my brother so it could be 'it's my room too' and two, I was holding the dog back because he couldn't. In my culture, it's not really appropriate to enter one's home without invitation and there's no garden or terrace or anything like that. Besides, again, I wasn't fully dressed. I don't know if that's just irrational middle school behavior of them, but still. My brother has had a LOT of group friends over the years. This one is by far the second worst tbh in regards of manners and my parents and some extended but close family members agree. My brother just can't accept any criticism on them apparently.",yta

content: So my (24 F) fiancé (28 M) has two jobs currently - he’s a director of social and community services during the day, and a bar DJ at night. I try to be as supportive as possible because I know he’s working a lot, and I’ll allow him to take my car since it’s bigger and he can load up his equipment. This weekend he was DJ’ing the club on Friday night, and doing a private event Saturday mid-noon. He asked to borrow my car for the Friday night and I allowed him to. He was in a hurry the next morning to leave for his next gig, so I didn’t get a chance to speak to him. That morning when I checked, my car was still in the driveway and he’d taken his car. I had made plans that morning to spend time with friends, so I took a shower and got ready. A few hours later , I stepped outside and my car was gone. At first I panicked because I thought my car was stolen, but after a few phone calls and speaking with his assistant , I found out my fiancé came back to the house and took my car. Mind you, he never texted or called me to let me know he was taking my car. I was upset because I had already made plans with friends, and now I couldn’t go, because I was stuck at the house with no transportation.

My fiancé argued that I let him use the car last night, and I should’ve known better that his equipment would’ve still been in my car and he needed to take it. I then brought up that he ended up taking both cars and asked him why that was necessary, but I didn’t really get a straight answer from him. He then proceeded to tell me that I never do anything on the weekends and I should’ve communicated that I needed my car that day, but I don’t think I need to ask to use my own car. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for getting upset with my husband after he told me nothing will change while I am pregnant?
content: Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call ""Jake"" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok.

My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok.

"title: AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?
content: I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. 

While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.

So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". 

Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for giving away the coffee machine my parent's got me(them) as a ""gift""
content: I(21m) don't drink coffee or alcohol or anything caffeine. Not because of some straight edge stance. I've done substances/drank in the past. I just don't really vibe with caffeine or alcohol. The fun part about substances is doing them rarely. I don't want an artificial boost of energy or consistent drunk/tipsyness. Just not my thing. I'm the guy at the bar ordering juice.

I moved into my own place not long ago. I was renting a room in on a friend's property but now I've got my own place. Also it is important to note that I play in a small alt/punk band. I'm not here to promote so I won't name it but I tour the country and other countries. It's nothing glamorous. I make enough to get by and if I am not touring for a bit I do seasonal jobs or Uber. I've got my own place and had my parents over a few times and each time they made comments about their being no coffee. So I bought some instant coffee packs but they scoffed at those. Recently they came by with a ""gift"" and it was a fancy ass coffee machine. Which I have no room for. They know I don't drink coffee but they still got it for them. I told them I have no room for it. My closet and storage space is already limited. I'm one of the few members of the band with a steady place to live so I keep instruments and amps here. Also I am on the road a lot and end up eating cheap shitty fast food or microwaved frozen stuff. So when I am home I enjoy cooking and I have real cooking gear. Blenders, food processors, stand mixers etc. Eating fresh baked bread after being on the road for a while is great. I don't even have a spot on my counter I can just leave this fancy ass coffee machine.

I told my parnets i have no place to keep it and it is just getting in the way. They kept brushing it off. I offered to give it back to them and they brushed it off. So I gave it away to a friend that would actually use it. The last time my parents came over they saw and were pissed off. Saying it was rude and asking me to pay them what they paid for it. I refused",nta
"title: AITA for giving him my number
content: thowaway becuase reasons  


I (25F) was taking a bus home from work(about 30 min) and got into a conversation with a guy sitting a couple seats away from me. He seemed OK and the conversation felt natural so I really didn't mind. After a while he asked for my phone number, and while the guy was kinda cute, I'm really not looking for someone rn so I knew we're not gonna go out, but we both had at least 20 minutes on the bus, and I figuered rejecting him would make it really awkward. So I gave him my number and we continued chatting for a while, and when we got to our stop I told him I'm in a rush and took off.  


A few hours later he sent me a message asking if I want to grab a cup of coffee, and I said no. Next day I told this story to a friend and she said I was kind of a bitch for giving him my number when I had known I'm not interested, but personally I think both of us would be uncomfortable either way, and besides I don't owe the guy anything. He iniciated the convo going that way so I'm not resposible to make him feel good about it. I had a few shitty experiences with guys not reacting well to being told ""no"" and I really didn't want to go through that there.",yta
"title: AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?
content: I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

"title: AITA for giving my friend a mother's day present without consulting her husband?
content: My best friend had her first baby, my godchild, 4 months back. She had a rough childbirth and was bedridden for several weeks after. Her mom and in laws have moved in with them or close by to help with childcare. But she has been complaining about feeling emotionally neglected and underappreciated. Everyone is focused on the ""precious"" baby and she feels like her only worth is that of the cow that produces its milk. She might be slipping into ppd (undiagnosed). Her husband helps a bit with childcare but it's a flip of a coin if he'll show up for her emotionally. For the most part he hasn't. He just doesn't get what she has been through and is going through. 

This weekend, I ordered a mother's day self care package for my mom and had an extra one shipped to my friend. I added a gift note thanking her for giving me the world's cutest godchild and for everything she has done for us. It was meant to be a gift from me - her friend - to celebrate her new journey as a mom. 

The gift was delivered early. She was very happy to receive it. She knew it was from me. 

But here's the problem - the gift box apparently had a message printed on it from a child to its mother (thank you mom or I love you mom or something similar). Her husband saw it and texted me telling me it was not cool that I bought a gift for his wife on his child's behalf without consulting him. Buying a gift on his baby's behalf was his right. I clarified that the gift was from me, and this was not a competition. He could get her gifts on his behalf and on the baby's behalf on Sunday. 

And I said I hadn't zoomed in on the picture of the box to read the message printed on it when I was ordering it online. But he wasn't having it. He said it was an asshole move meant to undercut him. So AITA?

"title: AITA for giving my keys to my child?
content: So, I (34F) have a 1 year old son. I was lucky enough to go to Philly due to some work training. Since I was staying for about 6 weeks I was able to stay in a sort of studio-like hotel room. I thought the room was very nice and I told my mom and sister that they should stop by for the weekend and we could explore some fun things to do in PA. 

My mom said she would bring my son as well, which of course was very exciting for me. 

I am a parent who feels like kids are meant to explore and that is why we baby-proof things. 
Anything I don’t want my son to have I keep away from him. 

While in the hotel room, my son picked up my lanyard with my keys. He has done this many times before and so I know he likes to chew on the lanyard and I do not mind it. I have literally bought toys that are just a bunch of random household objects attached to a cube. (Like keys, a knob, a light switch, a tiny wheel, a fidget spinner…etc)

My sister (42F) took the keys from him and he started crying. She then tossed them to me and said I should be wary of my keys because a kid could easily lose them. I told her I understand that but that the only key that matters on there is the car key because everything thing else isn’t being used. So I took my car key off and gave the lanyard back to my son to play with. 

Obviously, my son would be hesitant to head back over to his aunt with the lanyard and as he was walking back towards her, she said she wouldn’t have let him have it and looked at him directly and said “If you come back over here, I’m taking it from you” which I found a bit irritating since I gave MY keys to MY child. And so I responded by saying, “Well, their my keys and my kid”

Which apparently was a horrendously disrespectful thing to do according to my mom and sister because he was wary of her afterwards. (temporarily) However, in my opinion, he was doing nothing wrong with the keys and I had no problem with it so what is the big deal? I may have said it a bit annoyed but I didn’t think it was that serious. 


AITA?

Edit:
Just wanted to add that my sister was fuming for about 5 to 10 minutes and then left for two hours. So, literally my son didn’t want to be around her for 10 minutes tops. Once she was back everything was fine.",nta
"title: AITA for going home after I got told to sleep on the floor?
content: 

I'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend ""Carl"" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. My husband sometimes calls Carl his ""nicotine"" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.


Unfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. 

We planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.

My husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull ""Carl is a widower"" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.

They got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.",info
"title: AITA for going into the ladies room?
content: I am a 31 yo man and was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do. I went over to the restrooms and saw that there wasn't a family/companion restroom, just a men's and women's. I went into the men's room and saw there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn't have a counter either.

I walked out and hunted down an employee to ask where the changing table was. She said it was in the bathroom, and I asked where, assuming there was a family/companion restroom on the other side of the store. She took me back to where I just was. I asked if there was another bathroom, and she said no. I told her I was just in the bathroom and there was no changing table. She asked if I was sure and suggested I look again.

I was annoyed, but I went back in the men's room. No changing table. When I came out the employee was gone. Keep in mind, my son has been in his poopy diaper this whole time. So I give up and head into the lady's room which sure enough had a changing table. There was a woman in there washing her hands, and she said ""wrong bathroom, buddy.""

I gestured to my son and said ""no changing table in the men's room."" She laughed and said ""bro, that sucks."" Then she walked out. So I rush to change him, hoping to be done before anyone else walked in. I'm almost done when a woman walks in and starts screaming at me. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she kept screaming ""Get out! You can't be here!"" Then she ran out.

I finished putting the diaper on and rushed out of the bathroom. I saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his carseat and left.

My wife said I absolutely did the right thing, but my mom said I'm an idiot and was 100% in the wrong. My sister won't stop laughing at me and is no help at all. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for going shopping without my wife?
content: Today I had the day off, and my wife and I planned to go clothes shopping for our daughter (2mo). My wife had a morning appointment, so the plan was for me & my daughter to take the train to meet her and then we'd go shopping.

The start of my journey is all going well until my baby starts some intense crying. I'm standing outside the station by my house, trying a few different things to settle her and getting increasingly exasperated, and I text my wife this. She replies she'll meet me at a different station halfway to the store. I don't know exactly when her appointment will be over, but I'm concerned about how long this baby-settling is taking, so I text my wife back to say she might need to wait for us. My exact words are ""might be waiting a while"".

Ten minutes later, I have settled the baby and got onto a train, and I look at my phone again. There are seven texts from my wife, getting mad at me for being vague, asking what's going on, and then saying she's leaving to go home.

I text her back saying to meet us at the station as planned, and she refuses. She is super angry, saying that ""might be waiting a while"" is vague, and means that the plan is off, so she came to help me (this doesn't make sense to me because she went home, but last I told her I was at the station). She keeps calling me and yelling, which is disturbing my daughter who is napping, so I hang up and text her. We argue while I travel on the train to our original meeting point, with me saying let's continue with the plan, and her refusing and saying I've screwed her over and I should come back.

I arrive at the meeting point (15 mins have elapsed since I asked her to wait). She calls me again and is yelling asking why don't I understand what I've done wrong. She says she couldn't just wait an unspecified amount of time for me, that I have broken her heart because she was looking forward to this and I have ruined it. I say we can wait here for her, or she can catch us up, and I apologize for being vague. She still refuses, saying it's too late (she's maybe 20 mins behind us now).

I'm halfway to the store and this is the only day I have to do this, so I continue on, still urging my wife to catch up with us. She's saying I am taking this from her and should have turned around. Eventually I get to the store, buy some things, have a nice time with my daughter and we head home.

My wife is obviously fuming, and has still not given up on this ""you think you did nothing wrong!"". I apologize again, although honestly I do not think I did anything wrong. It wasn't a detailed text, but I was wrangling a screaming baby, and was available to explain further just 10 mins later. Abandoning the plan based on that text seems like an unjustified reaction to me, and it was this and her own stubbornness that caused her to miss the shopping trip. I do not understand her position at all. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for going to a Mexican restaurant while having a bellpepper allergy?
content: 
A lot of people in my family have this bellpepper allergy so we learned to live around it, and it is mostly easy with sometimes the exception of eating out. In my city there are a few Mexican restaurants where bellpeppers are used often, so we call first and tell them about the allergy, asking if it is possible to eat there, they say yes and when we are there they give me/us a menu where is indicated what we should not order and there are still like 5 to 10 options, no biggie. 

A few weeks ago I had a party with some friends in another city, everyone likes mexican so we called ahead like a month before, getting a reservation and letting them know about our allergies (got a friend with another allergy). Everything was cool, they could accomodate us. Except for when we arrived it was suddenly a problem. They had nothing without bellpepper. I don't want to be a burden, thats why I always call ahead, because it always gives me anxiety if cooks have to do something different for me specially without notice. But they had like no options. Eventually they could make me something vegetarian and simple and I was very ok with it, glad that I could at least eat something and didnt held op everyone elses food anymore. Also it tasted very good and I let them know it. I did got told by the waiter: 'This is a mexican restaurant, Mexicans eat bellpepper', in an annoyed tone. 

I brought it up in my family and with other friends over the last couple weeks and opinions are divided, some say that I shouldnt go to a mexican restaurant with this allergy, others say I did everything I could and they told us they could accomodate us. I think I'm not an asshole, but will accept my judgement.

So.. Am I the Asshole for going to a Mexican restaurant while I am allergic to bellpeppers?",nta
"title: AITA for going to a Taylor swift concert?
content: Hello all! Some context here, my partner and I are both 25 year old women and identify as queer. We have been together about a year and half. I am a huge Taylor swift fan. Ever since I was 12 years old, she has been my absolute favorite. When we first started dating, my partner had no interest in Taylor swift but as we have been dating and she has listened to more of Taylor’s music, my partner is now a fan as well. Well tickets went on sale for the ERAs tour and we tried to get tickets but were ultimately not able to get tickets. Taylor swift is going to be in my city for three nights btw. My partner and I discussed maybe we could maybe try to get tickets the week of, but obviously that wouldn’t be guaranteed. 

Well a few weeks ago was one of my friends birthdays. Her parents surprised her with two tickets to Taylor swift. My friend so graciously invited me to go with her, which I replied of course I will go. The tickets would be completely free of charge to me.

Well I tell my partner about this invite and she gets VERY VERY upset with me. She tells me that it is hurtful that I didn’t even talk with her before saying yes. I tried to tell my partner that Taylor swift would be in town for three nights so there would still be opportunity for a last minute ticket. Well my partner did not like this answer. For the past three weeks, she has brought it up multiple times. Ultimately, I don’t see accepting my friends invite to go to the concert as a problem as my partner and I do not even have tickets to go and my partner is only very recently a fan.

The other day my partner brought it up again and I said, “look I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” And basically that I was going to go to the concert and this kinda feels like my partner is trying to control me. And my partner shared how she feels I’m not being empathetic and she is so hurt that she just needs space. 

Well I feel horrible and want to make things better, but I feel like she just wants me to say that I’m not going. I feel like the only way my partner will move on from this is with a genuine apology or me saying I won’t go but that is something I can’t give her right now.

content:   I had been dating my bf for 8 months. When he shipped to boot he gave my number to his mom and asked that she and I keep in contact with each other and also asked me to write every day. His mom and I would text when we’d receive letters from him. One day she texted me and told me she didn’t think I should go to his graduation. It hurt me a lot. I took a few hours to respond and said that I understood her opinion and explained that my bf had been asking me for months before shipping to please go to it and in all his letters kept asking if I was going. Every time I said yes. The mom’s response was very cold. After 12 weeks it was graduation time and my first solo trip to see him. When I got to the air bnb, that the mom suggested I stay with them at, she was exceptionally cold towards me. And I could just feel how much she hated me (this was our first time meeting) example when I wasn’t in the living room mom would whisper horrible nasty things about me to the grandma (the house had great acoustics) there was one time the mom wanted to go for a walk and whispered to the maternal grandma that she though she should ask me to go but really did not want me to “AT ALL” but sent the maternal grandma to ask me. I had to attend my online class so I apologized and said I couldn’t. The grandma walked out and said, “see it pays to be nice, she can’t go.” The next day, Family Day was great, it was great hugging him and spending those few hours of leave with him. Before he went back to his platoon, he hugged me and said, “i love you” and i responded “aww i love you too” 

The next morning was graduation. It was great to watch. However, I never got alone time with him after. Then suddenly at 11pm the dad pulled me aside and told me I was no longer welcome there. I was floored. I was supposed to travel home with them and spend 4 days with my bf in his hometown. The dad told me no. I asked what I was supposed to do, dad said it wasn’t his problem. I had to try to figure out how to change my flight, hotel, rental car everything. I’ve taken a big financial hit for it. I threw all my stuff in my suitcase and as I was leaving the mom was just glaring at me from the couch. I never saw my bf. Idk where he went. I texted him about an hour later but never got a response. Then i was alone thousands of miles away from home. I’ve never been so scared.

Apparently (according to a message a mutual friend got from my bf) his mom told him I was extremely disrespectful to her and their entire family. I have racked my brain trying to think when that could’ve happened. I always asked if anyone needed help among other things. I tried sitting out in the living room to be social but I was generally ignored by the mom and maternal grandma so eventually just stayed in my room.

So AITA for going? What did I do wrong? i don’t know why he was suddenly so cold to me after we had such a great time on family day",nta
"title: AITA for going to the police over a 'prank'
content: Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",nta
"title: AITA for going wedding dress shopping with future MIL and SIL, but not my Mother?
content: I admittedly have put on weight over the past few years. I'm not huge, but I definitely recognize it, and it's made me extremely self-conscious about what I wear and have breakdowns because of it. My mother has not helped this situation, though. She makes small comments and consistently talks about losing weight. She says someone asked her if I was expecting one time. So instead of just telling the lady no. She comes and pinches a couple of fat spots on my body and tells me someone thought you were expecting. She says she just doesn't want me to go through what she went through, and she doesn't mean to be hurtful at all. 

My wedding at the time of all this was 6-8 months away. I asked my mom to go wedding dress shopping, but she said I should wait to get closer to my goal weight, okay fine. Next, one day we were out shopping and I decided to make an appointment at a dress shop that same day, but she again said no. Lastly, while me and my fiance and I are out with his sister and family along with their friends. They asked how it's going so I asked my mom again. She responded and said, ""I'm not going to like the way they look on me and that I'm going to be discouraged with how they fit. I couldn't hold it any longer and started to cry. I tried so nobody would see me, but my suture SIL saw and consoled me. She said that we could have a girls' day and she'll take me. At this point, my anxiety is through the roof, with even being able to get a dress. 

What we decided was that I was going to have a girls' day with my future SIL, MIL, and my 2 future nieces. Im very close with them and feel a part of their family already. They just wanted me to finally feel special through this process because I nor fiance have through this process. I did on that day. Not thinking I was going to buy one, I found one that made me feel like a bride, and I loved it. I purchased it and made a plan that my mom wouldn't know it was bought prior to her seeing it. 

Things ended up happening where she found out. After finding out my mother texted me very upset and immediately started blaming me and that she'll never see my future MIL and future SIL the same because that is a special moment for mother and daughter. She even unfriended them on facebook... she says that I take everything the wrong way and that I've been a drama queen recently. Also, I've put my insecurities onto her. I know that I haven't been myself recently due to a lot of stress after being laid off. I recognized that and apologized to her for that. She says she doesn't know if she'll be at the wedding and absolutely won't be helping in any other way. Im completely heartbroken, and I'm terrified of the future family dynamic between our two families. There is a part of me who wants to call off the wedding as a whole so that my fiance and I can just go somewhere ourselves to be married. 

My mother is not a bad mother by any stretch, but like anyone has her flaws.

I shake the bf hand as I know him (not enough to say we’re friends but we’re cool) I say hey to Jen and we make our way to the back. I only talked to Jen and her bf as they were the only people I knew. Jen talked to me a lot thru the night and we cracked jokes and jus talked. I kept feeling like her bf was subtly pushing me to the outskirts of the group and would stand between me and Jen at times. I I blew it off. If he feels like I’m third wheeling I’ll give them the space. Everytime he’d try to be I guess romantical she would just make a face and laugh it off. 

night continued, slow songs come on and I stepped back to let the couples dance as I’m lonely. They start slow dancing for a bit while I sit on my phone. Jen suggests we make a circle and all dance together and goes to grab my hand to include me. He intercepts the hand and grabs mine instead. He grabs another guys hand and us three dance. We all laughed and kept it going but it felt like he didn’t want me to touch her at all. I blew it off because if he doesn’t want me to then it is what it is.

As me and Jen talk, he continues to subtly push himself between me and her. I made sure not to stand too close to her as I didn’t want to seem like I’m stealing her from him. When he slid between us I’d do something else. He eventually told her we should get some drinks and grabbed her hand and walked off quickly. She turned to wave me over but at that point I took the hint. He didn’t want me hanging with his gf. he walked off very quick and didn’t look back. I told her I’d hang back. 

I went back to hanging with my sister and her friends and Jen texted me immediately saying how she’s sorry they left so quick. I was hanging with my sisters group so I don’t see the text. She rushes up to me and says she leaving and to get home safe and she’ll see me at school. I dab her up and she runs back to her group. As they are walking out, she waves bye, I notice that her bf doesn’t even glance in my direction. 

At the beginning of the dance he would talk and joke with me but by the end it almost seemed like he was sick of my presence. I felt weird but didn’t say anything to Jen as it’s not my place. I could’ve been third wheeling but If I was Jen would’ve said something but she seemed to like talking to me and was including me in everything. I thought maybe he thinks I was trying to make a move on his gf. I wasn’t. We’re friends. I’d never try to break them up and I doubt she likes me. All we did was joke and talk. It didn’t seem like she was trying to hit on me so I don’t see any problem.

"title: AITA for having a beer with a friend, while my pregnant wife was waiting for me ?
content:  Throwaway for privacy, english is not my first language so sorry for the errors   
  I (M24) am married with Tina (26F) and we are expecting a baby, she is 11 weeks. Unfortunately, pregnancy is very hard for her, I try my best to support her the best I can, but to be honest our marriage isn't at its best at the moment, we had several arguments since the pregnancy. 

  
  She works at home and feels a bit lonely sowants me to stay with her as often as possible. So since the beginning of the pregnancy, I just go to work and stay at home with her. She doesn't feel comfortable going out because of the baby weight. It is not a perfect situation but I understand.  


&#x200B;

Sometimes I like to have a glass of wine at dinner or a beer in front of the game but Tina has asked me to stop because the smell of alcohol makes her nauseous, no problem.   
  Yesterday, in the afternoon my friend Matt called me if I could help him because he has a problem with his water supply (I am quite handy with housework, my father is a plumber so I help my friends sometimes). I asked Tina if I could go, she wasn't very hot but I insisted and told her it won't take long, and accepted. 

&#x200B;

  
  I went to Matt's and we managed to fix the issue, he offered me a beer and I accepted, we sat and talked a little because it was quite long time we didn't hang out together, it was a good moment.  Before coming back I took a chewing gum to not smell beer too much. 

&#x200B;

  
  I came home and when I kissed Tina, she smelled the beer and blowed up, she said I was a huge cunt, for abandoning her and the baby to get drunk with my friend and that I was  very inconsiderate with  her nausea problems. I answered that I only took one beer and I was just gone for 2 hours, I told her that she is controling. She was very angry, she said I was a shit husband and if I don't change I will be a shit father. I chose to going out and have a little breath because I was really shaken up.    
  She has been giving me the silence treatment since and I slept on the couch. I also received angry texts by MIL and SIL, they say I am asshole for not supporting Tina. I feel bad because I really try to do my best for Tina and our baby but I'm struggling too, and I honestly don't think sharing a beer with Matt was being incosiderate.

"title: AITA for having a go at our Maid of Honour?
content: Back story: me (28m) & my SO (25f) got married a few days ago. The Maid of Honour (MoH) (26f) & Best Man (BM) (40m) are our closest friends, & are in a relationship together. She has a child (3m), who we asked to be ring bearer (RB), from an old relationship, but BM has raised him as his own. MoH disallows photos of RB online, which we understand & respect. MoH is pregnant, and expecting in 2 months.

When my SO asked MoH to be MoH, over a year ago, MoH seemed excited about it all. MoH was left to plan SO’s hen party, with bridesmaids to help. A month before the wedding, one of SO’s cousins, who is a bridesmaid (CO), told SO that MoH has made no plans. Due to panic of a deadline to sort something, CO took over all planning.

Cue argument between SO, MoH, and CO; MoH apologised and promised to step up. SO spoke to MoH and said that if MoH can’t fulfil her roles, due to pregnancy or money, then it’s not an issue; we can help out or, if she wants to, she can step down to bridesmaid or guest.

So fast forward to the hen party, CO has sorted everything and MoH has done nothing. MoH planned on doing a speech at the wedding, but asked CO to do it for her.

Wedding day. BM is very ill but still turns up. MoH and BM are meant to sort some stuff out, but didn’t do anything. BM drinks excessively, making his illness worse. After main course, BM tells me that he’s really ill and thinks he needs to go home. I tell him it’s for the best, as at least he came and spoke to me about it, and I didn’t want anyone else to get sick.

Next thing BM, MoH and RB are outside, so I text BM asking what’s going on, and he replies that they’re all going else RB will play up. No word from MoH, so I text BM asking for MoH to talk to SO. Nothing. So we decide to leave our desserts and go find them. They gave us a cordial goodbye and then left.

Also found out a few days after that MoH messaged our photographers asking for no photos of RB to be posted online (something which they asked us multiple times to sort months ago, which of course we had done). Then we also found out that they spoke to one of the photographers on the day of the wedding, who took a few photos of the three of them, and asked for those photos to be sent directly to them. We had also asked all guests to not post anything to social media before we gave permission, and yet MoH changed her FB photo to a wedding selfie they took straight away.

MoH’s family came up to us after MoH left and apologised for her behaviour. I decided to message MoH and confront her on the issue; but she has been entirely unable to see anything wrong with what she has done. All she keeps on repeating is that it’s HER child, HER right. Which I agree with, but I don’t think that gives her the right to act how she did or to go behind our backs. This makes me question if I should have confronted her.

TL;DR: I feel that MoH let us down & went behind our backs; she thinks she’s done nothing wrong. AITA for confronting her?",nta
"title: AITA for having a party at my apartment while a neighbor was studying?
content: 2 weeks ago a college student that lives to the apartment next door, went door to door to every single apartment on our floor and the floors below and above us to warn each neighbor that she has her college exams coming up and she's studying so we better not have any parties until the end of May. She was somewhat kind and having been through the stress of exams I was compassionate and agreed that I won't have any loud parties but I told her that my birthday is on May 5 and on Friday night I'd probably have a couple of friends over and have some low music.

She got annoyed when I told her that and told me that I better be quiet then. I didn't like her attitude considering the fact that I was trying to be empathetic and also told her I'd not do anything crazy for a party besides low music and some friends over.

On Thursday evening after I came back from work I saw two notes, one on the building entrance and one on the elevator which said ""I'm the college student from floor 7. Please refrain from any kind of social gatherings that might disturb my studying during this stressful time"".

I didn't give much thought to it. I wasn't planning on a party as I said.

On Friday night I had my three closest friends come over. We didn't party. We just chilled at my apartment and had some low music which barely could be heard to my own bedroom let alone next door apartments.

On Saturday morning there was a note on the elevator once again, straight up naming me saying how ""Lady Y from the 7th floor and apartment number X broke the agreement and had a social gathering on Friday night completely disrespecting the stressful time I'm going through. She said she's be discreet but this is not enough. I could still hear some laughs and discussions because I had my windows and my balcony door open and disrupt my peace and focus. Let this be a lesson the next time someone decides to disrespect stressful times like this. You will be called out"".

Certain neighbours defended me and said the college girl was being unreasonable with her demands but other neighbors believe I was an AH and that I should go to a restaurant or a bar instead of having a gathering at my house.",nta
"title: AITA for having my kids wear tie dye when with their dad?
content: I (30 F) my ex-husband (31m). Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. 
He wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.

My ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).
Since my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. 

My girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn’t want to take her favorite shirt over there.

I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be doing this good.

I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.
To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.
We had a “girls” tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. 

The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn’t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.

They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can’t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn’t want them to wear it. 
He called me an A for being petty.
AITA?
Edited to add. 
Thank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.
1) AP stands for Affair partner 
2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.
3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don’t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories. Thank you for the love and support",nta
"title: AITA for having roommate pay for Air conditioner???
content: AITA? My (40 F) son (18 M) was a freshman this year in college and lived in the dorms with a teammate.  About a week after they moved into the dorm in early August his roommates mom bought them a personal air condition and I sent her half of the cost which was $150. The kids used the AC through some of October and again for the last 3 weeks. 

The kids were going to room together with two other teammates (so they could have continued to share the AC), but couldn’t wait until they could find a four bedroom available off campus, so my son and the two other teammates found a place together and texted the roommate over spring break he’ll need to look elsewhere for a place to live as they signed a lease. It was nothing personal just the three other boys wanted to live together.

Anyway, the roommates mom returned $75 to me last week via PayPal… she said it’s a partial refund since her son will take the AC unit to his new apartment. (Apparently the room he found with some upperclassmen doesn’t have AC)

Anyway, I texted her that I paid $150 and expected the full amount if they were keeping it. I think that’s common cents.

She responded that she lessened the amount that because the unit is no longer worth $300 because it’s used and because both boys used and got value from the AC this year. I think they’re just doing this because my son and his friends didn’t want to live with him next year. I suspect his family may live paycheck to paycheck, but it’s just the principle of the matter tbh. 

So AITA? Or is that mom just not cool?

Update: I realize I shouldn’t assume their financial situation, but did because my son has told me his roommate has to text/call his parents to get money if they are going to grab a bite off campus and his roommate donates plasma for money, but maybe he just just does that because he is altruistic or likes it.

I haven’t heard back from the mom since I last told her we should get the full amount back. My son said she works a few part time jobs in addition to her FT job, so she was probably just busy. Will take this posts answers into consideration when I do hear back.",yta
"title: AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team?
content: 
I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. 

Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. 

I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. 

Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing.",nta
"title: AITA for hiding my partner’s phone
content: Hi. My partner (31M) and I (29F) have been together for 2 years and we now have a son (1M). My partner is obsessed with his phone/socmed/yt/tt

We used to argue a lot over his screen time. Like almost 24/7 he’s just on his phone or he’s playing pc games. He knows and he is aware that he is excessively on his phone. This was even before i got pregnant. 

Fast forward to now, our son is very active. Just a few hours ago, our son toppled down a shelf and hurt himself  because my partner wasn’t paying attention. He was just on his phone. There were other times that accidents could’ve been avoided if my partner just paid attention and put down his phone. We’ve talked a lot about him having to put down his phone and give our son his undivided attention because he only spends around 3hours of wake time with our son. But no. He’s just on his phone. I told him that it’s unfair to the child who’s waiting for his father to come home only for him to spend time on his phone. We can’t even have family meals without him staring at his phone! 

I am so fed up at this point. He doesn’t listen to me about putting down his phone. He knows that staring at the screen gives him headaches and deteriorating eyesight.  

Will i be the asshole if i hid his phone for a day? Or at least when he’s home and spending time with our kid. 

More context: partner is working full time. I’m a stay at home mom working to get my PhD. We used to work in the same office, and we brought our bub to work but i wasnt as productive as i used to be in work bec bub was with me 90% of the time. So i had to quit my job and be a sahm.

"title: AITA for how I handled my aunt buying me books?
content: 
I, (F16) recently went on a trip to Boston to celebrate my Uncle’s (Jeff) (29M) graduation. It was a 3 day trip and my mom (F41) and my little brother were going. The trip was on my birthday so everyone decided that after the graduation, we would celebrate my birthday.

Jeff recently got married to a woman (Jenny) (28F) Me and Jenny have always been polite to each other, I don’t consider her close family but I respect her as my uncles wife. 

The first day of the vacation, everyone met together at a restaurant. I  said hi to everyone before sitting down.

Later on the first day on the way to the hotel, we had time to kill so I followed Jenny, Jeff, and my little brother to the bookstore. I picked out two hardcover books and spotted Jenny in line and asked her to hold onto them for me while I go find my Uncle and get permission to buy them. She said okay and I went outside to look, and when I couldn’t find him I asked Jenny where he might be.

She told me she could just buy the books for me, I said she didn’t have to if she didn’t want, and she insisted and said I should consider it her birthday gift to me. I thanked her. I didn’t think there was an issue.

The second day was the graduation. We all met at a breakfast restaurant and ate. After we all finished, Jeff asked what I’d like to do for my birthday and I said something fun, so he suggested the theme park. I said yes, but Jenny said she didn’t like theme-parks and we had to do something else. Jeff was insisting on the theme park, and eventually Jenny got mad and said she had to work and stormed off. 

Once me and Jeff got to the car, I was very excited, but while I was in the car waiting to go my mom walked up and I opened the door, and she started yelling at me for ‘demanding Jenny buy me gifts’. I didn’t know what she meant and she said I had no right to boss my aunt around. I asked her what she was talking about again, and she said the books I forced Jenny to buy. 

I tried to tell her what happened but she walked away. The next time I saw Jenny was at the graduation and asked to speak with her in a quiet area. 
I asked why she lied to my mom about the books, and she said she didn’t think I deserved to go to a theme-park with my horrible attitude.
I explained I thought I had been nice to her and everyone else.

She disagreed and said yesterday at the restaurant i didn’t say hi to her, which she thought was rude because we were family.
I apologized even though I felt like it was weird nonetheless she was so mad, and she never spoke to me at the restaurant to let me know.

She didn’t say anything else and went back to the rest of the family. The rest of the trip I was sad because my mom was upset at me and Jenny didn’t speak to me.

TL;DR: My aunt offered to buy me books during a trip in Boston and she told my mom that I demanded she buy them.

"title: AITA for ignoring an autistic guy on my flight?
content: AITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?

I'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. 
I tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.
 I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating "" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now"" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of "" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me."" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.
 
I feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.",nta
"title: AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?
content: My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’ 

AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can’t forgive her though.",nta

"title: AITA for insisting my boyfriend eat respectfully at a nice restaurant?
content: So my boyfriend (20M), L, and I (20F) have been dating for 7 months. We usually eat take out if we want to get something to eat. However, I recently was promoted so we went to eat at a VERY nice Italian restaurant to celebrate. Like, one with an enforced dress code. 

My boyfriend is not the nicest of eaters, which can be kind of gross but I deal with it. However, I didn’t realize he had no table manners. At the restaurant, after we were served our first appetizer, a beautifully plated bruschetta dish, L looked at me and jokingly asked me if I would be upset if he enjoyed his meal the same way he would at home. I told him that we were at a nice restaurant and there were other customers around. 

He didn’t say anything, but instead started digging into the bruschetta with his hands, ignoring the serving fork, getting sauce all over his fingers. I let this go. However, when the pasta came out, he smirked at me and ate like he hadn’t eaten in a week. 

He dropped his fork and started picking up pieces of chicken and noodles with his fingers, getting sauce everywhere: the tablecloth, his hands, his clothes and face. He didn’t miss the opportunity to loudly burp after he had finished destroying his side of the table. The table next to us was astonished. My waiter even asked him if he was ok. Other customers were staring. He also put his feet up on the chair next to us, blocking the aisle. 

I had no idea what to do. I didn’t want to make even more of a scene so I just asked for the check (which I paid) and left really embarrassed. On the way home I told him how embarrassed I was and he just said that it was my fault for not letting him enjoy the meal as he pleased and that since we were paying customers the other guests had no business judging us.

"title: AITA for insisting my dad pays our dogs surgery bill?
content: My parents got me a female dog about 6 years ago and another male dog a year ago. My parents (f40)(m45) never bothered to spay our female dog so they ended up having puppies. It was a decision my parents approved of, my dad even said he wanted them to have puppies. The night she started birthing, me and my mom were there for her and made sure everything was fine. It was not easy. I was extremely stressed and lost a lot of sleep. My dad got mad at us when we had to feed the puppies when they started whining because the mother was rejecting them. She gave birth to 4 healthy puppies. The day after they were born I realized that one of them couldn't walk and turns out he was born with a twisted limb. We took him to the vet and we were told that the leg needed to be removed. I'm not sure why we waited so long to get the surgery done but the more the puppy grows the more expensive the surgery would be. We got help from an animal care shelter that could help us pay for the surgery and we sold one of the other puppies which left us with 470 dollars, the surgery now costs 600 dollars. For some clarification, any money that we earned from the puppies would be considered my money and would ONLY go to vet expenses or any other expenses that had to do with our dogs. I also want to add that my parents make good money, we are not in any way in poverty but we aren't also rich. So my dads complaining that he has to pay 133 dollars for the puppy's surgery even though I'm already paying most of it and so is the animal care shelter that offered to help us. He wanted the animal care shelter to PAY MORE than what was already offered and that the vet clinic was exaggerating the cost of the surgery. So I decided to call other clinics to see how much they would charge for the surgery and of course, 1000-2500, and that didn't include making an appointment to get the limb checked and xrays before getting a quote for the surgery. I got frustrated with him and told him that if it isn't a problem for him to spend so much money on buying accessories for his cars then he wouldn't have a problem paying 133 dollars for a surgery the puppy needs to walk right. He just ended up leaving the house, my mother will pay for the remaining 133 and I will be paying her back once I get a job in about a month. (I am f16) He wanted these puppies yet he isn't willing to help us sell them or help us pay for the surgery since it isn't a priority or benefiting him in any way. This isnt the first time these types of problems happen. 

My dad has been buying food for the dogs and cleans after them and both of my parents are also paying to get our female dog spayed. Our male dog doesnt need to be neutered apparently??? He wanted her to have pups so we could experience birth. That was his excuse.

"title: AITA for insisting my pregnant sister switch bedrooms with me?
content: Throwaway coz I don’t want it connected to my main. 
My sister and I (both mid-20sF, I’m a few years older) share a house together. It was our parents house and we both inherited it after they died. We have equal share/ownership of the house. 
The house has four bedrooms, one is the master room and has an ensuite and walk in wardrobe, the others three just have built-in robes. 
When we both moved back in after deciding that neither of us wanted to sell, we agreed that she could have the master suite, but the two largest of the other bedrooms would both be mine. One as an actual bedroom and the other as a gaming room for me. The last and smallest bedroom is a guest room.

Her boyfriend’s been living here for a while and she recently told me that she’s pregnant. I’m not particularly looking forward to sharing a house with a screaming baby, but it’s her house too and she has every right to be here and raise her kid. 

Obviously, they baby will need a bedroom, and I was expecting that to be the guest room. It is the smallest bedroom in the house, but it’s still the same size as a standard bedroom. But my sister wouldn’t go for that. She’s insisting I move my stuff out of my games room so that can be that baby’s room. I told her that I’m not moving my stuff into the guest room, because that wasn’t our agreement, but then she informed me that actually, I won’t be able to do that either, as we would still need a guest room, especially with the baby coming as her bf’s family will want to visit. 

So I said fine, you can have my games room, if you move into my room and give me the master room. She started crying and said that as a mother, she’s going to need her own space and she deserves the master bedroom. I asked what she expected me to do, and she said I should just suck it up and keep ‘all my crap’ in my own room. 

We’re at an impasse and I can’t get her to come to a real agreement with me. She keeps calling me a ‘huge bitch’ and says that I should let her have both the master bedroom and my gaming room because she ‘needs them more’ her boyfriend says I should just deal with it, that because I don’t want kids anyway, I should just let suck it up. My girlfriend, who also spends a lot of time here, is on my side and says my sister is being a spoiled entitled little brat. 
AITA?

Edit: she can’t buy me out, she doesn’t have the money. We each got some money along with the house, but she wanted a fancy Range Rover so most of hers went to that and she can’t get a loan because she’s only working part time at macca’s at the moment. 
I still have all of my money plus some of my own savings, so I will be having a discussion with her re buying her out. The house is located in a nice/expensive area, so what she gets from me for her half will be enough for her to buy an average three bedroom house in a cheaper area.

Really really don’t want to sell if I can help it as house has been in the family a long time",nta

"title: AITA for joking about being an orphan in class
content: 
My parents died when I was about 4 years old and close friends of them adopted and raised my twin sister and me. While I am grateful to them, neither of us ever felt part of their family and there was a clear distinction in how they treated us vs their bio kids. Therefore I do not consider them my parents, I do call them that when talking about them but only because ‚the couple that raised me‘ is a bit of a mouthful.

I started uni recently, Sociology. The teacher asked us all to describe our parents in one word and tbh, this is on him, he should have said ‚parents/legal guardians‘ or smth bc I‘m sure I‘m not the only orphan he‘s ever taught. Besides that it felt like an extremely personal question, I was never abused luckily but many people have. Either way, when it is my turn I obviously say ‚dead‘ bc humor is my coping mechanism and my parents are, indeed, dead. The teacher laughed at first (the suprised ‚holy shit what did he say?!‘ kind of laugh‘ and immediately tried to move on lol I do feel a bit bad for putting him on the spot like that but like… should have thought things through, we‘re studying sociology after all lol

After class out of nowhere this girl in my class comes up to us and she is ANGRY. She starts having a go at me, telling me how rude and inconsiderate my comment was and that I shouldn‘t lie bc she saw me with my parents in town. This is hilarious to me bc while she definitely saw me with my adoptive parents, they are asian, I am half black and half white lol I explain they adopted me after parents died and she goes off about how I should honor them and their ‚sacrifice‘ and how she hates seeing ungrateful people like me just toss their adoptive parents aside. In the moment I told her to fuck off and just left but I feel I handled it extremely poorly.

I have since learned that she is adopted and that‘s probably why she was so angry. I also think it was unwise of me to make that joke in class. I was even emailed by the teacher who said that ‚some students‘ complained about my ‚inappropriate comment‘, however I also feel this is a bit ridiculous? Like they asked me to describe my dead parents, who I barely remember. What else am I supposed to say? Some people from that class have also messaged me, either saying I was being an asshole or saying they think I was in the right and that the teacher should have never did that exercise in the first place.

I‘m quite conflicted, so am I the asshole here?",nta
"title: AITA for joking about my friend ignoring her friends in favor of her boyfriend?
content: I (24F) have a very close friend(23F) who recently met a guy and has been dating him for 2-3 months now. Lately I have been feeling very neglected as a friend and ignored in favor of a guy she only knows for a short amount of time in comparison to me and another friend. 

To preface this I usually don’t take things too seriously and like to joke around. I admit that sometimes I may go too far with said jokes and I apologise to everyone when I go too far. However lately I have been commenting on my friends ig posts when she posts pictures of her and her boyfriend on trips etc. things like ‘so this is why you’re ignoring us’ in a joking matter. I even made similar jokes in our group chat. 

She told me to stop making these jokes because it upsets her, at first I didn’t take her too seriously so I continued making said jokes. It’s not like I made them everyday, it was once in a while when she decided to giver her friends a minute of her attention. The last time she told me to stop, I did stop because I didn’t want to continue to upset her. 

A few days ago we were planning on meeting up and I jokingly said that maybe I’ll come or maybe not since I have been invested in playing a game that I have been waiting for. It had nothing to do with her or her boyfriend, but she seemed to think that. Usually I explain myself but I have had enough so I started getting angry. We had a bit of an argument and she told me that she has been pulling away from me because of the jokes that I have been making about her ignoring us, among other things that don’t really pertain to the story. I think that even if you are in a relationship you shouldn’t neglect your friends who have been here for you in times of need. I have always valued friends and family above everything else so maybe its a conflict of opinions. 

I’m not sure that I am the asshole, so I decided to stop lurking and ask reddit. So please tell me  AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for keeping a “point system” with my dad
content: I (17) live with my parents.  As I’m sure most teenagers do, I have my fair share of conflict with my parents.  I don’t think it’s too bad, but definitely on the high end of normal.  Around April (or maybe late March) after a fight with my dad I texted him that for Father’s Day I would get him a gift worth $25.  Every time he did something (for lack of a better word) “wrong” I would text “-$1”.  I did this a few times and my dad would make a big deal of saying “I don’t care”.  Not to sound smug but he clearly did care.  This happened a few times and after one time I texted him “-$1” (nothing else, just that) and him and my mom were very mad at me.  He said it was “obnoxious” and my mom said “no reasonable person would do that”.  She then (smugly) said to ask my therapist what she thought (I’m in therapy mainly for parent-child conflict) and I said “I did and she didn’t have a problem with it”. My mom said “no reasonable person would be okay with that, she just probably didn’t want to have another battle with you”.  I’ve stopped for now because it’s not worth it with my parents, but I really don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here.  

So AITA?

Reason why I’m possibly TA: I know you shouldn’t hold a gift over someone’s head and also that he’s my dad

Edit: the reason I want to do this is because he never wants to talk about our fights.  There have been points where he’s gotten so angry that my mom eventually made him apologize and he never changes.  I’m punished all the time for fights and while I get to an extent there’s a parent child dynamics, nothing ever happens to him and there’s no enforcement so I was trying to “enforce” change here, just as he may punish me and hold my stuff over my head.

Second edit: For those saying that’s not how relationships work, I wouldn’t do this in any other relationship.  My parents are people that, not to sound ungrateful and I do love them, I’m stuck with.  I have some aspect of control in other relationships.  I don’t mean control like I control the other person, I mean it like a relationship works both ways and isn’t a stuck situation.  
*This is the one chance I have to have any kind of voice with my dad that will actually impact him*

"title: AITA for keeping money away from my overspending wife?
content: I’m quite rich, but nearly all of my assets are not on my name, and my wife is seriously obsessed with that, I told her recently how much money I generate per month, it is quite enough to buy small flat every month in my country, I reinvest those money in many different ways, but not in flats(they are overpriced in area where I live now), so we rent a house, I don’t own one. 

Couple of days ago she started demanding to buy new assets on my name so that in case of divorce she can have half of that, which I’m not ok with, not because I’m greedy bastard but because she just blows all the money every time she gets access to them, and we have 2 kids to whom I would want our fortune to pass to when I die, because if my wife gets an access to that she will get all of us broke.

Somehow for last week she became seriously obsessed with money and started to put her nose in my business, which I did not agree to, moreover she was literally forcing me to sell my assets for us to buy luxury apartments and stay with empty funds (forcing hilariously silly financial decisions). That scared me so much that I made her two radical offers despite being together for 9 years

1) she signs marriage agreement where she can not have access to any assets both after and before divorce, but I take her on full sponsorship for the rest of her life, I provide her with property to live and take full sponsorship for children

2) we get divorced, she gets half what I officially have, which is not a lot but I still take care of children financially

So the question is am I the asshole for trying to protect my investments from woman that I love in this manner? I don’t know why we both became highly insecure about our future together especially me, when her obsession led her to stimulating me to work more because as she told “my dad will take care of me and my children if I divorce with you, he will provide me with both luxury flat and car”, basically that was her way of inspiring me to be more ambitious, to which I radically reacted like “fuck it, I’m not going to take this kind of blackmailing, do it, and we will see what happens next”

I’m afraid my wife quickly became gold digger as soon as she realised I make approximately 100 average salaries per month, why didn’t she just keep it as it was?",nta

"title: AITA for kicking my SiL out after she threw away most of my single use baby products and even formula?
content: I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're ""crunchy parents"" to a 8 month old.

Basically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea.

On Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing. 

When I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and ""threw out anything I don't need"". This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us.

I was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items.

My brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?
content: I’ve known James since we were 11. He’s been my best friend for a long time and we’re so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He’s really goofy with me, and treats me like I’m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he’s family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I’ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I’m in the right place in life and I’m so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won’t go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn’t feel like going to the mall, can’t come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

My mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said ‘I know it’s really weird of me but it just creeps me out’ 

I found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m so upset that he’s ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! I want to reach out but I just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and I’m not sure if I’m the one that’s being difficult or if it’s him.",nah
"title: AITA for kicking my mum out?
content: My mother and I have never had a good relationship. She has been emotionally, mentally and verbally abusive towards me my entire life. There are periods when she's calm, and not causing drama and upset. But they never last long, and when she decides to cause heart ache it's so bad that it erases any of the good. My main memories of her are bad. I constantly forgive her (even though she never apologises) and let her back into my life and she always ends up hurting me again.

Anyway, she recently broke her leg, and my brother convinced me to allow her to move into my house so I would care for her. She came with her two, dogs. One is 14 and one is nearly 2.
Her dogs were constantly going to toilet in my house. It was DISGUSTING! I was cleaning dog mess several times a day. The urine was getting inbetween the tiny gaps of my wood flooring. I started to feel filthly and uncomfortable in my own home. 

Her dog also chewed through the pulg on my LED lights and destroyed a photo album of my sons trip to disneyland (it was on the coffee table)
Bare in mind my mum was in the same room as the dog when it happened, she was just too busy watching tv to notice.

The final straw came when her dog pooed on my bed!!!!! Despite me telling my mum to keep her dogs downstairs and not allow them upstairs. My mum was staying downstairs anyway as obviously she can't climb stairs. Anyway, I told her she had to leave, that the mess her dogs were creating in my home was depressing me. She got angry. We argued and then I drove her 3 hours home, in silence.

Now I feel guilty. Maybe if we had a better relationship I would have been more willing to over look the hell her dogs were creating. Idk!?

"title: AITA for kicking my roommate out?
content: My partner and I have been struggling with rent for awhile and I thought that a roommate would help, so I reached out to a friend on FB that needed somewhere to live and offered our second room back in Feb. I didn’t know them very well, but I thought it would be okay since they said they only needed a place until April and I figured we’d all be on our feet by then. I offered to help them pack and move to our place, which is when I noticed their old place was trashed, you couldn’t see a single surface under the mess. But they said their ex-roomie caused the mess and I gave them the benefit of the doubt at the time. My partner and I did most of the packing and moving for the roomie since they were busy with work. 

Things were fine for the first month, we only asked for a third of the rent and didn’t ask them to cover any more of the utilities or house costs. I also didn’t ask them to do any housework besides their own space. 

Then we got notice that there would be an inspection of the apartment. We had a week to clean so I warned the roomie and started cleaning the rest of the apartment. The day before the inspection I checked on roomie’s room to see if it was clean and it looked exactly like their old place, absolutely trashed. I told them I would do most of the cleaning for them while they were at work that day, but they’d need to finish it overnight before the inspection. I checked again the next morning and they hadn’t cleaned at all, I had to finish it literal hours before the inspection. Luckily it was clean enough to not get us in trouble. 

Afterwards I talked to the roomie about keeping the room clean and told them to just ask me if they needed help. They’ve never asked. I’ve cleaned their room two more times since then and every time it goes right back to being trashed. On top of that they keep leaving nasty dishes in the sink and moldy food in the fridge and our electricity bill has more than doubled along with other smaller issues. They didn’t move out in April like they said they would either. 

Today we got a complaint from management saying there was a bad smell coming from our place and it was the final straw. We wrote up an eviction letter and put it on their bedroom door. As soon as they saw it they started screaming at us, calling us heartless and saying we only wanted their money. 

I feel terrible because I know they have nowhere to go but I can’t live like this and the mess is now putting our housing at risk. AITA? Could I have handled this better?",nta
"title: AITA for kicking my sister out of our family dinner after she made a ""practical observation""?
content: My brother 'Fred' and his wife 'Sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'Katie' and I when they announced that they were pregnant. However, we kept it to ourselves. A few months ago, Katie planned a family trip. Brother and SIL decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. This greatly irked Katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that Fred and Sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. This very clearly upset both of them.

Unfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. It has been a month, and my brother and SIL are understandably still devastated. Especially my SIL's mental health is not very well as of now.

Yesterday, I hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, SIL and our parents. Some time before dinner, SIL went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked Fred if she was doing well. Before Fred could reply, Katie jumped in and said, ""Well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. At least you don't have to worry about money anymore. As I said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.""

Fred went red-faced and said that they WOULD have been able to provide for their child. They may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. He was almost crying and purple with anger, so I quickly dragged Katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.

She got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. It was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. By that time, Sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see Fred in tears. She kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. I knew that Katie's presence would ruin things further, and I asked her to get out. She looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.

Fortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. When they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at Katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps I shouldn't have kicked Katie out like this. AITA?

"title: AITA for kicking out friend after only three months over a bird?
content: In February, my husband and I were finally able to purchase our first home, a townhome with a finished basement. Being millennials we invited a friend to live with us and rent the basement. He was in another city and wanted to move to ours for work.

We knew he was eccentric and had many pets. However, it got bad pretty much right away. He was going through a terrible depressive episode and didn't do any cleaning. Things are supposed to be better now but it seems like he doesn't spend much time with his animals, just looks at them while he games. For the most part they are fish and reptiles so they keep quiet.

Except the bird.

Five years ago he purchased a parrot. This parrot species supposedly has the loudest shriek of any parrot. And if they're not socialised during puberty they will hate everyone but their owner. Well, his puberty was during quarantine and I'm not even sure he likes our friend. He cries and our roommate just bangs the cage. It's so uncomfortable to be around.

So, it's been three months and I think it's time to call it. He's on a month to month lease. My husband is reluctant because we've been friends for years, invited him up here, his life has been a wreck, we knew he had a bird before he moved in. But he's making good money now, and I'd like for our first home to be harmonious. I understand we could rent to a stranger that's worse but I wouldn't mind trying for someone with no pets that cleans.

"title: AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago?
content: For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement “Never Have I Ever cheated before” came up.

Now’s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my “boyfriend” of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn’t drink, he went “hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex’s name*). You have to drink to that!”

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn’t haven’t any of it and ended things on the spot. I’m numb. I’m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words. I just can’t look at him right now. He ruined my life.

content: 8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.

When Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.

When I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.

My sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.

She keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.

We had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said ""auntie keeps turning the wifi off"". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.

When we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone ""forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter"" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.

Since leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.

"title: AITA for kicking this girl out of my house after she mistook my UK flag for a confedrate flag? And was planning to get us fired from our jobs?
content: So for a bit of background, we are all in our mid 20s and live in the USA. 

Me and two of my friends rent out a decent size house and we had a get together. My roommate is friends with these two girls call them Kate and Jess, and they invite with them a new friend call her Ashley. Now Ashley when she comes over I see that she is recording us, I thought she was just posting to her Instagram and Snapchat. I don't pay attention to any of it really. 

I notice that she is just video taping a lot, so I am like Kate can you check on your friend like whats going on? Turns out.. she thought that the UK flag we have hanging in our living room was a confederate flag. And she was getting ""Evidence against us."" When she found out that it wasn't everyone just acted like it was a huge joke. 

But I got pissed, like for real? you think we are racist, yet invite you over to our house, where you have our hospitality and our food/alcohol. In the meanwhile you are getting evidence to ruin our livelihoods? I don't want anyone like that in my house AT ALL. So I make a scene and get her to leave. Kate and Jess say it was just a misunderstanding. I was like no there wasn't ts the principle behind it. 

Some of our friends have came to Ashley's side but I don't see how you can support her.",nta
"title: AITA for lashing out at my boyfriend's sister after she kept taking his clothes ?
content: AITA for getting upset at my boyfriend's sister for taking his clothes?

I (20 F) have been with my boyfriend (22 M) for 2 years now and therefore know his family really well. I get along with them and we have formed a close bond together and I really enjoy spending time with them as well as with my family.

Since we are so close, it is quite common for us to share or gift things, and I personally do not have a problem with it. I am glad that they accept me as their family, however, recently I've noticed that my boyfriend's sister (18 F) has been wearing his clothes quite a lot.

Now, one in all this isn't an issue. I think it's normal for siblings to share stuff like clothes. The issue is that all the clothes she takes from him are things that I gifted him. Matching shirts, hoodies or sweatpants - ever since we've been together she keeps taking the things I got for us. 

It's fine if she likes the same things and I wouldn't mind lending things to her if she actually returned them.

I've noticed this when my boyfriend wouldn't wear what I got him anymore. At first I thought it was because he didn't like them a lot or maybe due to sentimental reasons, but he later told me they're constantly in the laundry and then his sister takes them. He tried talking to her about it but she just said that ""it's not a big deal"". 

When I visited them recently, I noticed that she was wearing a pair of cartoon sweatpants that I bought for both me and my boyfriend. When I asked my boyfriend why she has them, he just shrugged and told me that he didn't even know she had them. He did seem genuinely upset about it, but I also know he could never raise his voice at his sister. As I already mentioned before, he already tried to talk to her about it but she keeps shrugging it off.

Now, about a week ago I completely lost it. I was scrolling through my Instagram and came across a post from his sisters account. It was a picture of her and her friend at a party and her friend was wearing MY hoodie that I forgot at my boyfriend's place. If it was her wearing it I might've been fine with it but this was a complete stranger who was wearing my hoodie, which was also very expensive as it was merch from an artist I really like.

A few days ago, I decided to ask his sister if she could give him the hoodie so he can give it to me when he visits and she told me she doesn't have it and neither does her friend. I do admit it might be a little petty but I lashed out at her for being irresponsible with other people's belongings. She did lose some of the clothes I gifted my boyfriend before but this just threw me over the edge.

I know they're just clothes but I paid for them. I spent money that I barely even have to thank my boyfriend for everything he does for me. I know I am not obligated to but giving other people gifts is my love language and I am happy doing it. 

Am I the asshole for lashing out at her and being upset ?

EDIT: Sorry I didn't clarify but she didn't know that the hoodie she lost was mine. She took it thinking it was his.",nta
"title: AITA for lashing out on my Army mom?
content: I (16F) am currently super annoyed with my mom (49F). When I say Army, I don’t mean military, I mean BTS Kpop stan. 

I don’t even know when it started and frankly don’t want to recall. She all of a sudden started liking BTS and was so happy to tell me about it since I used to like BTS (in 4th grade for like 2 months). But things got worse. Like real bad. 

She has an “office” room/bedroom in our house that is maxxed out in BTS merch. She has 22 pillows (yes, I counted) of various Korean boys like the actor Lee Minho and of course her favorite BTS member V. I get if it was just something she was so passionate about, but it’s gotten out of hand and I’ve slowly been getting more and more annoyed about it. Like it’s chipping away at me. Her personality has now been centered around BTS. Blankets, accessories, and various other items are scattered all over our house. She’s always ALWAYS listening to them super loudly and whenever I have a bad day at school and just want her to play the music a little quieter, she makes a HUGE scene. She has gone out of her way to text my friends without my knowledge just because she thought they mentioned they liked BTS to see if she could borrow something BTS from them. 

She guilt tripped my dad into buying her a four-thousand-dollar ticket to their concert and still complained that she didn’t get sound check. 

This also has been going on for almost 3 years now. 3 years and I can’t go like 4 hours without hearing her say something about BTS. She even goes out of her way to send me articles and stuff when she knows how much it infuriates me. Important to note that I haven’t always been this angry about it, but her only talking and caring about BTS for around 3 years now the “oh haha my mom is a kpop stan” has turned into pure annoyance. 

Even in my most critical moments when I asked her to just stop talking about it in front of me she got mad. It’s been really hard recently in my life with school and my parents getting divorced (BTS also played a small factor in that but a factor nonetheless) so I did blow up on her today after I was having an awful day at school and she sent me an article. I also had to put up with her basically forcing my friend to talk about them yesterday in the car. 

AITA? I know we all have something’s to be passionate about and I shouldn’t lash out because she sent me an article, but i’m so tired ;-;

TL;DR my mom is a BTS fanatic and insists on talking to me about it even when i’ve asked her to just keep it down a bit",info
"title: AITA for laughing at my mom after she and my dad insisted i tell my friend’s boyfriend to leave my house?
content: I (F20) moved out on my 18th birthday and never looked back. I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don’t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. 

So you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn’t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren’t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn’t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. 

I didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it’s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i’ll join and say hi. As i’m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend’s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone’s face kinda froze and i didn’t think much of it. 

My mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn’t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again

My mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn’t know what else to do but laugh. I said “are you out of your mind” and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it’s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?

~~~
Edit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! 

For those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it’s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.

I seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I’d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they’ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i’ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i’m sure there’s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I’m not familiar with setting boundaries sorry

I found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i’m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not.",nta
"title: AITA for laughing in my brother and SIL’s faces when they demanded to use my credit card?
content: So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. 

I also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.

The only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. 

Things went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.

When I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument.

"title: AITA for leaving my babies inside by themselves
content: I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~

I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. 

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. 

I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. 

I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",nta

"title: AITA for leaving my prom date behind?
content: This past week my school had its prom. I asked one of my friends if she would be my date and she agreed. It was nothing more than us just going as friends. My mom let me use her car for transportation and told me that I had to be back before 3AM. The dance ended at 11 but some of my friends got a Airbnb so me and my date left early and went to hang there. That's what most people do anyway.

So we're having a good time just chilling and drinking. Nothing crazy is going on, it's not like some huge after party. We had been there for about 3 hours when my mom text me telling me I should be on my way back. It was a bit earlier than she told me but I had to take my date back anyway so I decided I would be fine with leaving.

Well when I tell my date that it's time for us to go, she pushes back against that. She says she wants to say longer, I tell her we can't because I won't be back home in time if we stay since I have to drop her off. She's really drunk at this point and just refuses to go.

That's when I decide that I'm just going to leave by myself. I don't even try to tell her anymore, I just leave and get back home on time.

The next day I wake up to a ton of missed calls and text, most coming from her and a few from other people. She was cussing me out about leaving her and a ton of shit. She was yelling in some voicemails. Acting like we're actually dating and I betrayed her somehow. Other people were asking me why I left and where I went. I just ignored all of it. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for leaving my sisters in a horrible situation?
content:  

I (17F) plan on moving out of my mom's (37F) house in late july, early august. I had originally planned on leaving after I graduate next January. My mom has heavily relied on me to watch my younger sisters (3F and 6F) throughout the day and when she goes to work at night. She is a bartender, so she doesn't get home until near 4 or 5 am. An important thing to know is that my older brothers (20M and 18M) both moved out before 18, as soon as they had the chance. My mom has a pattern of picking fights with one of the kids, typically the oldest in the house. So once the younger brother moved out, I was the target of these arguments. But, I was only 15 at that point, so I couldn't do anything. My mom doesn't like kids, including her own. She loves us, but she doesn't like any of us. Currently, she doesn't pick fights with me, and I believe the reason for that is because she needs me to take care of the girls. I try my best to deal with the girls, as I also don't like children, but they need me so I'm there. Many times, my mom will hide in her room and have me watch the girls as she's overwhelmed after they do one thing to piss her off. But whenever I endure hours of their behavior and try to ask for help, she says she's busy. When it comes to the dishes, we rotate turns. When it's my turn, she constantly nags at me to get them done. When it's her turn, she waits until we run out of clean dishes, and then still a few days, or really whenever she feels like it to clean. She complains to me about many things in a way of telling me to take care of them while she goes out with her friends and leaves me with the girls. Yesterday, I got to my breaking point when I had to clean up 3 very large messes made by the girls throughout the day while she sat in her room. I later brought up the idea of moving out before senior year, telling her it'll be easier on me and my friend I'm moving in with later on anyways. I am also taking my two small dogs, which are 11 and 8 currently. The one that's 11 is getting to be very snappy and short tempered. The girls often like to screw with her and the 8 year old until their breaking point. I am also taking one of the two kittens we have. My mom didn't say much and every time I've brought it up afterwards, she changes the conversation. She is clearly pissed at me. Something me and my grandma are concerned about is what will happen to the girls after I leave. My mom doesn't try to spend any time with them or work on their behavior in a beneficial way. My mom has also been mentally going off the tracks, slowly over the last couple of years. So really, I don't care what my mom thinks about moving out. I'm worried that I'm the AH for leaving my little sisters in that situation, which could become potentially dangerous. AITA?

(If it matters, the girls go to their dad's house half of the week. The younger one's dad cares about her but the older one's dad only takes her so he doesn't have to pay child support.)",nta
"title: AITA for leaving my sisters wedding?
content: For a little backstory, I (24F) and my sister (26F) have never been crazy close, but we get on well. 

I found out I was pregnant with my daughter (unplanned) about a year after she announced she was engaged. At the time the invited were sent out, my daughter wasn’t born, but she would have been at the time of the wedding, so I called my sister and asked what the rules were in regard to children. She said it was child free. 

I made arrangements for someone to have the baby on the day of the wedding, and thought no more of it. 

For some additional context, I was extremely unwell my entire pregnancy, and almost died giving birth. Not once did my sister ask how we were, not even when the baby was born (not even a text to say congratulations). 

She was 4 months old by the time of the wedding and my sister had met her once and that was only because I went down to see her (I live 100 miles away). 

We get to the wedding and turns out it’s not child free. It’s not even baby free. This broke my heart, and I was so angry, so I just left the wedding and went and picked up my child and drove back home. 

2 weeks later my sister calls me and asks why my husband and I left, and when I told her, she kicked off saying it wasn’t personal my daughter wasn’t invited, the other babies were invited as they were her family. I just told her that her niece is also her family and hung up. 

Some of my family think I’m TA and should have just sucked it up for my sisters wedding but my friends are on my side.",nta
"title: AITA for leaving my weed out for my nephew to discover?
content: I smoke weed almost every day. I am married but have no kids of my own yet, so I'm not usually in the frame of mind of having kids in the house. As such, I don't normally feel the need to keep my weed hidden or out of reach. Or any other things that might not be safe for children.

My half sister and my nephew (10 years old) live out of state, but recently came back for a visit due to a death in the family. They haven't met my wife in person or seen my apartment, so they stopped by. When we found out they were coming, we did a sweep of the house to put anything we wouldn't want my nephew being exposed to. 
Except the bedroom, because we didn't expect anyone to go in there. Even then, the only thing out in the open was a weed grinder with some grinded up weed in it. It's designed to look like a dragon ball. It's an orange sphere with the stars on it.

I have a gaming PC that I keep in the bedroom. Somehow the topic got to video games with my nephew and I absent mindedly let him in there to play some games for a bit.

I let him play a game for a bit and we were having a good time. Eventually we traded seats so I could pull up a different game for him, and he started looking around my room, immediately noticing the dragon ball grinder. As soon as he mentioned it, I tried to play it off and tell him it was a collectable so he shouldn't mess with it. It was too late, he was all over it and quickly realized it opened up to reveal my grinded up weed. 

He asked me if it was weed, so I told him it was, and decided he was mature enough to understand. I explained that as an adult, I'm able to partake in stuff like that responsibly and in moderation, but that it's unhealthy for someone his age, etc. I compared it to alcohol. I thought we had a good talk as he understood my point and dropped it. We played more games until they had to go. 

Well, as soon as they left, he told my half sister all about it, who promptly called me and told me how much a piece of shit druggie I was for exposing her child to my filthy habits. I tried to explain my mistake and she just wasn't having it. However, importantly, she was more angry that I ""tried to teach him about drugs"" by not lying about what it was. She then told some of our other family, who were less upset but still took her side in the sense that I should be way more responsible than that, and one person brought up that it wasn't my place to explain weed to him.

I can kinda see their point, but he already knew what it was, and I didn't think lying to him would help my case.
I might be the asshole because I should've thought about my grinder being out before I allowed him into the room, and because she is his parent and it's up to her to tackle these issues with him in her own way.",nta
"title: AITA for leaving the call when my brother announced that his gf is pregnant?
content: My brother and I do not get on.

When we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.

There was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.

You really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.

I have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?

Anyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.

Yesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.

I just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.

I received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just ""been a man"" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to think

EDIT

I just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  

A lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.

The rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.

I think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.

Sorry I can't reply to all your comments but I've been trying to read them all. Thanks again Reddit.",nta

I (f29) have been dating my boyfriend (m35) 'Ricky' for 5 months. He's divorced but hates this word and goes with the word ""divorcee"" instead since the first one makes it sound like he was ""dumped"" when it was him who initiated it.


Anyways, He always go on long rants about his exes and say stuff like ""I hope you don't have this awful habit my ex has"" or ""hope you like XYZ cause my ex didn't"" and the list goes on.


I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.


Last night he invited his family to join us for dinner. We got to the restaurant first. He asked me if I ""brought"" enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said ""I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!"" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said ""well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway"" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.


I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute ""you're making money a priority just like my ex did"" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.

We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",nta
"title: AITA for letting my parents pay for my (23F) hobby when they stopped paying for my sister's hobby when she turned 18?
content: \*All names are fake

My sisters (Freya 25F and Nina 19F) and I (23F) started horse riding when we were kids (I was around 9). We all started the same year, so Nina started younger than us.

I stopped horse riding the year I turned 18, when I finished high school and went to uni. I did not want to get my driving licence yet (car crash a year before, I have severe anxiety issues and panicked at the idea of driving) but it did not feel right to ask my parents to drive me when I was technically old enough to drive myself. Freya stopped the same year too, Nina is the only one still doing it.

Nina turned 18 last year, and from then on my parents told her that 1) they would not pay for horse riding anymore because they have to pay for all of our studies and flats in the city we study in (I and Nina share a flat), and 2) they would not drive her there anymore as she’s old enough to get her licence (she did not want to yet). It was the exact same deal they presented me with the year I turned 18, which I turned down for the reasons mentioned above. Nina took it, paid for it with the money earned while working in the summer, and shared a ride with a lady from our town or used mom’s bike.

Now, my main hobbies are playing games (free games or puzzle games I buy myself), writing, and baking/cooking. We both come home every weekend and I spend an average of 10 hours over two days baking/cooking (sometimes a little less if I’m lazy, or more if I make complex things). I’m definitely not a pro, but a) I’ve been baking for years, b) I study baking in my spare time with professional books and videos, and c) I went to a few workshops in professional bakeries.

I adore baking and cooking, but I tend to overwork myself a bit on weekends to the point I’m not really rested at the end of it. I will usually make at least 1 actual dessert and 1 snack (biscuits, meringues, whatever else) per weekend, sometimes more, plus 1 or 2 meals (which are often longer meals to prep, like lasagna or sushi) so mom does not have to cook too much on her weekends.

Now, onto the issue: my parents pay for my hobby. They pay for ingredients (I only pay for professional-grade ingredients like vanilla beans), and for any baking supplies I need like baking tins or piping tips. Ingredients cost them around €12/weekend, and baking supplies cost them less than €5/month since I have a good amount already, and sometimes buy myself a specific thing I’m missing. I of course do not make them pay any of the labour cost (that would go up to around €80/weekend, depending on how many things I make).

According to Nina, I am the asshole for having my hobby paid for almost entirely by our parents, when hers is not (horse riding costs her \~€100/month). I might be the asshole for letting them finance MY hobby since I could pay for everything myself. I bake to make them happy, but it's also to have fun myself.

So, AITA for letting my parents pay for my hobby when they don’t pay for hers anymore?",info
"title: AITA for letting my sister walk me down the aisle despite my fiance and his family's objections?
content: I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.

A few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.

My future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.

I told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.

I definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?

**EDIT**    
I did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  
**Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  
Yes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted. 

**Does your fiance have sisters?**  
No; he has two younger brothers.

**Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  
He did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. ""Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet"".  It was very sweet and cute. 

**What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  
Because of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life. 

**Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  
That was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest. 

**Your sister is amazing!**  
She is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime. 

**Please update us**  
I absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. ",nta

"title: AITA for losing it and telling in-laws to stop calling me “mama” and trying to erase my identity?
content: I have 2 kids, 2f, 4f. I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don’t get to be my own person. I’m just mommy.

Husband doesn’t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! 

And like matching outfits. I don’t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I’m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they’re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?

From the time we got to the in-laws, it was “mama” this and “mama” that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said “You know my name is (Carmen), right?” she just looked at me funny and said “Of course, silly?” I said “So why do you keep calling me “mama”? You aren’t going around calling (husband) papa?” SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “Um, okay.” 

This went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? 

At that point I was just like “Do you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?”

The same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said “But you’re such a good mama!”

I said that I’m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said “Why didn’t you guys get him anything that says  “papa”? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?”

MIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just “so excited” about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.

I was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole “Are you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn’t healthy” faux concern thing that’s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.

The other one was angry and saying that “is being a mom somehow beneath you” and “do you think you’re better than the rest of us?” and all that.

When we finally left, he asked me why I’d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven’t. No one listened to me before. I’ve said these things plenty of times. I’ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I’d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.

I said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. 

We’re at a stalemate. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for lying to my friend and kicking her out?
content: I (20F) moved halfway across the US for school about a year ago. My friend Mary (18F) told me she was coming down for my spring break. I was excited because it had been a while since I'd seen Mary. 

She would’ve only been here Tues-Fri, and that was perfect, but two weeks before she came down she told me that tickets were cheaper if she did Tues-Thurs. I thought she was cutting a day. She meant over a week long. We've discussed before how we just aren’t the type of people who can spend over 72hrs with someone, so I already knew this was bad. I expressed that to her but she didn't care.

On the first day, we didn't talk until dinner. After dinner, she wanted to drink at my apartment. Mary is known to exaggerate or fake being intoxicated and unsurprisingly, she did just that. I decided to call it a night and after maybe 30mins she came in and said “You're no fun, it’s kinda pathetic”.

The next day she wanted to go swimming, so we did. My apartment is on a lake so she wanted to take pictures there to make it look like she went to the beach. After pictures, I looked at them and expressed how I didn't like them and she came back with “Well it’s not my fault you’re just an ugly unphotogenic cow”. That broke me. I had no words but luckily my mom called me not even 10 seconds after. I told my mom everything that happened and she told me to kick her out and to say my mom found out about the drinking and will call the cops if she didn't leave. I thought it would keep our friendship intact because it wasn’t something I had made her leave for. Mary had to call her dad because she didn’t have the money for a hotel or plane tickets. Which came to be a lie.

Mary didn't contact me until the next morning, and all she said was “I need to be at the airport by 11”. I took her and she just kept talking about how my mom was insane. 

I thought things would be fine after, but she didn’t say a word to me for weeks. Anne, a mutual friend, was asking me what happened. I didn’t tell her much until I heard that Mary had been misconstruing everything.. Anne was appalled and got our other friend Tessa on the call. Tessa mentioned that I owed Mary $40 from the trip since she paid for our dinner, but Mary had told me she was covering it since I was paying for everything else. Mary owed Tessa close to $1000 for watching her puppy but never paid her, so Anne sent a cash app request. 

Maybe 2 minutes later my phone starts blowing up with calls and texts from Mary, but I didn’t answer. We had a long “fight” over text where she called me hostile, childish, and insane. Mary’s friend told Anne that she was going to kill her the next time she saw her, so I told Mary that if she wants to bring people into this then I have no problem calling her family and the cops. They went silent after that and I haven't heard anything since.

I’m rethinking everything. I feel like I'm the AH for making an extreme lie instead of just talking and causing issues for my other friends.",yta

"title: AITA for lying to my parents?
content: This weekend, my parents and my sister were going out of state but I wanted to stay home so I could study for AP exams. My parents were fine with that but they didn't want me to spend the night alone so they arranged for me to spend the night at my friend's house (we'll call her Ava) in another town. They told me that her dad would pick me up at 8 and that I should give them this king-sized chocolate bar as a thank you.

Well, her dad showed up before 8 so I was packing in a rush and forgot the bar, even though my parents reminded me 3 times. I didn't realize it until it was time to go to bed, and I told Ava that I forgot to give her family this chocolate bar, and that I would give it to her the next time I saw her. I also told her that if my parents ask if I gave her family the bar, I'm going to say that I gave it to Ava and she ate it, and she agreed.

My mom called me the next morning and asked if I gave her family the bar, so I lied that I gave it to Ava and she ate it, figuring that if I hid the bar when I got home and gave it to her the next time I saw her, I could get away with it and Ava got what she wanted, her king-sized chocolate bar.

When my family showed up later to pick me up, Ava told my sister that she had to tell her something. I knew what she was going to say so I told her not to tell my sister but she did anyways. My sister then told my dad who told my mom that I forgot the chocolate bar at home.

It felt like a long car ride home. My mom was mad at me for lying because it wasn't that big of a deal if I'd forgotten it and she could have stopped by Meijer to get something because it was nice of Ava's family to let me spend the night at their house for free and by not giving them something as a thank you, I'm sort of scamming them. She also said that if I told her the truth, I would have only gotten in trouble for forgetting, but since I lied, I'm in trouble for forgetting and lying about it. She said that she can't trust me now because I told her earlier that I studied at Ava's house, I could have been watching kdramas for all she knows, even though I did actually study at their house. My dad chimed in and said that because he told my sister to take my Converse without my permission, he was going to pay me $5 as comp, but since I lied, I don't get $5 anymore. But I wasn't listening all that closely because I was mostly pissed at Ava because she was getting her candy anyways (although later) so she really had no reason to open her mouth. I thought, I gave her my notes, username, and password for this really expensive SAT prep course, and she backstabbed me for no reason? I thought to myself, damn, I really would have gotten away with this if Ava didn't open her mouth.

But am I the asshole for lying? Is this my karma for lying? Should I have told Ava not to tell my whole family instead of just telling her not to tell my parents? Is she not exactly in the wrong for only directly telling my sister who told everyone else?",yta
"title: AITA for lying to my uncle and his family?
content: Using fake names here for privacy. 
My (18F) uncle ""Jim"" married ""Stella"". They have a daughter ""Beverly"". Now Stella has a sister ""Sofia"" and she has a daughter ""Janice"". 

Janice, though not related to me; is a close friend of mine as we live in neighboring towns. Beverly is our common cousin. Janice and Beverly are both 8 years older than me and grew up together closer than sisters. But recently there has been a tiff between Stella and Sofia, their moms. I may be wrong but I feel it *might* be about Janice's sexuality. She recently came out as lesbian and has a gf. She told me this herself in person and seperately told Beverly too. I have no objections to this so my friendship with Janice isn't affected. But Beverly who is MY OWN cousin stopped being in touch with ME cause she got to know Janice and her mum spend holidays with us, such as Christmas/New year etc. Beverly and me were always cool so it was surprising to me that she just went NC one day. We are on each other's insta but that's about it.

Janice and her mom told my family one day to stop telling my uncle Jim and his family whenever they spend time at our place. They never told us why but we just all kinda agreed. I feel like my uncle suspected they were hanging out with us though and asked my dad one day. He said no they are not here. Beverly too asked me seperately and I said no, I haven't heard from them in a while. It's their family and their politics so I don't know why any of this is happening but my family is stuck in the middle with no explanation so I wanna know if I'm wrong for encouraging this. _AITA for lying to someone who is actually my family for someone who is a friend (even though a close one)?_ I feel like my uncle and his daughter should mind their own business though.",nta
"title: AITA for making a big deal about 1 extra credit point on my child's test?
content: My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was ""Chanukah"". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to ""Hanukkah"". She said to my daughter ""you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?"" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.

I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.

The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.

My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.",nta
"title: AITA for making a rude comment to my dad’s neighbor and potentially ruining their relationship?
content: I (and my dog) recently moved into my dad’s house. We’ve been here for about a week, and so far everything has been really nice. He lives in a large neighborhood with many families, children, and tons of other dogs.

This morning, I was letting my dog out to go potty (it was raining for the first time since I got here) in our front yard. It’s important to note that she did poop in the grass, but it was pretty much right in front of our front door, and at least 10 feet away from the sidewalk. I didn’t bring a poop bag out with me because I was holding her leash and an umbrella, and I also didn’t want her to be outside getting drenched in the rain any longer than necessary. My intention was to let my dog back into the house, dry her off, then come right back out to pick up the poop. With 100% honesty, I can genuinely say that I have NEVER just left her poop in the yard and not picked it up. I always pick it up instantly or come right back out with a bag once I let her back inside. If it’s your backyard, or if your front yard is secluded away so that children or other animals can’t get to the poop, it’s really not a big deal to me if you don’t pick it up right away, because that’s your own personal property. But when it comes to shared spaces, I absolutely despise people that just leave their dog’s poop in public spaces/other people’s yards and really think that they should not be pet owners. 

Anyhow, the very second that my dog finished pooping, my dad’s neighbor across the street opens her front door and starts yelling at me about how I needed to pick up the poop. She accused me of being lazy and not taking care of the neighborhood. This caught me completely off guard and I was just so appalled and taken aback that this woman (whom I have never met before) would say something so accusatory and rude, that I admittedly got a bit snarky back at her. I said, “Excuse me ma’am, mind your own business. This is my home, and I will pick up my dog’s poop when it is time for me to pick up my dog’s poop. Go back to bed.” (Because the woman literally came out in the rain in her nightgown and bonnet just to yell at me). 

I told my dad what happened and he sounded shocked. He said that this woman has baked him treats and cooked for him before, and that she was really nice. He was disappointed that I said something rude back to her because he was worried that she would stop feeding him. 

I know I shouldn’t have said anything to her. I’m normally the type to just kill people with kindness, but I think I was just so flustered and shocked that I impulsively said the first thing that came to mind. 

I’m still annoyed that she would accuse me of not taking care of my dog’s poop, but I do feel bad that I stooped to her level, and I might have ruined my dad’s relationship with his neighbor. But WIBTA for the way I responded to her, is she at fault for accusing me the way she did, or are we just both in the wrong in this situation?",info

"title: AITA for making homemade food for everyone except my brother's stepdaughter?
content: I (27F) am not a professional chef, but I have taken a bunch of cooking classes and love making elaborate meals for friends and family. About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. 

Last weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. 

I thought the ""take out"" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was ""unbelievable"" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. 

I felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?",nta

They are already making it out like I don’t exist but when they see me they make sly comments to everybody even when I’m in ear shot. He does nothing about this and just lets it slide. I don’t want anything to do with them but he insists he’s not changing or choosing his girlfriend over his best friend.

"title: AITA for making my cousin cry?
content: I (16 F) are close friends with my cousin (16F) but she can really annoy. 
My cousin is gorgeous but her personality over the last few years has changed. She has become a jealous person who always has to one up you. 

I win an award; she has to win two more the next year. I want a scholarship for a college; suddenly she wants a scholarship for the same college. 
Recently I have began to like a close friend of my cousin & I. Thinking what could the harm be I consulted her about my feelings. I have also never been in a relationship but my cousin has been in plenty so thought I could seek advice from her. However, my Cousin tell me that she feels the same way about this boy without ever expressing interest previously, suddenly she is all over him.
She went from never messaging him to always messaging him, hanging out with him & “being madly in love”. 

Last night my cousin rang me deciding to “give me a friendly heads up” that I will never have a chance with this boy because he is to infatuated with her.(she has rejected this boy before and broke his heart.I also offered to back off when she admitted her feelings but she didnt do the same for me) 
I had pulled the boy aside the same day & talked to him about my feelings and my cousins. he told me that he would like a possible relationship with me when things with cousin die down in hopes to not ruin my relationship with her (which I found sweet). 
I was happy to let her go on thinking she could have it her way until she began to degrade our friend calling him to ugly for her, dumb & the r slur (he has disabilities which he’s sensitive about) for thinking she would get with him.  

This is where I snapped & laid it into her. I told her she was a spoilt,jealous brat that doesn’t know the difference between right & wrong. I said how she uses her dad cheating as an excuse but she has turned into a copy of him & she will head down the same path of a 30 year old drug addict scumbag like him if she doesn’t change. The conversation ended with her crying & me continuing to rip into her for a few minutes before hanging up & calling our friend to tell him what was said before a story can get told.  

When I arrived at school the next morning (today) I was pulled into the office to find my aunt, uncle, cousin & crush sitting inside. Friend looked uncomfortable, aunt looked angry & my cousin was balling her eyes out clearly displaying fresh ‘scratches’ on her.
My family thinks I was too harsh on her yet my crush understands why I did it. I think she needed to hear it since she’s never been told no. I’m suspended from school until I agree to apologise to her which I refuse to do until she apologises. I’ve been told I’ll be moving classes & to stay away from our friend because ‘he is causing to much drama’ my family+school believe I should let my cousin have him

AITA in this situation? Did I take it to far?  Should I back off & let her have our friend?",info
"title: AITA for making my ex-MIL homeless?
content: I (26M) have been helping my ex-MIL (47F) with rent for months now. This started back before me and my ex’s relationship ended, but continued afterwards due to ex-MIL having no income and high rent. 

Ex-MIL has had no job for 1.5 years, although she is very much capable. She was a high school teacher and has a master’s degree in business. She is too entitled for her own good and I’ve had it. She also has to support her son (22M) who has a part-time job and goes to school. 

Recently, my ex (27F) has moved away with her new partner and left without helping her family, which I very much understand, but ex-MIL now feels entitled for me to continue helping her as if nothing has changed. I’ve had a serious conversation with her letting her know all income from me will stop, and she is trying to guilt trip me into helping her. She has also tried to make up false accusations about various things to pretend she has dirt on me in order for me to help her. 

I was more than kind enough to give her a few hundred dollars in order to find a new living arrangement, but her, her son and her dog will now have to live in extended stay hotels until she gets a job, or her son saves up enough with the income he gets, which isn’t a lot. She also is NC with her family as she’s the “black sheep” of her family (not surprising).

"title: AITA for making my fiancé watch twilight
content: My fiancé (37M) and I (26F) have been together for over 6 years and engaged for 3 of those years. We are both neurodivergent so some of the things we do seem weird to others but seem to be typical for neurodivergent couples. 

We enjoy parallel play where we are in the same room but doing our own thing. And some times we get together and share activities together, usually one the couch watching something together. My fiancé almost all ways picks what we watch. Most of the time I don’t mind because we have a lot of the same interests like Star Wars, let’s plays, and anime. 

He gets super excited and starts over explaining everything like lore or facts about how the content was made and things like that. And I love that. I love seeing him excited and happy even if it’s something he’s already told me 1,000 times or something I already know.. and sometimes it’s things I’ve told him about 😂. 

The problem is when I pick something… most of the time he will leave the couch and go back to his computer and we go back to being parallel. 

Last year I begged him to watch the twilight sage with me because I haven’t seen them since I was in middle school and I remember being obsessed with them and I knew they were going to be bad [I mean it is twilight] but it was something I thought would be fun and I wanted to do it with him… he refused and it caused an argument. He said I shouldn’t force him to watch something he has no interest in seeing and I told him that I sit through a lot of content that I’m not a fan of but I enjoy it cause he enjoys it. He says that’s my choice and I don’t have to do that… he’s right but it hurts that he doesn’t want to share the things that are important to me. 

Eventually he watched 3 1/2 of the twilight saga with me and I thought we had fun. We were making fun of the silliness and the acting together and we even played a drink game while we watch. 

Fast forward to today and I remembered a old cheesy childhood movie I use to watch all the time[one of the “Three Ninjas” movies] and I asked him if we could watch it together and he refused and said the same thing as before. He even brought up how I “forced” him to watch twilight. This time I just dropped it cause I didn’t want to repeat the same argument. 

Am I the asshole for wanting him to watch stupid cheesy things that I find interesting the same way I do for him?

EDIT: a lot of you guys think I tied him down and genuinely forced him to watch all of sage. He reluctantly sat down for the first one. He started to enjoy the bad silliness with me and HE suggested we watch the other parts. I was thankful after the first one and was ok with watching the rest on my own another time. He was the one who encouraged we watch the rest together and then we couldn’t make it past breaking dawn part 1.

I don’t want to force him to watch everything I watch. I want to be able to share special interests with him without him dismissing it entirely. 

Also if I hated star wars with out seeing anything about it (movie,shows,etc) how many of u would say I should give it a chance and watch one thing before completely dismissing it???",yta
"title: AITA for making my parents choose between my sister going to jail or replacing my car with their vacation money.
content: I (f17) live with my parents. I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. 

They did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  

She has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  

My parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  

Well my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. 

I have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  

My sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. 

When I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  

After talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. 

So rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  

I just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  

AITA?

Hey. I just got home from school.  There is a deadbolt on my bedroom door.  And my mom gave me a key.  She says that she is keeping the other one for emergency.  I agreed as long as it was only for emergencies.",nta
"title: AITA for making my son ask permission to use my computer?
content: I know this might seem petty but I really want to know if I'm being the asshole here.

I (m40s) am a single dad and live with my two kids.

We aren't broke but we don't have money to splurge on the latest phones or computers.

My kids both have phones and they share a PlayStation that sits in the living room. They get alternating nights on the PlayStation to make it fair.

I have a computer in my bedroom that I use for work (I sometimes work from home) but the kids sometimes use it for homework assignments such as making presentations.

My youngest, Josh (m14) has started going into my bedroom and downloading games onto my computer without my knowledge until recently. So after that I put a password on my computer.

I talked to him about it and explained that I don't randomly go onto his phone and download things, so he shouldn't be doing it to my computer.

I told him I'm happy for him to play games on the computer when I'm not using it for work but he needs to ask for my permission first.

Josh seemed to understand at first but he's been really pushing the boundary lately. He gets angry and says that it's not fair he has to ask to use the computer, since he has to share the PlayStation with his sister.

Recently, Josh complained to my parents about it and now they are mad at me and planning on buying him a gaming laptop.

I spoke to them and explained that I'm trying to teach him to respect other people's things, he can't just go and use people's stuff as he pleases.

I'm frustrated and I think they are completely undermining me. I love my kids and I don't want them to become entitled adults.

Their response was incredibly patronising and they said that he's just being a typical modern teenage boy and that there's no need for me to get ""so square"" about everything, and said I'm a jerk for making my own son ask permission to use my computer.

"title: AITA for making up with a friend who did something to my sister?
content: I, 17(f), have a 13(f) sister Nat

Natalie has been collecting plants for a really long time. She has rare ones that she's proud of, and they're really pretty.

I have this one friend named Alex 18(f), who also is into plants but doesn't have much of a collection.\\

Three months ago, she got a plant called a ""Pink Princess."" If anyone doesn't know what that is, it's a green-leaved plant with a few light pink leaves. She liked it and treated it like a baby, lol.

Alex freaked when she first saw it; she said that was her dream plant. She'd ask Nat about it and take pictures to send to her mom. She asked if she could have some cuttings to propagate, but Nat said no.

She kept begging, and my sister got mad at her. She stopped letting Alex take pictures, and Alex stopped talking to her.

One day, I had Alex over, and I was taking a nap while Nat was at GetAir with her bf.

Alex woke me up at some point and said her mom was here to pick her up,  I said okay, and she left.

I went back to sleep and got woken up again by Nat screaming and crying in my face. She asked if I stole any of her leaves to give to Alex, and I told her no. She showed me her plant, and it did look like a few leaves were missing, but it wasn't too noticeable. I did call Alex about it, though, and she admitted it on the phone. She said she mainly only stole 'baby leaves' and would repay my sister for the amount she took.

I hung up and was angry that Alex snuck behind my back to do that, and my mom came home, and my mom banned Alexis from ever coming back to my house. I blocked her, too, when she tried to Apple pay me.

It was silent for months before yesterday in Econ class; she came up to me crying and basically just saying how sorry she was and how she's been trying to apologize but couldn't because I blocked her. She told me how hard things were at home and how much she needed me.

I could tell she was actually sorry, so I hugged her and said I'd give her another chance if she promised to not do that again. She agreed.

I texted Nat that Alex and I made up, and Nat left me on read. I came home, and my mom and Nat were on the couch. I brought up the Alex thing to my mom and asked my mom if Alex would ever be able to come over this weekend if she apologized to Natalie and Nat burst into tears and said she hated me.

I explained to Nat I understood why she's pissed but that Alex doesn't have the best situation, and it really would help for her to be out of the house, and Nat begged my mom to never let her in our house again.

My mom was mad I would even ask her, and she said it was awful I was friends with a ""dirty thief."" I argued it was only friends with her after she apologized, but my mom said I was being a bad sister by forgiving her.

I can only hang out with Alex when I'm at our dad's house now because Nat refuses to go over there.

I still understand why they're mad, but I feel like they don't get that Alex has reasons for why she is the way she is and that she's sorry.

"title: AITA for meeting family?
content: Im going to try and make this a short question.

I have struggled with substance issues pver the years. Mostly smoking and drinking (nothing hardcore link heroin etc). Struggled really bad with depression and the like for at least the past 5+years.
I met my current partner over 2 years ago, and since then I have stopped doing anything, apart from the odd drink at the weekend after a week of work.

I haven't spoken to my 2 sisters in well over a year as both their partners smoke and stuff. This was where I'd go most nights and we would be just chatting, drinking and all that. I'd then go home and do the same.
Pretty s*** time of it really.

So anyway, I cut all that out my life to avoid the temptation. I'm now not doing any of that and have a better life for it. New job, have a better home, better job etc etc 

Now, I have after all this agreed to go for a meal with one of my sisters and father and explain why I've gone this route and how it has helped me. I just want to clear the air so to speak.

My partners reaction to me agreeing to this meal is that she is leaving - doesn't want any of that in her life and is looking at places to move to. Ignoring me and saying that we have nothing to talk about. She says she doesn't trust me to not ""do it"".

"title: AITA for mentally checking out of a conversation with my mother
content: I'm a 32 male that lives with his mother. I have my own job, help out with bills, and provide for myself. The issue I am having is I just mentally check out whenever I feel that my point isn't getting across or that I hear something I don't like. Please read fully before judging. There was an issue with a bill that my mother pays. Services were about to be shut off. Well Monday she informed me through text. I offered to use my card and no response.  When I got home she started explaining what was going on. Last month it was shut off because she didn't receive any bill or calls that it was about to be turned off. She paid to get it turned on the next day since it would have been $150 extra for same day.  From what i know the bill is due on the 22nd. Friday she was informed it would be turned off again if $90 isn't paid by Monday.  She had called Friday and was told nothing could be done right now but call Monday.  That day comes and she is on the phone for 2 hours. Now here comes the part where I don't know if I'm wrong or not. While explaining the calls, she states to the company she was thinking about offing herself if it was turned odd because of the troubles she is going through. Once I heard that I just mentally checked out and left.  She gets upset because I wouldn't let her tell the story.  I'm pissed she just casually throws that out there.  Not to mention she has pulled similar stunts with me and my siblings before.  I go back and explain why I don't like it.  Her main comment was she would never do that. She just wanted to try and keep the services on till Friday when she got paid. After talking I find out the bill is $205.  Tried stating I would pay but that's not what she wanted. She claims i am the only one besides her friend that she can just talk to and vent.  When talking to me, she states she has to watch what she says because I'll just walk away.

"title: AITA for missing my nieces dance recital?
content:  Let me begin my first saying I (33f) cause a lot of issues with my sister (35f) because I am a terrible communicator. I am awful at saying no and setting boundaries so my sister is used to telling me what to do and I do it as to avoid any issues. I now have a 3 year old son. I work 60 hour weeks as a CPA so I only see my child 2 hours a day on weekdays and then on weekends. I feel really bad for him because both my mom and my MIL were SAHMs. When my sister had her first child she was a SAHM, but now she works part time. Also to set the stage, I have babysat her 2 children about 4 times a year for the last 7 years including multiple overnights, but she has watch my child one time for 2 hours. When I do an overnight cousin spend the night I buy them dinner, plan an activity, take them to the park, and get them matching pajamas, have pancakes for breakfast. Also when my sister couldn't go on spring break with her kids this year because it was her 10-year wedding anniversary so she sent her kids and a nanny to join us on our vacation, which was fun, but because the nanny only worked certain hours, I had to watch all 3 kids until my sister and BIL joined us. Also I have gone to my niece and nephew's class Easter parties and other school events. My sister has said my child is too wild and whiny for her to babysit and has never really tried to have a relationship with him. She tells him that he must hate her because he won't kiss or hug her, but really he is just uncomfortable around her because she has never been kind or loving to him. She has told him that he is whinny and manipulative. Last year my sister asked us to attend her daughter (4f) dance recital. We drove 1 hour round trip to sit in the hot sun in Texas summer. We were not told it was outside so my 2 year old (age at the time) had to sit outside for an hour without sunscreen. No one said thankyou for coming, so I decided it was not that important that we came. This year we got invited through a group text and  my son already had a playdate scheduled at that time so I did not reschedule since it was not a big deal that we came last year. My sister called me and yelled at me that I am a terrible aunt that what I did was wrong. When I told her I thought my toddler son would have a temper tantrum and be whinny which she hates during the dance, she told me to leave him at home with his Dad. Again I barely see my son and husband already and I did not want to leave them. She said I could have left him for a couple hours to see my niece, but she has never tried to have a relationship with my son so I don't know why I would sacrifice my precious time with my son when my son will never get the same in the relationship with his aunt in the future. The issue above is small, but there have been a million of these situations and I am tired of my son's time being sacrificed with nothing from his aunt in return. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for moving my ex gf’s belongings into the spare room of our shared flat?
content: A bit of background first, my now ex girlfriend (21) and I (23) have lived together since Dec 22. Our current tenancy lasts until Dec 2023.  

In the last month we have been consistently arguing with one another about what feels like every little thing. She has told me I am not good enough for her and that we are not each others people.  

A couple of examples of this are;  

- She apparently is not a person who finds sexual intimacy an important part of the relationship. In her words, “we had sex at the start of our relationship because it was fun and new”. It has currently been three months since we last had any form of sexual activity with one another. I have asked her multiple times if she still finds me attractive, stopped trying to initiate sex and wait for her to be ready etc.  

- I am a self confessed neat freak and if there is lots of mess I get really stressed out. So I used to ask her if she would help me out like pick up dirty washing, wash up her plates etc. She said i asked too much and to write it down on our whiteboard so she could see what I would like her to do. I started doing this and then that was too much.   

There are others I have omitted due to character count.   

I am very much aware I am not perfect and that sometimes I do slip up and I have hurt her feelings in the past.   

She decided two months ago she wanted to go travelling around Asia for two months this summer. Due to our flat, having two cats and a full time job and not being able to afford it, I couldn’t join her in these plans but fully support her to do this.   

The last two weeks she has had spoke about moving out when she returns from travelling, that she would know where her head is She has called me nasty for doing this and started crying saying I was a horrible person and has now walked out. I don’t want to hurt her but I have been trying to work to show her I want to be with her. If she doesn’t want to be with me, I don’t want to have to leave the room so she can come in and get changed because all her clothes are in ‘my room’.

"title: AITA for moving to a hotel because my wife's family insisted I sleep on the couch?
content: My wife and I got married last summer. Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.

They invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.

I honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).

After arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.

This morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.

About 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.

My wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.

AITA?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Wow, I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the responses and awards! I took the advice of one of the posters here to ask my wife and her sisters to meet me for dinner apart from their parents. It was interesting to say the least.

After we sat down, I leaned into them a bit about what had happened. I asked my wife if she knew her dad was going to demand we sleep separately, and she said she was surprised by it as well - she'd expect that if I were still just her boyfriend, but we're married now. I then asked them all if they thought it was OK for their parents to act the way they did. They said it wasn't, but they know their father and it's best to just let things like this go.

This led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me ""disrespecting him"" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.

I then asked if they thought this was even about house rules, because it seemed more like their dad was just trying to show me who was in charge. They agreed.

Up to this point I had really done everything I could to not escalate this situation, but I started to get really mad that they were all so afraid of how their dad would react. I decided I needed to push back a bit.

I know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents. They know that their dad is probably going to freak out when they leave, but I think they realized this situation had gone too far so they decided they would come and deal with the fallout afterwards.

So that's where this all stands for now. I'm about to check out of my hotel and hit the road for San Diego. My wife and her sisters are coming down in a separate car after their parents leave for work. I fully expect their dad to throw a conniption fit when he finds out they left without telling him, but I really don't care at this point.

"title: AITA for my parent's marriage?
content: I'm 17, turning 18 in less than a month. I am anxious and confused about the situation going on in my family and I'll try to explain it as well as I can.

When I was 12, my brother was born. During this period I pretty much started babysitting him, coming home from school at around 2PM and staying with him so that my mom could do whatever work she had to do/go shopping for groceries. Not only that, but I also babysat him whenever I was on holiday break, including all summer vacations. I ended up staying with him for well over 8 hours daily sometimes, more than my parents.

Now, my brother is turning 6 and doesn't speak properly. He's doing speech therapy and has been getting better. He acted up once at kindergarten which made my mom blame my dad and he got angry, not coming home that day and my mom let my brother cry about it and told him it's his fault as to why he's not home. My mom doesn't do much around the house as she sleeps most afternoons, but she said I also make messes so my dad told me to clean up after myself, so I did.

I came from school once and ate, washing my dishes after out of habit. She then came into my room, asking me if my dad taught me to only wash my own things and started crying. She went on the phone with her friend and after calming down came into my room again to tell me that I'm disrespectful towards her and just like my father. I told her that the whole situation is making me tense and she was condescending about it. I didn't mean to exclude her dishes or anything, but she also said she deliberately left them there to see what I'd do.

Today (and why I decided to make this post) they fought again, and my mom brought me into it. I have vocational work at school and need to pass it, and decided to go to my dad's workplace instead since the teacher agreed and I'd actually do something. My mom found out today and freaked out, telling me I should let her know when I make decisions like these (even though I'm nearly 18) and said that she raised a snake.

I know I could have raised my brother better even if it wasn't my obligation, but I spent my entire adolescence with him and I wasn't patient enough. My mom said she wants a divorce and 5000 euros, and told my dad to sell the house if he doesn't have the money (I don't know where I would live, not that he's gonna sell it.)

My dad has also talked about her when it's only me home, but not to this extent and mostly saying that he doesn't know what to do next. He did say the reason my brother's not talking properly is because she never spends time with him and never plays with him which I have thought about as well before. He tries to spend time with him but is busy.

I honestly don't know what to make of all this anymore, is there a side to my mother's arguments that I'm not seeing? Does she just come tired from work and I should have helped her more, or is my dad also in the wrong here? AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for my reaction when I learned that my fiance returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom picked for me?
content: My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.


Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

ETD Q & As

I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get.

A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type.

B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this ""vision"" has been there for...quite a while.

C. I AM paying for the dress obviously.

D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son.

E. He's still presisting...",nta
"title: AITA for my response to my brother in law's comment about my leg hair?
content: 

So, my f19, sister, f28 and brother in law came over with the kids for dinner at my parents house. 

I was watching my nieces while dinner was getting ready, we sat down and I happened to sit next to brother in law. I was wearing a skirt and it was accidentally lifted above my knee, my brother in law looked down at my leg and made face then loudly said ""Oh shooo, Op! This is gross, you should've shaved, that hair isn't supposed to be there"". Everyone stared, I told him ""if it's not supposed to be there then why does it grow there, can you explain?"" He was like ""it's just not supposed to be there"", I point at his mustache and say ""well, guess the same thing can be said about your little mustache then, huh?"". He looks at meeyes wide open, and awkward silence takes over though some laughed. My sister told me to knock it off as my brother in law got up from his chair and went inside the bathroom. My sister followed and I could hear him having a breakdown asking her if there was something wrong with his mustache, my brother and I kept giggling but dinner got cut short cause my brother in law wanted to leave. 

I later got scolded by my sister saying I stepped over the line and disrespected someone who's older than me, who's herhusband and demanded I apologize to him for insulting him and ruining dinner.


AITA?

Edit - Guys! My sister said the reason my brother in law got so offended was because he considers his mustache as a symbol of his ""manhood"" and so I insulted his ""manhood"" not just made a ""backhanded comment"". She said I psychologically harmed him and should apologize for it but I'm not sure if this fixes anything except how he feels about his mustachy mustache.lol.",nta
"title: AITA for my response to my sister's boyfriend's ""brutal honesty""?
content: 


My F35 sister F27 started dating one of those ""brutally honest"" guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.


I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might ""produce"" defective babies due to age.


I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his ""honest opinion"" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: ""trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!"". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.

I think AITA but I'm not sure.",nta
"title: AITA for my sister ending her pregnancy and possibly her marriage?
content: I (m32) have two older brothers (m38 and m40) and a sister (f34). Note the age differences. Our dad passed away 5 years ago in our hometown (a more suburban town in Wisconsin).

Our family was relatively modest when my brothers grew up, so they were cared for a lot by my parent’s families who are very conservative. My dad personally, was not. By the time me and my sister were born, our dad’s career was doing great and we were well off. Me and my sister have Master’s while our brothers didn’t go to college despite the funds and chances.

My mom had been trying to set my sister up with a churchgoer’s kid. This didn’t progress until around the time my dad died and my sister came back and helped with the funeral. My brother’s families are both in town as well. I worked in tech in China then and live in SF now and since the funeral have been mostly LC with everyone except my sister. Honestly, I was very close with my dad and there was obvious favoritism towards me which the others didn’t like. So, my mom and oldest brother now technically live in my house.

My sister somehow ended up leaving her career and moving back. She married the man my mom set her up with in 2019. I honestly was in shock at the wedding. I really didn’t ever see my sister living on a farm and becoming a stay at home mom. I knew for a fact my mom and brothers had a huge part in this, because there were a lot of “she’s back home” posts. Later I found out that she had pretty much given all her savings to her husband.

Late 2020, my sister, straight out of the blue started calling me and just “chatting” about things. I of course, love this. Early in 2021, my mom told me she was pregnant. I immediately asked my sister about this and she kinda broke down. In short, the husband has been abusive, she’s broke and my family and her in laws haven’t helped. My oldest brother wailed at her about how his wife went through the same thing and my sister should stop thinking she’s special. The first time she called me, he had kicked her out of their home for complaining about their finances. This was fairly common.

This is where IATA: I basically yelled at her too. I told her that she had a career which she can still go back to and I can help her move back to NYC (where she worked / studied before). And that the pregnancy wasn’t the end of it and there were other options.

The next day she asked me for 5k which I sent to her without asking. I didn’t hear much after and didn’t intrude coz it was a total mindfuck. A month later my sister told me she had gotten a new job in NYC and filed for divorce. The pregnancy is also no longer on the table.

Now my family has been blowing up my social media calling me all sorts of shit. I’ve in general called them shit back as well and the home might be on the market soon. My sister needed to switch apartments and got a restraining order against her ex and well… things aren’t great, but I’m happy my sister is better. So AITA?

Edit: I messed up a date and fixed some grammar.

Edit: Wow, I just woke up and did not not expect a response like this. Thank you everyone, this helps a lot!
I saw a couple of posts mentioned they had been in the same predicament as my sister and I’d really like to say that you aren’t alone. Please, please reach out to those you have ever been close to.",nta
"title: AITA for my views on my friend after what they said to my other friend?
content: I want to be as anonymous as possible, so I will not be saying genders or ages, we are all in our 20s.To start off, I’m oblivious and simple. This is the main reason I’m making this post because I don't know if I’m in the wrong.

Mill and Harley (fake names) are 2 friends of mine. Both of them are of a similar race. For anonymity, I'm going to refer to races as types of birds. Both Mill and Harley are ""partially"" *Eagle*, not ""fully"" *Eagle* (this is important later).

I like to goof off (which has caused issues due to my obliviousness, my friends have confronted me about it before and I'm super appreciative of it). With that being said, my friends are also goofy. Some of us (me included) have a dark, self-deprecating sense of humor, Harley being the darkest.

We have a group chat with other friends. One day, a friend posted a flier about an *Eagle* Festival. Harley replied with something along the lines of ""The festival of my people"" and Mill just went OFF on them in the group chat. Saying things like ""Um, you're only like 1/4 *Eagle* so stfu"" (Paraphrasing, not exact message. Tried to go back to find the messages, but I guess my phone's text memory doesn't go that far back.) Harley wasn't too phased by Mill's comments. They didn't get mean, angry, or apologetic, but were being silly about it instead (I think to try to lighten the mood back up or maybe they didn't know Mill was seriously upset). I texted Mill privately to ask if they were serious, they were. For our chat, I do have exact texts since our chat doesn’t go too far back, so I want to use exact words (personal details replaced).

OP: Not gonna lie, you sounded a bit hostile in the chat

Mills: Bc they’re trying so hard to hang on to that ¼ *Eagle* which they don’t even celebrate. I’ve heard them make hella racist *Eagle* jokes (keep in mind we’ve only interacted like 5 times) and tbh coming from someone who’s more *Hawk* than *Eagle* is really offensive. Bc I dealt with that shit my whole life even adulthood. They may come off as mixed but they have no right to be making those types of jokes bc I doubt they’ve experienced the same things I have.

This is where my AITA judgment comes in. I interpret their message as “They don’t look *Eagle* enough, but I do, so I’m allowed to celebrate it and they’re not” which feels pretty racist to me, but I could be wrong. The thing is, Mill isn’t even “100% *Eagle*” either, but does “look” more *Eagle* than Harley. Now, for the racist jokes, I have no memory of them. I don’t think Mill ever hung out with Harley without me being there too. Something about Mill is they’re a tad touchy when it comes to *Eagle* related things. Now I see Mill differently. I’ve admittedly been a little distant with Mill and I think they’ve noticed because they get upset with me a lot more easily now. Am I and Harley wrong and is Mill right? AITA?

TL;DR: I think my friend is wrong, but I’m not sure?",yta
"title: AITA for nagging my Mum about a TV show?
content: So my Mum (53) and I (15) recently took a holiday together and during the flight back I convinced her to watch House of the Dragon (I’ve already watched it). She really enjoyed the first 5 episodes and so she finished the series of the next couple of days after we were back home.

She really enjoyed the show and so after the finale ended I instantly loaded up Episode 1 of Game of Thrones (the show’s chronological sequel) and she watched it and enjoyed it. We manage to get past the nudity by having me turn around or stuff my head in a pillow. The 18+ parts of the show are not causing the issue here.

Anyway it’s all going well so far, right?

Well then it took about a week of me asking her to watch it before she finally agreed to watch Episode 2. I don’t see what was stopping her from wanting to watch it, she said she was busy. However, after agreeing to watch the second episode, my mother only got halfway through before she ‘became busy’ again. It then took another week of me begging her for her to agree to watch Episodes 2 and 3. That was 2 weeks ago, we are yet to continue.

Let me explain the issue here. I’d understand if she were too busy or too stressed from work to watch it with me. What annoys me is that she seems fine to watch any other show possible. We live in England and yet somehow she’s managed to watch 3 whole MLB games. She also watched an entire musical with my sister. She’s continuing all of her other series and she’s even starting new ones. Yet every time I ask her to watch Game of Thrones she tells me the reason she won’t watch it with me is because “[I] keep asking too much and nagging [her]”. She also only works part time at the moment and I’ve told her numerous times that I’m happy for her to watch it while i’m at school.

I’m only nagging my mother because it is annoying me that she seems happy to watch anything else with anyone else but won’t watch anything with me. We’ve watched loads of similar shows over the years and she has never had an issue with those shows or me asking her daily if we could watch an episode.

It seems that every time I ask I have a lower chance of watching it with her but if I don’t ask she just won’t watch it with me.

AITA? This has been annoying me for weeks.

EDIT: She insists she enjoys the show and she really liked House of the Dragon.",yta
"title: AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?
content: My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.

SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.

Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?",nta
"title: AITA for no longer letting my coworkers use my assistive technology to make their documents accessible?
content: I would like to know if refusing to let my coworkers use my screen reader and accessibility software makes me an asshole?

I am totally blind and my job has provided me with a laptop that has a screen reader and other accessibly software. I work for an agency of the provincial government and all of our documents, forms, reports ETC. must be accessible under the AoDA. We are supposed to use the accessibility tools and checkers in Adobe or Microsoft office or whatever software we are using.

A while ago one of my coworkers was running late to an important meeting. He asked if he could run the report through my text to speech software because it would identify any defects or accessibility issues quickly. He said it would be faster than having use the accessibility checker in Adobe and it would really help him out because he was already running late. I was new and I didn't want the reputation of being difficult and he seemed like a nice guy so I agreed.

But now all of my coworkers want to use my software instead of manually checking it or using the checker in Adobe or whatever other software they created the document in. They all tell me that it is quicker this way and less of a pain than doing it manually. I get requests to run their documents and reports through my software all the time.

Right now my division is kind of self sustaining because the division head, who would be my boss, retired right before I started here. Technically we are reporting to the director but he is really hands off because the division is running itself fine. I want to know if telling my coworkers they can't use my accessibility tools anymore makes me an asshole? I said no to someone the other day and she and other people got upset. They accuse me of not being a team player and they say it is so much easier to use my software instead of the checkers and accessibility tools in Adobe or wherever they made their documents.

I have worked here for a month so I'm the newest and most junior person. I do want to be a team player. But it bothers me when my coworkers complain about how annoying it is to use the accessibility tools to make their documents AoDA compliant. I also do not like thr constant requests because it interrupts my work. This is my first full-time job and first time working in an office and only the second job I have ever had. I am still learning office etiquette and I do want to be a team player. But my software wasn't meant for this task and I don't like being bothered all the time with the requests.

EDIT: I think there is some misunderstanding about my laptop and accessibility needs. My setup is elaborate and it is expensive. It not just a matter of downloading something or getting a licence. Software like Adobe has an accessibility checker. My coworkers just do not want to take the time to use the checker and do it manually. There is no way the government would pay for another expensive setup like mine just because my coworkers want to cut corners.",nta
"title: AITA for no wanting to go to my HS graduation?
content: I’m sure this is a recycled topic however, I (18F) am a dual citizen of both the USA and New Zealand. I lived majority of my life in NZ and moved to the US when I was 15 and the exact moment covid started so I haven’t made any friends pretty much at all. My freshman and sophomore year were both online with my junior year being regulated, desks far apart and masks on which made talking and making friends very very hard. Senior year has been… interesting. I have made some friends but they’ve never talked to me outside school or made the effort, neither have I. This whole year I’ve never attended a single seniors event, haven’t taken my senior photos due to severe body dysmorphia, haven’t done any school spirit type activities and this is mostly due to my very severe social anxiety and the lack of having any friends. I haven’t had any negative experiences but I haven’t had any positive because I am super anxious 24/7. Back to the point of this post, I don’t want to walk the stage. I feel like there’s no point. I have no friends, my name will be called and people won’t know who I am, they will only clap because they have to which I know is a regular thing but it hits harder when it’s high school and mostly everyone knows each other, besides me of course, and these events don’t really matter to me as a whole but mostly my anxiety and grudge almost against my time at school is stopping me from going. However, my parents really want me to go and that’s why I’m here in the first place. People say the day you’re born they’re waiting for this moment and it upsets me. I have older parents (both 60) and my dad who never graduated high school and my mom coming from a very low funded school in The Bronx. She wants me to go and I know if I said no she would be able to move on at some point but she wants me to do it but mentally I can’t. It’s not something I want to do, I’m on no anxiety medication, I have a speech impediment and we all have to say a couple of words regarding our time at school and being in photos is very hard on me. I’ve promised that I am 100% walking the stage at college because I’m so excited for that part of my life but high school has truly been miserable with my senior year being a bit more tolerable.

"title: AITA for not agreeing to a name change for my daughter, despite her father wanting one?
content: My ex and I were engaged, living together, and planning on trying for kids after the wedding. The wedding got delayed and I found out I was pregnant shortly after. My ex freaked out. Insisted it couldn't be his baby because he wasn't ready to be a dad, that this was all happening too fast and wasn't how we planned it, and said he needed some time to think everything over. He then moved out, blocked me, and didn't answer any kind of attempted contact for 10 months.

Our child was born without him there and I named our daughter, ""Elizabeth Laura Smith"" without his input. Elizabeth because I like it and it reminds me of my favourite book character (I work in literature), Laura after my grandmother, and Smith is my surname. My ex has reached out. He said he waited this long because he wasn't sure how far along I was when we were together but he figured the baby had to have been born by now. I said that his timing was a little off, because she's 5 months old.

Ex has said he's planning to sort out custody. We've not discussed logistics yet, but he's unlikely to get anything before she turns 1. He asked if I'd named her yet, and I told him what I'd named her.

Ex then said he hates that name. He thinks it sounds old and stuffy. He says that as his mother, ""Mary"", has recently (November 2019) passed away, he wants to name our daughter Mary. He says Mary *must* be the first name and that I can have either Elizabeth or Laura as the middle name.

I made clear, in no uncertain terms, that I will not change her name. I hate the name Mary. I hate how it sounds, both alone and with ""Elizabeth/Laura Smith"" on the end of it. Plus I didn't like his mother, either (though I didn't remind him of that).

Ex said that if we're going to co-parent then I have to learn to compromise and this is the place to start, and that it's unfair that I got to choose both her first and middle name.

I said that if he hadn't blocked me for the better part of a year, he'd have been able to say all of this when she was born.

Ex said that the above is proof that I'm being petty and that he can't undo the past, but I can prevent any feelings of dislike/resentment from him over this name in future, and that as the father he should have a say in his daughter's name. He also says that he's willing to let her be a ""Smith"" and not force me to use his surname, which he feels is proof he has already negotiated.

"title: AITA for not agreeing to pay my friend for her time/gas when she offered to pick up edibles for me?
content: Hello Reddit, long time reader, first time poster. I (32 F) have a friend (27 F), let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for about 4.5 years, ever since I moved to our city from my home state in 2018. Lately, we’ve both been pretty busy with work and life, etc. so don’t see each other often, but text on and off and keep in touch every few days. 

Recently, we were chatting via text about our weekends, and she mentioned to me that she was in Illinois and about to hit up a dispensary, did I want her to grab me anything while she was there? I said yes please! After quickly cruising the website I picked a few items and sent them her way asking if that would work. $50 exactly. I then said I’d send an extra $10-$15 to cover taxes, and of course thanked her. She texted back saying “can you do $30 extra? For my gas and my time?” I was a little confused by this because a) she was already going to the dispensary, it’s not like I asked her to make a special trip for me (or even knew she was out of state in the first place), and b) she had offered to pick them up herself. I texted her back lightheartedly and asked “aren’t you already there? Lol” to which she replied, “hahaha well mama gets to pick her price tbh haha”. At that point I told her I was good this time around but thanked her for the offer. She was pretty short with me after that, and we ended our conversation.

We haven’t spoken since, and it’s been almost a week. I know it’s not a lot of money, and it’s not even about the money to me. It just feels like this is a common theme with her as of late and it’s beginning to feel like my kindness is being taken advantage of. I spoke to my sister and a different friend and they both think I’m not the asshole, and that she was trying to squeeze extra money out of me under the guise of niceness, but I tend to have a people pleasing nature and get caught up wondering/feeling like i’m in the wrong. So Reddit, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not allowing my family to visit my mother with Alzheimer’s?
content: My (54M) mother (77F) lives in a dementia care facility. She has been living there for a little over two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 4 years ago. My brother Todd (51M) has always been mom’s favorite. He didn’t move out of her house until his early 30s because of his “mental health issues”. He was always a bit of party-goer and spent his early 20s getting high and relying on our parents to take care of him. Because of this, our mom has always been over-protective of him and has always catered to his every need. When our father passed away in 2014, our mom signed paperwork to make me her Power-of-Attorney when she were to need it because I have always been more responsible and mature than Todd and he could not be trusted with that responsibility. 

A little over a week ago, Todd visited our mom and a few days later I visited her. When I was at the facility, a nurse told me that my mom did not recognize Todd and was upset someone she did not know was in her room. I then told the facility’s administrator that she is to not have any visitors other than me. As her POA, I feel it is my responsibility to make sure she feels safe and happy where she lives. Since she does not recognize family a lot of the time and could get upset when someone she doesn’t recognize is in her room, I told the facility staff to not allow any visitors except for me and my wife. We are the ones who see her the most and are the ones that are most involved with her care. 

This is not something I wanted to do, but it’s what I felt I had to do to preserve my mom’s happiness as much as possible. Now my brother and his daughters (my nieces) have been calling and texting me constantly for the past week calling me an asshole for not allowing them to see their mom/grandma. I explained to them that this isn’t about them, it’s about my mom and what is best for her. But they are not understanding that and insist they should be able to visit her even if they do not recognize her. I offered to have them video call her (the facility has tablets they let residents use to video call family) but they said that’s not the same and are still calling me an asshole for not allowing them to visit. 

I think it is my job to do what’s best for my mom, and having visitors in her room that she does not recognize is clearly upsetting to her, but all of the backlash from my family has made me second guess. AITA?

Edit: since this has come up a lot, my brother and his family are welcome to visit my mom with me there. They do not like this solution because my brother works nights and it is hard for us to find times when we are all available.

"title: AITA for not allowing my husband to give my daughter's phone to my MIL?
content: My MIL has leukaemia and has been in and out of hospital quite a lot for the past 3 years. It's especially difficult to get any updates on her condition when she is in hospital because she hasn't put my husband (her only child and only living relative) as her next of kin on her forms so the staff are reluctant to give him information. And she refuses to get a mobile phone. The last time she got out of hospital my husband told her how stressful it was trying to get information on how she was doing, and she told him that he would have to deal with it because she has no interest in getting a mobile phone.

When I got a new phone last year, I gave my 10 year old daughter my old one. She primarily uses it to upload YouTube shorts. She's been working at uploading every day recently and got her 9th subscriber and 100th view a few days ago - she was ecstatic and said she was going to keep building her channel and become a YouTuber. 

Tonight, my MIL phoned my husband and said she wanted his advice. She told him she'd been to see her GP, who told her if she didn't go to the hospital right away she wouldn't live to see the morning. She wanted to know what she should do. He told her it was obvious what she should do - go to the hospital! She said she didn't like the idea of going to the hospital and wanted him to give her an alternative. He told her to stop being ridiculous and get to the hospital ASAP. He asked her why the GP didn't arrange an ambulance if it was that serious, and she said she told the GP not to bother phoning an ambulance because she has a lunch tomorrow afternoon and she would have to make arrangements to reschedule it and also arrange for her dog to be cared for. 

After a few minutes of back and forth, she told my husband that she wasn't going to phone an ambulance and disturb the paramedics, that she would just see how she goes overnight and if she dies, she dies. My husband then said he would come over and bring her himself, to which she was very thankful.

My husband then came to me and asked where my daughter's phone was, I said it was in her room and asked why. He said he was taking it to give to MIL while she's in hospital and I told him he wasn't.

I told him that 1) it was my phone and I gave it to our daughter. 2) if MIL wanted a phone, she's had more than enough time to get one. 3) Our daughter would feel like she was being punished by having her phone removed, and 4) if MIL wanted him to have information about her while she's in hospital, she'd have made him her next of kin. He has made it clear to her how difficult it is for him to get information, but she hasn't done anything to make it easier. 

He got really angry with me and said I'm being difficult and he's left in a huff with me. 

I rang my mum to vent and she said that I should have given over my daughter's phone, but my dad said I was absolutely in the right. Now I'm conflicted.

So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not allowing my neighbor to use my driveway?
content: I (34F) have been living in my current house for about four years. It's a lovely neighborhood, and I generally have a great relationship with my neighbors. However, there's one neighbor, Dave (45M), who has been causing some issues lately, and I need some perspective on whether or not I am the asshole here.

Dave and his family moved into the house next door about a year ago. They have a narrow driveway that can fit only one car, and their house doesn't have much street parking available. This hasn't been a problem until recently when Dave started hosting large gatherings at his house.

During these gatherings, Dave's guests would park their cars on the street, which would quickly become overcrowded. As a result, some of his guests started using my driveway without asking for permission. Initially, I let it slide because I didn't want to cause any conflict. However, it began happening more frequently, and on a few occasions I'd be unable to move my own car when I had to go to work or leave for my own business forcing me to go to Dave's house and play a guessing game for someone to move their car.

I decided to address the issue with Dave, explaining that I didn't mind his guests occasionally using my driveway, but I would appreciate it if he could ask for permission first. Dave seemed understanding and apologized for the inconvenience.

However, the situation didn't improve. Dave continued to host gatherings, and his guests continued to use my driveway without permission. I decided to take matters into my own hands and placed a ""No Parking"" sign in my driveway, along with a polite note asking Dave's guests to respect my property, also with a warning that'd I'd have their vehicles towed.

Last weekend, Dave hosted another party, and his guests were forced to find alternative parking due to the sign. Dave confronted me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I should be more accommodating to his guests. He argued that it was just for a few hours and that I was creating unnecessary tension in the neighborhood.

I stood my ground, explaining that I had tried to address the issue politely, and that my driveway is my private property. I added that he should have respected my request for permission and made better arrangements for his guests' parking.

Ever since then me and Dave have not spoke to each other with him and his family most of the time shooting me a bad look.

So, AITA for not allowing my neighbor to use my driveway for his guests, despite having tried to address the issue politely?",nta
"title: AITA for not answering work emails while on vacation resulting in the loss of a client?
content: My husband and I took a much needed vacation to the beach last week and the entire week before we left I sent emails arpund letting everyone know I'd be completely inaccessible for the week so to come and see me for any work materials needed, files etc. I gave everyone everything I knew or thought they'd need and left confident that everyone had prepared themselves, seeing as I'd given them 8 days to prepare.

When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.

In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.

I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.

"title: AITA for not asking my friend enough questions about her wedding, and therefore being uninvited??
content: I have been friends with this girl for 10 years. At one point best friends, but we have drifted, which can happen naturally. Most of my friends I sometimes don't speak to for ages, but when we see each other, it's all good.

Now over a year ago, I was cooking us dinner in my flat, and she told me she was getting married! There was lots of happy talking about it into night. She sent me a save the date, which I replied to saying I was excited. I then sent her an engagement pressie (artwork of the word 'love' in sign language, as she’s learning BSL). Since then, we've seen each other once or twice, but we haven't spoken explicitly about the wedding. I've made a big deal over the ring etc, but we've talked about other things. She's been with her partner about 12 years, and swore she wasn't a wedding person, so it wasn't really on my mind. And in this past year, my father got a serious medical diagnosis, my baby niece had something horrible happen to her, and I had to go to the police about an ex. Basically lots of bad stuff. I shared each thing with her once over the phone, and then we never spoke about them again. She didn't ask how I was, and I didn't actively share more.

Cut to today, I send her a message asking how the wedding prep is going, and wanting more deets as it's coming up, and she says, ""I haven't actually sent an invite over. When I saw you last in Feb, you spoke about your work dates going over the wedding and didn't mention it, so assumed it wasn't a priority for you.""

So, i’ve been uninvited.

For context, we always have issues with communication. Although we get each other little gifts for bday and chrimbo, I am the type to leave people on read for 3-5 working days. I hate texting. I have no social media. I am an in person, on the phone, deep chats kind of person. My messages are either jokey, or short and sweet. She is the opposite. She sends long detailed messages that require a lot of emotional investment. Her complaint is i'm distant. I argue that I show my love in different ways, and communicating emotional things over text feels lacking in true connection. I'd rather call, but she doesn't like that unless it's planned.

Long story not really short, I am not invited to the wedding, and the friendship has now been mutually brought to a close. It all hinges on the fact that I didn't show enough interest in the day, and therefore was not committed to it. I mean, I truly don't know what more was needed.

I also feel kinda attacked by the way she laid out my character. She said ""What has my past 18 months been like? I suspect you probably can't answer that. Because unfortunately yes things have been a bit one way."" Which is mad because i recently sent her a long covid book unprompted, because she said she was suffering. If i'm honest, I do always feel like i'm walking on eggshells with her - like i'm never quite living up to her needs..

So. Give it to me straight. AITA? Am I a bad, selfish friend??

Thanks in advance!",nta
"title: AITA for not being able to attend my surprise bridal party?
content: I currently work full time, am a full time college student, while also getting married in June. I am graduating in just a couple of weeks, and all of my bachelor capstone assignments and papers are due in a couple of days. My mother and grandmother decided to plan a surprise bridal party today and covered it up as a normal family get together. When hearing about the family gathering, not knowing it was a bridal party, at the beginning of the week, I told my mother I would not be able to attend this weekend due to the amount of assignment I needed to work on. I was told to try and get them done as soon as possible, even though these assignments are a significant percentage of my grade in the class. Well, today was supposed to be the bridal party and when I reminded them I couldn't go to the family gathering, they finally told me it was actually a bridal party. I told them that I appreciated them putting the event together, but I should have been aware of the event ahead of time due to my tight schedule and the fact that I hate surprise parties all together. My mother and father have been screaming at me over the phone, telling me I'm a horrible person for having to reschedule. But my assignments are less than a day away, and I only have a rough draft completed. I feel horrible, but If I want to graduate on time, I can't take the entire evening off to attend. I just pulled an all-nighter working on HW, I am tired and feel extremely pressured to attend even though I will be anxious the entire time about these due-dates.

"title: AITA for not being helping my best friend?
content: My best friend (22M) has always been there for me (21M), and has helped me multiple times and probably never said “no” whenever I needed his help.

We both go to the same college and are in the same class. I live very close to the college. My best friend lives far off. Plus, he was not in the city at that moment.

Today, it was really, really sunny & hot, and my best friend had to submit a printout of a fee receipt pdf. Because if he didn’t submit it today, he would have to pay extra fine the coming day and the fine was hefty. 

He asked me to submit that doc on his behalf at the college, but I declined his request, since it was really hot outside, and I was resting, and didn’t want to go out. He requested me 2 more times, but I still declined. He then proceeded to yell at me on the phone.

We’ve had multiple conversations about this. I am fully committed to him and would never do anything to hurt him or be unfaithful. Recently, I have started having feelings towards another person in my friend group but I do not in any way, express that or flirt with him or do anything of the sort. This does not change the fact that I love my boyfriend 100% and want to stay with him. But, I am, in a way, not being honest with him by omitting such a big thing due to not wanting to hurt him or making him feel not good enough or suspicious of me. Another reason is that he also hangs out with the same friend group quite often and this would cause a shift in dynamics and potential awkwardness between us. So AITA for lying by omission?",yta
"title: AITA for not being okay with this behavior
content: I(24F) was hanging in a hotel room with 4 “friends” and a stripper. I made a joke that offended one of the women. I immediately apologized as that was not my intention and thought it would be squashed. It wasn’t though because she kept going on and on about how offended she was.

I admit there was a lot of alcohol involved which I realized at the time so I suggested to her that we just speak about it the next day. She kept going off though.

That’s when D(31M) jumped in to defend the girl. He came and ran over to where I was standing and got into my face until I was pinned between him and the bed. He got very close to my face, screaming, and putting his hand in my face. He is maybe 5’11 ish and I am 5’0. I felt uncomfortable with the way he was behaving.

I kept calmly asking him if I could speak. I knew he hadn’t heard the joke and was simply jumping in for his friend without knowing anything. I knew this would all be dismissed if I could just speak. D refused though. He kept yelling very close to me and said I wasn’t allowed to speak.

Eventually, he did calm down and let me say my piece. When I did, he realized the whole thing was stupid and apologized which I forgave.

During all of this, their were 3 other males in the room simply witnessing this. 2 of them(B and M) were close friends with both D and I.

I forgot to say D and I have never liked each other. We just act cordial for the sake of the group.

I later told B and M that I was disappointed in them for letting a grown man scream in my face like that. They said they didn’t want to get into the middle of it. I explained that I did not want them to defend me, but they should’ve had D take a step back out of my personal space. I explained that is threatening for a man to do that to a woman and them, as men, should not have allowed that.

AITA for thinking they should’ve had him back up? 

This was over a month ago and I thought it was done until D texted me last night to say I was acting like a victim and his actions absolutely were not aggressive

*update for my joke. I am black as well as one other person. The stripper was Hispanic and everyone else was white. The stripper wanted everyone to dance and everyone refused except me and the other black person. I said “not the POC being the only ones dancing. This is racist.” I said it was a smile on my face and laughed. I didn’t think that would be interpreted as anything but a joke because how ridiculous would that be to call someone racist for that??",info
"title: AITA for not being there to take care of my siblings for 1 day
content: So I (m20) still live at home with my parents cause of the horribly high housing prices but I technically live in a seperate room from the house thats outside and up some stairs. I also have 3 siblings: M(12) F(9) and M(7). Now that thats out of the way I'll get on with the story

So my mom recently started helping out my aunt with her selling business where she goes out to sell every morning but my mom only goes on select days to help her out. On these days I take them to school, the younger ones at 8:15 and the older on at 8:30. Then I go to work immediately after. I work every weekday but generally like the weekend to relax so I hang out with my GF. (also 20 and lives with her parents) only bad part is she lives an hour away from me so we usually hang out Friday evening until Sunday night and she stays over at my house

On this Sunday though I decided to sleep over at her place since we get home pretty late and I'm basically dozing off at the wheel sometimes plus its raining so I decided to just crash there for the night since I have done so before but before my mom started helping my aunt

I get a text from her saying who was going to stay with the kids and I forgot and didn't realize they'd basically be alone for 2 hours while I drove back and apologized, I leave pretty early in the morning so I still have time to get home and take them to school but they'd just be alone for awhile since my dad also works very early( for the record they both leave at 4am)

My mom then texts me that I can never do a favor for nothing. That kinda hurt since I'm still taking them to school I'm just not gonna be there for 2 hours while they sleep and I do it all the time for her and never once complained or asked for anything in return, plus I'm not there with them in general anway since I'm in a separate room and office type soace away from the house in the first place so they're still technically alone in the house to begin with. Id understand her frustration more if this was for her job but she's also just doing a favor for my aunt  so its not like she needs to go as well but

"title: AITA for not bringing my BF to my parents house
content: I am (29F) and my BF is (23M). My family are first generation immigrants from Taiwan, and I came here where I was 18, slightly more westernized while my parents are very conservative.

My BF is American Caucasian, he is a good person overall, slightly childish sometimes but it’s cute I guess. I currently work to support his law school.

Now as we try to get more serious about our relationship, I took him several to my parents house to visit, it’s important in my culture. 

Now my BF is very political and loves to debate to tooth and claws. I guess it typically doesn’t bother me because I largely let him do his thing cos that’s how my dad is. But when he visits my parents, my dad is basically opposite ideology of him and from a different culture with a different communication style, they go head to head every single time. When my dad complains about inflation, my BF immediately talks about how U.S has best inflation management and Asia could learn from it, in a rather ignorant tone. In our culture we hold some respect or courtesy for elders.

So it happened a few times, and last time got my dad face all red and coughing, I thought he was going to have a heart attack.

"title: AITA for not bringing my family to a company event?
content: I (33M) have been working at a company for around 5 years.  I was recently promoted to supervisor in a department of 25 other engineers.  I am one of the highest-performing employees in the department, and at work, I’m also one of the most social.  I’m an introvert, but I am OK at “playing the game” within the confines of work and I genuinely enjoy being around many of my coworkers.  Due to other employees’ lack of initiative, it usually falls to me to plan the social outings, which are normally at a bar or bowling alley or something.  Only around half of my coworkers have kids, and most of them are younger than mine and there are only a few.  I drive ~35 minutes to work, which is farther than most of my coworkers (I don’t mind this).

I have a wife and 3 kids, ages 4, 10, and 14.  I value separation between work and home life intensely, and I leave exactly at 4:00 pretty much every day.  I normally come in around 6:30 and work through lunch, which might not necessarily be healthy, but it’s the way I balance things out.  My wife is more introverted than I am and not comfortable talking a lot to people she doesn't know. English is also her second language.  We generally try to avoid social events where we can’t blend in with the crowd, but if it’s something related to the kids we oblige for their sake and we do alright.

Up until now, during my time at the company, we have never had a work event on a weekend, or where family was included.  My boss has mentioned a few times that he and his wife would like to hang out with me and my wife outside of work.  This has never gone too far so I’ve always been able to play it off (Covid helped).  My wife has made it clear she is not interested in this.

At a supervisor’s meeting today, my boss said he was organizing an event for a Saturday next month at a local park.  There are walking trails and a picnic area at the park, and he’ll be providing hot dogs and drinks.  He mentioned that families are invited, and after saying that, he looked at me and said “I expect your family to be there.”  I was unprepared for how direct this was, and blurted out “there’s no fucking way they’re coming.”  He guilt tripped me after that, saying “what do I need to do, hand-deliver an invitation?” and some other things like that.  I was pretty angry and don’t remember most of the specifics.  After some arguing I said I’d try to bring my youngest child and the matter died, but it really offended me and I was fuming the rest of the day.

I have some issues doing anything work-related on the weekend, but I think it’s really unfair to put me on the spot for my family not wanting to attend.  If he had asked in a different way, or just let the event play out, I might approach it differently, but as it stands I’m digging my heels in and ready to fight back if it comes up again.  AITA?",nta

She and I met through my then boyfriend but had gone to the same high school & never met. We became what I believed be friends over the years (4) and we'd spend time out with each other occasionally, talking on the phone daily. Most phone calls would be her complaining about her relationship & I'd give advice. I was never invited to gatherings she had at her house but she was always invited to mine. Over some time, my now husband & I would bump heads as direct results of things she and her boyfriend were dealing with. Usually pitting us against one another because he was her bf friend also. I was told at some point some nasty things she was saying about me to outside ppl but she was still calling me for advice. I decided to pull away some just to avoid issues in my marriage but later cut all contact bc I was being spoken about badly and false claims made all coming from her secretly. Now she's going thru a pretty bad spot in her life with her bf with him having gotten another woman pregnant.

"title: AITA for not caring about my dads strokes
content:  On mobile so sorry for punctuation.

Lets jump in, gonna be vauge on details because I dont know who knows my reddit in the fam.
15 years ago i was diagnosed with a rare disease that put me in the hospital. Full renal failure, pills for the rest of my short life, and no hope for anything really. My parents had divorced 4 years earlier so its dad and his gf, mom and step dad. I lived with mom.
I went home after 3 months and my numbers gradually improved. By the time i was mid way through 17 i was off dialysis with just a daily med regiment and monthly checkups. By 20 i wasnt even on the meds anymore. 
When I was out of the hospital for a few weeks, 3 things happend.
1)My dad sweet talked naive me into moving in with him(ploy to get out of child support)
2)somehow I was emancipated(I remember signing alot of stuff I didnt understand, talking to people I didnt know, it was all foggy and hazy from the drugs i was on) I have been told it wasnt 100% legal
3)my dad started cashing the insurance checks into an account he opened with me, in my name.
It was a paradigm shift in treatment when he got what he wanted, looking back I was almost overnight ostracized, and he went back to caring for his new family. I was just one more plate at dinner(theres alot more but i am trying to make this part short)
Long story short i ended up with about 176k in debt, i didnt know about till I turned 18.
 he kicked me out on the spot. Like mid december i turn 18 and bam, out in the cold with the door locked.
So I go back to moms, and then get the first bill in the mail.
I took a traveling gig that paid amazingly(2.5k a week) saved and saved and saved. made some choice auto flips for massive profit and settled with the debt collector at 122k lump sum payment. After 6 years and so much time lost, i was free. And I RESENTED MY FATHER.
 I watched on facebook as my friends had bonfires, went camping, fishing, they got married. And I was working like a fiend.
Fast forward to last year, I fell into remission and now am in need of a kidney transplant myself. after 15 years of nothing it progressed to this point (i always knew this would happen eventually. we concluded it was time for dialysis as well. That ball is rolling thank god)

my little sister(the only one who still talks to dad) gets prego. Invites everyone and BAM! I come face to face with the man that took 6 years of my life.
And I felt
Nothing. Just apathy. I was braced for anger, rage, sadness, hurt, betrayal. But I felt nothing.
Fast forward again to last month, and my sister calls Me and tells me to sit down. Dad has had a few strokes. He is doing well now on pills to help stabilize him.  but his years of drinking have caught up to him. And I just cant muster up the energy to care.
Am I an asshole for just not caring? Does this make me a sociopath for feeling nothing?

"title: AITA for not celebrating my own birthday?
content: Today is my birthday. I don't like celebrating my birthday, seriously, I hate it. I hate the attention, I hate being older, I hate to act like I'm happy, etc etc etc. I celebrate other people's bdays, but I prefer mine with a quiet day alone of doing things I like to do and eating things I like, yes I'm weird.

For the past 10 years at least, I have told my few friends, so my friends tend to leave me alone and just send me a quick happy bday msg which I appreciate... except my mom. She cannot comprehend it. 1 week before I'll tell her no thanks I'm good, 3 days before I'll tell her no thanks, 1 day before I'll tell her seriously no thanks. This is seriously not the first time, but I'm seriously getting really tired.

Queue to today morning, again, another phone call, ""What you doing today? Why aren't you having lunch and dinner with ppl having fun?"" I said no. It's my birthday, there is no dinner or lunch cuz it's exactly how I made it, I want a quiet day.

Queue to 4p, I was 1/3 way on my bike route, security told me somebody broke into my house, security alarm blaring. Found out my parents went into the house with the emergency key. Frantically turned off alarm, called and she said: ""Where are you, we are going to dinner, I called your brother they are coming, got you a bday cake, some presents, come home now we will wait for you at your house we are gonna celebrate"". 

Ugh. I got pissed on the bike trail. I said WTF. What part of what I said in the last week or 10 years did you miss? Got into an argument. Ended up ending bike route early, went home with day 30% ruined.

Got home 45 mins later, mom and dad were there, dad was trying to be nice just said they brought food but mom was like ""you are ruining the day, how dare you, ok it's my fault (mockingly)"" and left. Day 60% ruined.

They left then the phone rang. Queue my brother lecturing me for another 30mins of ""how dare you disrespect your elderly parents, it is what they want"" (we are Chinese), ""they are old they might not live to celebrate your b-day next year how dare you"", ""you should've just sucked it up and celebrated"", ""you should respect their wants it's not up to you it's the family"". Day is officially 90% ruined with lingering guilt that will haunt me for years to come.

Now I'm looking at the meal I planned for tonight that I originally looked forward to all day, simple sous vide steak with mushroom risotto. That remaining of today is really not as happy as it should, not sure if appetite is there anymore. Maybe I should've just sucked it up and fake happy thru the dinner instead?

"title: AITA for not changing my rules and terminating care?
content: I have a home daycare. I like to think I’m pretty lenient but I do have one big rule: Don’t make me the bad guy. I understand we might have different rules but don’t make your child resent me by not backing me up.

Anyway, another rule is I don’t allow outside toys or electronics. Kids can bring a stuffed animals for nap if they’re sleeping on rest mats but I don’t want to be responsible if something gets broken. Years ago, I used to let kids bring whatever. Then a cheap McDonalds toy broke by accident, kid was upset and mom got mad at me. So now it’s a hard rule.

Most are okay with it. But I have a new kid (3) who’s mom wanted him to bring his tablet because “he needs it”. I said sorry but no. I’m not going to be responsible for it. We went back and forth but finally she just says fine. But every morning, he’s crying because she took his tablet from him in the car. She always gives me this look and says “Miss Lucy says no tablet.” I always try to say we have plenty of toys, but the kids spends the whole morning sulking. I’ve talked to mom, asked her to leave it at home and not even put it in the car but she says he “needs it”.

It’s been a month and yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Kid came in crying as usual. I tried my usual redirection which didn’t work. Mom was giving me a look of “see what you did”. Then she had the nerve to say to him “I know you need your tablet, we’ve talked about this before, Miss Lucy is strict”. That pissed me off. I ended up telling her to take him home right then and there. She was shocked and tried to stammer. He was my first kid of the day so there was no scene. I just handed back his backpack, said he was no longer a student of mine and began to pack his extra clothes and the sippy cup he kept. Mom was in tears as she left.

My husband thinks she was right. I’m too strict and should’ve broken policy instead of causing drama. AITA?

Edit: There was no medical need for the tablet. It was all just that he wanted it.

Edit 2: I’m not making a waiver for electronics. That won’t stop other issues with the tablets, such as jealousy and drama.

Edit 3: Who reported to Reddit Care that you think I’m suicidal?? Where did you get that?

Edit 4: So my “don’t make me the bad guy rule” has been misunderstood, partly as I worded it poorly. I don’t expect blind obedience. No one has to agree with my rules. They can challenge them, to me. But to their kid, I’d rather them explain everyone has different rules and that while they’re with me, things will be different.

I do the same with parents who have different rules than mine. I never say they’re wrong or strict, I say that we have different rules at school and to listen to mom and dad.

This is also a policy for pacifiers, bottles and potty training. I’ll approach any of these milestones when you ask, but you have to be working on it at home too. The kid won’t progress if they only go pee on the potty at home.

And the child was not autistic or non verbal. If he was, an exception would be made.

I accept I’m TA for terminating with no notice. That wasn’t right.

Final update/edit: I returned her money for the last few days of January and texted an apology for terminating without notice and said I hope she was able to find care. She said she left him at her mom’s. She also asked if there was anyway I’d reconsider and I said no. We had a long phone call and no minds were changed, but it was the ending we SHOULD have had.",nta
"title: AITA for not cleaning while I cook just to prove a point to my husband?
content: I've always cleaned as I cook so that when it gets to the end of the meal, there's minimal mess. My husband is the opposite. When he cooks, it's like a bomb went off. I've encouraged him to clean as he cooks, and if we're doing a big meal/holiday meal together I often make sure to assign him that role.

Like most people, one of us cooks, the other one cleans up. I am the better cook, so I cook like 80% of the time. He gets an easy cleanup.

I'm busier than usual at work, so he's had to step up. Whenever he's done, the kitchen is a mess. I don't even get how it happens, there will be oil splatters untouched, stuff drying to dishes, peels and meat. I'm not about to let food sit out overnight so after I'm done eating I'll start the process and won't get to really relax much.

Last week I asked if he could please try cleaning as he cooks. He told me ""the rule is one person cooks, the other person cleans."" I said ""I get that but you're leaving me with a huge mess every night.""

He said ""I just don't have the time to clean up when I'm focused on cooking"" knowing full well I'll see him scrolling on his phone.

I just got so fed up, so on Sunday I made a big pot of chili. I didn't clean up as I worked, when I was done, I served him, sat down, enjoyed a beer and dinner.

When he finally went into the kitchen, he said ""What the fuck? Why is there such a mess?""

I said that I was too busy paying attention to the chili to clean up. I started to get ready for bed. He was like, ""Uhh you're just going to leave this here?"" and I said yes. He said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a game with his friends later that night, so could I just clean up.

I said no, I cooked, so he has to clean.

Two days later he's still pissy with me because he ended up not being able game and told me that he didn't get enough sleep and was exhausted at work (not to be TOO snarky, but it's not like he's a surgeon) because I had to ""prove a point"" to him. I told him that nothing else seemed to get his attention, and I feel pretty justified. He told me I was being a smug asshole about it and it was childish.

AITA? Or is he?

**EDIT:** A couple of people asked how we can make so many dishes, it should take 15 minutes, etc. We don't have a dishwasher (there's no room for one), so everything has to be done by hand. Additionally, ""doing the dishes"" means cleaning up the counters and stovetop and sweeping the floor, taking out the trash if need be.

When I make chili, it's a process starting w/ dried chilies that I toast, soak, seed, pulverize, etc. Then there's cooking the dried beans, then there's the onions and garlic and the peels, any other veggies, seeding tomato, cans of tomato, grinding the spices, etc. Then there's grating cheese for the top, etc. It definitely left a ton of dishes and other stuff behind.

**EDIT 2:** Sorry guys I was reading comments as I was at work, I thought this would get like... 10 comments tops. So another thing that comes up is ""whoever cooks also cleans"" but since I cook most of the time, I just don't see that as being also fair to me. I'll end up spending almost every single day after work (I've been ending work at 6 or 7 some days lately) cooking AND cleaning. If I had him cook more I would definitely start to gain weight and then we'd have another issue altogether HAHAHAHA.

**FINAL EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Oh and sorry to the people on ""AmITheAngel"" for the ""humblebraggy"" way I mentioned I make chili. Didn't mean to make you guys feel inferior because I toasted a few chilies. Lmao. ""Oh it's so fishy because she used dried beans"" Makes sense why people are asking for my recipe if the concept of toasting chilies and using dried beans is so novel. Lmao.",nta

I haven't spoken to her in months and she loves to complain about pretty much anything and uses any excuse to go back to her home country since she doesn't like it here.

She says she misses her family and will use excuses such as me not talking to her as an excuse to go back. She said she needs to go back and 'can't stay here anymore' and she has to leave. My dad then started shouting at me saying how I am being rude and I should respect her (she doesn't like me either) and I should say hello whenever I see her (she can't speak English and I can't speak a word of her language and got all of this from my dad who speaks broken English).

"title: AITA for not contacting my friend
content: Honestly I think I might be. But I need advice!
English is not my first language. 
My (F28) friend (F24) recently found out she was pregnant. She became single about a year and a half ago and has since then been exploring the single life (as she should). We’ve had a lot of talks about birth control, as she uses none apart from condoms once in a while. I have explained to her that “pulling out” is not safe and she should take care of herself. 
She called me sobbing when she found out she was pregnant. She was screaming how stupid and naive she was, and I tried to calm her down and to not focus on that part right now. 
After she had calmed down she asked me for my honest opinion, if she should keep the baby or not. I told her if I was in her shoes, I would not keep it. She doesn’t know who the father is, she lives with her parents in a small apartment, has no education or stable income. I know she always wanted a family, but not like this. 
She went back an forth about getting an abortion, and she eventually started googling a lot. That led her to a dark space full of wrongful information. I tried to tell her not to listen to these things, and if she had any concerns she should call her doctor. 
She started to have second thought about the abortion, and kept asking for my opinion as if I might have changed my mind. After a week or so it all got too much for me. I tried to reason with her and tell her that she should not listen to fake news, but she only got upset with me. 
She ended up getting the abortion, and I texted her the day of and the following days. She did not want to talk about it, and started sending me tik Toks and videoed with all these fake news. I stopped responding since I don’t know what to say. But I’m left with a feeling that I talked her in to the abortion and now she regrets it. I have since heard from mutual friends that she is upset that I stopped replying, and I feel bad. AITA for not replying?",nta
"title: AITA for not cutting my hair to match my niece?
content: My (26f) brother Mike (29) recently moved near me because of work. We are now half an hour away from each other. We were 4-5 hours away most of our adult lives and usually only saw each other during Christmas at our parents’. Mike is living with his fiancée Sara (30f) and her daughter from a previous relationship Eve (6). Sara works from home as a freelancer.

Ever since the move I went to hang out at Mike’s a lot because I miss him. Sara and I got along OK, but Eve was attached to me from the start. She said I look like one of the princess dolls she has. Thus our friendship is born.

One of the activities Eve and I enjoy is styling our hair. Our hair is very similar: long, blonde, fine and super straight. We enjoy braiding, curling and ornamenting our locks, as Sara has had short hair all her life and cannot style her daughter’s hair beyond a simple ponytail. Eve loved it when I put our hair in matching styles and we often went to dinner like that. My brother and Sara thought it was adorable.

A few days ago an incident at school caused Eve’s hair to be damaged. Sara took her to the salon but the best they could do was cut and trim her hair to just above shoulder’s length. Eve was crying and really upset; she said she won’t get to play hair styling and have matching hair with me anymore since her hair is short now. She said it’s not fair that I will be the only princess in the family now. 

Sara called me and asked if I can cut my hair to match with Eve so she wouldn’t be sad. She said it will be a nice change of pace and our hair will grow back. 

I told her no. A trim of an inch is one thing but shoulder length is too short for my liking. Sara said I’m not being considerate as it’ll mean a lot to Eve to know her aunt matches with her. 

Mike said my hair my decision, but my mom said it would be a nice thing to do. I wonder if I’m AH.",nta
"title: AITA for not doing a second wedding for those that cant make it to/afford our destination wedding?
content: I recently got engaged, my fiancee and I never wanted a big wedding but we love to travel. We've decided were going to get married at an all inclusive resort that throws the wedding in for free with a week long stay. We'd be paying for the trip 100% ourselves. We thought we'd do it with just us but then my siblings said they'd want to go to. My fiancee is an only child and her parents arent around any longer so she doesn't really have family but her best friends said they'd come in too.

My parents dont love our plan but said they'd come for a day if we absolutely insist on doing this. But they also want us to do a hometown reception for extended family that wouldnt be able to afford the trip. We dont really want to do that because I hate making trips back to my hometown, its a very backwards place in a lot of ways. Also it would be 50 people from my fam and nobody from my fiancee's and that would just feel awkward.

I got a call from my mom's sister saying im being an elitist jerk for doing this knowing most of my cousins wouldnt be able to make the trip. I did get invited to all the weddings of my cousins that got married in the last few years so the tradition is to invite everyone, I just dont really want to follow that tradition. Were not really close, I dont even have most of their addresses to send invites if I wanted to.

"title: AITA for not doing something that my parents thought I would do
content: I wanted to go to a play that was at my school with a couple of friends. We planned on going to Dominoes beforehand but I didn’t tell my dad and step mom about until the day of the play. They said that it would be dangerous to go to Dominoes since it would be dark around that time (which it wasn’t). They called my mom to see if she would agree with them and she did. Even though the Dominoes is only across the street from my school they still thought it was dangerous.

When I got to school I walked in and snapped my friends a picture of me in the school. They immediately texted me to go to Dominoes but I said that I would get in trouble if I did. I still walked out of the school and met with one of my friends in front of the school. She tried convincing me to go with her into the Dominoes. But like I said, I didn’t wanna get in trouble. So I just went on the sidewalk with her and waved at my friends who were in the Dominoes. I stayed on the sidewalk of my school until my friends came out of the Dominoes. After that we walked back into the school and went into the auditorium to sit down to watch the play. After the intermission started, my dad texting me asking if the play was over and I said we were only in the intermission, my dad texting me again saying that he already sees people walking out and to get my butt to the car. I started getting pretty sad because I was having a really good time with my friends but I knew that I couldn’t disobey my dad so I said goodbye to my friends and I walked to the car. 

As soon as I got into the car, they started saying that I disobeyed their trust, and that they didn’t know if they could let me do stuff with my friends again. I got super confused and I asked him what I did wrong and they said that my stepmom saw me “going” to the Dominoes. Even though I didn’t, which is already one lie. My dad then started talking about how dangerous it is for teenage girls like me to be walking around and then he made my stepmom tell me a story about how she got run over by a car while crossing the road when she was sneaking out even though it doesn’t apply to me because I wasn’t on the road at all. Then he asked me if I knew what type of ladies stand on the side of the road and I asked what type of ladies and he said prostitutes, he followed up by saying “oh, I’m not calling you a prostitute.” But if he wasn’t calling me a prostitute, then why would he bring that up in the first place? Then he said that he knows that I didn’t cross the street but he also knows how a “ teenagers mind” works.

"title: AITA for not driving 4+ hours to see my sisters kids?
content: My sister has been having a hard time with her kids lately. She's been stressed and she's frustrated that no relatives are spending time with her kids more (or babysitting them) for her. 

Here's the thing: I do spend time with her kids. I see them probably about once a month or once every couple of months. I live 2+ hours away and visiting costs a lot on gas and time, and I'm incredibly busy as a senior in college with a part time job. I spent almost every weekend with her firstborn, but I haven't had near the free time recently. And honestly, I don't even want to. My family (mostly mom and dad but sister too) has a history of being toxic and stressful, so visits end in tears more often than not. I visit for holidays and other occasions but lately I've been avoiding the whole ordeal more for my own mental health.

I love my neices, dont get me wrong. I adore them. But I hate that she's acting like I have some kind of obligation to spend MORE time with them when I feel like I spend a normal amount considering how far away I live and how hard it is to travel in and out of Seattle where she lives. I don't have cash to burn on gas every other weekend, or the energy to spare babysitting her 2 yr old and 4 month old.

So I guess, basically, am I the a hole for not spending more time with her kids in spite of how much it stresses me out?

Update: I took some of your guys' advice and set a boundary. I told we might be able to aim for once a month visit-wise but I don't think its fair that she expects so much from me/is implying I'm a bad relative for not going out of my way. I'll let you know what she says tomorrow.

Update 2: A rare happy ending for this sub! My sister and I had a long talk and she realized how she was coming across/how demanding it was. Shes been stressed and was in a vulnerable place when she said everything before. We got to the heart of it and we agreed on doing video calls more often, since driving down is so difficult. At the end she actually DID just want to see me more/have me more involved with the kiddos, she just ended up venting some frustration my way. Yay communication lol",nta
"title: AITA for not dropping my son off at school anymore?
content:  

(This account is a throwaway, because people IRL know my main)

Me (48M) and my wife (44F) have been separated for 3 years now. We have not formally divorced because of reasons I will not go into. We have 3 kids, 'S' (M15), 'P' (M11), and 'D' (F8). Currently, all 3 kids stay over at wife's house on weekdays, and P and D come to my place on weekends. My relationship with S is somewhat strained, and so he chooses not to come over on weekends.

However, I have agreed to drop him off at school everyday, because he lives very far from it. It is approximately a 1 hour bus ride, but with me dropping him off, it would only take 20 minutes. It works out for me because I can drop him off at around 8:20, and get to my work on time. S is generally very quiet on our trips to school. He will put on the radio, or listen to music on the phone. Sometimes, we will go the entire trip without saying a single word.

Last month, S had a student free day, and he stayed home. However, I was not aware of this, and I came anyways. I waited outside his house for around 20 minutes, until I received a text from my wife who told me S had no school. This again happened last week. I got mad at my wife and told her this was impolite, and told her she was a horrible parent for not teaching any manners to S.

This morning, I was a little late and I got to their home around 10 minutes later than usual. Again, there was no one. I later found out that S thought I was not going to pick him up anymore, and took the bus instead. I was really angry at this, because this was the third time that this happened, and I told them I would not be picking them up anymore.

My wife blew up on me on the phone, calling me an AH for not picking up my son anymore and making life generally more inconvenient. She thinks I should keep up with my son's schedule and that I should know when his student free days are (there is a school calendar stating big events at the school, but I do admit that I don't check it very often). S now has to wake up around 30 minutes earlier to catch the bus on time. However, I think that until they change, I feel like I am being used. So here I am, asking for reddit's opinion on this.

"title: AITA for not enabling my mom
content: My mom has always been enabled by my dad my entire life. I remember when I was younger she ran into the back of another vehicle and my dad said to me , “it was your fault you were probably texting her while she was driving” even though I was at work. Another time she was using a blender and it started making a loud noise clearly indicating that the motor was stuck, she didn’t stop blending and my dad yelled at me to go help her. This confused me because clearly you could see and hear that something was wrong. Long story short she ended up breaking the blender and it was “my fault”. 
Fast forward to recently this has me questioning is this real or completely behavioral. She came over to my house, and I had to rush to go to a baby shower. She nicely offered to go get wrapping paper for me as I was getting ready. She returned home and started throwing items into my house and cursing. I asked her what’s wrong and she was furious with me that I wasn’t helping her bring items into the house. This confused me because I didn’t know she returned home and I was getting ready for the party. She said she feels like my slave, and I told her that all she had to do was ask me for help. 
My dad passed away recently, and when I was inquiring about the will. She looked at me angrily and said “he left you nothing, he left it all to me!” and suggested that I was spoiled for even asking. 
She was driving to a family event and my sister and I had a few glasses of wine before, so she was the designated driver. She pretended not to know how to use the GPS, even though she has one herself. I feel like she’s always pulling these stunts to try and provoke us to get frustrated with her and then she can feel like the victim. Things can never go smoothly because she seems to enjoy the drama of us getting frustrated with her for not knowing how to do something that we know she knows how to do. Another example of this is we came over to her house and it was like a hoarders house. She mentioned she was having a garage sale. She explained that she was really frustrated that we weren’t helping her get things ready for the sale. I found some childhood items of mine that I told her I don’t need anymore as I grew out them, she threw a fit and told me we can’t get rid of them. Every item I picked up she always had a reason not to get rid of. I felt frustrated because here I am trying to help her but yet she’s refusing and then angry at me that I’m not helping. I feel like I can’t win in the situation and that I can’t do anything, right.",nta
"title: AITA for not getting off my brothers pc
content: For Christmas, I think maybe 3 years ago, I requested a PC so that I could play games cause the laptop I had wasn't able to run any games at all. But instead, I got another, slightly better, laptop. It couldn't ( run games very well but I can have about three small 3 games. I just have to delete one when I want another. I was still appreciative even though it was not what I wanted cause I had assumed we either couldn't afford a PC or they misunderstood what I had asked for.

My brother's (13M) birthday rolls around and when I get woken up to watch him open his gifts I see a massive box in the corner of the room and as you can probably guess it was a PC. At first I thought maybe a shared PC scenario as I had asked for one aswell and thought maybe now we can afford one or something along those lines but nope, completely his, and my parents didn't even say something to me about it. Now I think they just didn't understand that I wanted a PC as well or just didn't care (my mother especially is very traditionalist so it's also a possibility she just didn't want her daughter playing videogames)

When he first got it he let me download three games of my own that I couldn't get on my laptop (Sims 4, Valorant, and Overwatch) but over time he started letting me play less and less until in about a month it became ""(my name) get the F out/off"". This caused problems as like once every 3 days I would try and play something and would get kicked off after 20 minutes but on some other days he would let me play for a good hour

Now today, my brother had gone out to the garden to play and I got on and started playing and I had started a challenge during which you cannot save, and you cannot leave without receiving a penalty. My brother came in and immediately said ""Get out"". I ignored him and kept playing so i could try and finish the challenge as fast as possible. He told me to save and quit repeatedly but I told him ""I cant"" every time until he pulled the plug on his pc which ended up logging me out of my account and deleting all my progress. He got our mum and she was screaming at me to get out and I got a 20-minute lecture that i didn't even try to dispute and just kept quiet

I started crying cause i was jut yelled at and lost all my progress in a game i poured so many hours into and then got yelled at again for crying. And now as I'm writing this I can hear my mum complaining about me to her friend on the phone.

"title: AITA for not giving my MIL Saturday dinners?
content: My husband and I have both sets of our parents living in the same city as us. We decided to have a weekly dinner with each set of parents so that we could see them regularly.

My parents get Saturday night. My sister, her husband and daughter also live in the same city and come to my parents house on Saturday as well so that we can all hang out

My MIL and FIL get Friday night. We spend our Friday evenings with them either at their house or ours

For a while now my MIL has been complaining about us giving my parents Saturday evenings. She thinks we’re favoring my parents by giving them Saturdays. Her reasoning for wanting Saturdays is that it is one of her days off and in turn she would have more time to prepare a meal for us. She wants to relax all day and then have us come over 

Currently my parents live 35 mins away from us on a good traffic day. If we were to go on any weekday evening it would take us upwards of 50 mins to an hour to get there. My In Laws live 10 mins away from us, it’s much easier to go over on a weekday. 

My mom does a fast for religious reasons every Friday and has for as long as I can remember. She only eats specific foods and has her meal about mid day therefore if we were to go over to my parents’ house on Friday she would have to just watch us eat

Also we can’t give my parents Sunday because we go to temple in the evenings.

We spend the same amount of time at each parent’s house. We don’t go to my parents house on Saturday and spend the whole day with them. We go there for dinner (about 2 hours) and do the exact same thing with my In Laws but on Friday and for the same amount of time

I gave it a try though, recently we have given my In Laws Saturday nights every few weeks. Never has dinner been made nor any sort of special meal my MIL claimed she needed the time for. I'm in the kitchen still helping her cook every meal once we get there. We spend the exact same amount of time there as we would if it were a Friday night. Everything is absolutely the same. 

This past week she complained again and I refused to give her Saturday. My husband agrees with my reasonings but he feels bad for her and thinks we should just do it for her. He thinks that I shouldn’t be holding onto this too much and I should just deal with the driving and my mom not eating and go to my parents on Friday even though Saturdays also work for my sister and I get to see my whole family at once. 

He thinks I’m being an asshole for not considering her feelings and not going to their house this past Saturday. I think the way things are (Fridays for my In Laws and Saturdays for my parents) makes it possible for us to have dinner and spend time with everyone, which was the point of all this in the first place

"title: AITA for not giving my brother and his wife any privacy?
content: My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.

For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.

It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.

This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.

I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. 

I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.

I admit I could have moved into one of the smaller rooms but was somewhat exited to have my own space complete with a three monitor desk setup, a comfy couch and several shelves of figurines I've collected/painted. As part of my job (coding) I often pace around the room for ideas and looking at these shelves (that take up about half the room) gives me alot of joy. 

Recently my wife who is a very creative person and has dozens of crafty hobbies that she jumps in-between outgrew her craft room that we set up soon after moving here. It's about half the size of my current office. We also have both a large guest bedroom and another similar sized small room that we currently use mostly as storage. I recommended she use the small room to set up a secondary desk and storage. I figured this could be nice since she often has several projects going at once and would have to store one away for the other(s). She however insists that a bigger room would be the only real choice. Whilst at first I tried to dissuade her from using the guest room since there's no way we can cram all the furniture in one of the small rooms and I'm also worried about our (regular) guests comfort I gave in. 

She seemed very happy with the decision however yesterday insisted that I move my office into one of the smaller rooms and let her have my current room so that our guests wouldn't have to sleep in a small space. I disagreed vehemently since I spent 50 hours a week in my office and have spent countless hours decorating it in the exact way I wanted it. I also actually use the extra space to be more effective and focused. 

Obviously now my wife is very angry with me and says the only thing that will calm her is if I give her the bigger room. I don't think this is something I can budge on. So Reddit, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not giving up my second ""free"" seat next to me in the plane?
content: I am obese. Like I am comfortable having two seats in the plane type of obese. I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. 

A week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. 

So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like ""Fucking fat bitch"" under her breath but nothing directly to me. 

So Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?",nta
"title: AITA for not giving up on attending a good school after my brother couldn't get in?
content: First of all, I have two moms, and I'll refer to them as mom (41F) and mama (43F).

In my country, we have these public schools that are kind of like a combination of regular high schools and community colleges. They offer a program that takes an extra year but grants you an equivalent of an associate degree. The catch is, you have to pass an entrance exam and score higher than other students.

My uncle (thirty-something years old, male) attended this school when he was my age, and he convinced me to attend it too. I (14F) studied during one year before the exam. During this time, my uncle checked on my studies at least every other weekend. His help made a big difference for me and I'm very grateful. But he wasn't going completely out of his way to help me. My uncle always visited our home because he's very close to my mom (his sister).

My brother (14M) is dyslexic. He was trying to get into the same school, but he couldn't pass the exam. Our moms even hired a private teacher to help him for two hours every Saturday. I'm not blaming my brother at all, he always struggled in school. He improved his knowledge so much during the last year, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough. I'm very happy at my new school, but my brother is miserable about his failure and his grades dropped significantly.

My uncle worked as a private tutor as a side job when he was young, but he didn't want to help my brother because he doesn't have any experience with kids who are neurodivergent.

Besides, my uncle bought a video game for my brother's birthday. It would be considered an expensive gift in my country, except my uncle bought a 10 times more expensive smartphone for my birthday. This made my brother resent me even more, and now he calls me ""golden niece"" whenever he's mad at me.

Now, my first semester at the new school is about to end, and my moms are really pressuring me to go back to my old school. Their argument is that I won't even use the degree I'll get from this program because I plan on going to college after high school. They say I'm just wasting a year of my life. Also, I’m making mom drive me half an hour every day to take me to school.

I complained about them to my uncle and they had a massive fight. My uncle said he would take the matter into his own hands if they forced me to drop out (I don’t know what he meant by that since he can’t really stop them).

Am I a selfish asshole for favoring a good school over my family?

Edit:
My brother and I aren't twins. I was born to our mama, while my brother was born to our mom.

My uncle is my mom's brother.

If you didn't understand, I'm using two different words for 'mother' to tell them apart.",nta
"title: AITA for not going out to help my mom while she was arguing with a neighbor?
content: Gonna preface this by saying that I'm 19, male, so I expect you all to hold me accountable. 

Over the past year, we've had issues with our neighbor who believes we have been invading his property. 

Because of his complaints, my parents built a fence separating our yards, which is within the boundaries of our property. Ever since then, he's been passive aggressive towards us.

Getting to the story, my father was out at work and my mom went to walk our dog in our front yard (I was asleep at the time). She was standing right at our border with the dog on a leash, and our neighbor started yelling at her saying ""Don't you dare bring that dog on my yard"", my mom yelled back and said ""Shut up"" (This is how my mom explained it to me since I was asleep).

Right then I woke up from the yelling and looked outside to see them yelling at each other. I heard them yelling things like ""F you"" to each other (from a distance of about 30 feet). My mom said ""Why don't you yell at my husband like that?"". To which he just kept yelling and saying insults. At one point he said something like  ""All you american people"" or ""All you white people"". My neighbor is Jamaican, but my mom is Puerto Rican, she's not even American, although her skin could mistake her for being white.

Throughout all of this, I was looking at the situation through a window and I just went right back to sleep while this was happening. 

In general, my mom can have a short temper, she is usually very rash with her decisions and she often lashes out at my siblings. When my siblings do something wrong, rather than seeing it as a parenting opportunity, she just gets mad and yells at them as loud as she can, it usually gets very loud. It's like she scolds them because she's annoyed with them, rather than trying to teach them important lessons, which I have always disagreed with.

For these reasons, I seriously thought my mom was the one that probably started it. She said that he started it, but my mom lies a lot and exaggerates whenever she explains situations. I don't think i've ever seen my mom take the blame for anything that happens to her or the people around her. But I still love her and there is some truth in that our neighbor can be argumentative.

I think that conflicts like these are better solved by ignoring these people that you really can't reason with. So, I just stayed in my room as I don't agree with conflict.

But maybe i'm an a hole because as a son I should've gone out there and defended my mom, but instead I just went back to sleep like a scared cat.

After talking with her and explaining that she should've ignored him, she was mad at me for not going out and defending her. AITA?

Regardless, my parents want to talk to law enforcement about the situation now, but I really doubt anyone committed a crime, as it's just freedom of speech. And the cops probably won't do squat. I still think the best way to handle this is to ignore him.",yta
"title: AITA for not going to estranged father's funeral?
content: Ok, so a little bit of background. My mom and dad were young when they got married, and my father was a very conflicted and messed up individual. He was extremely abusive to my mom, and she got out of the relationship when I was about two years old. My mother gained full custody of me, but I was required to have visitation with him after they were divorced. He picked me up about 50% of the time, and the other times I was desperately hoping he would come. The lies and excuses kept mounting and mounting.

He had two other children, my half brothers, who are four and six years younger than me, (26f). 

When I was about 11 years old, my mom and I moved to NC. Dad agreed to come visit me, and I would occasionally talk with him on the phone. He visited me a grand total of 1 time. After a lot of deliberation, I decided to tell him I no longer wanted contact with him. I told him I was sick of the lies and excuses. He respected my request, and as a result I no longer had a lot of contact with his side of the family. I have talked here and there with my brothers, but barely any contact. I also cut off contact with my grandmother on that side, as she was pressuring me to reconcile with him. Fast forward fifteen years, and about 4 days ago I found out that my father passes away. Due to all of the past trauma and abuse from him--emotional--I am torn between reconnecting with his family and going to a celebration of life in  a couple weeks. I love my mother, but she is convinced it would only hurt me more if I went, but I do think it would help with some sort of closure.

"title: AITA for not going to my dad's wedding?
content: Background. My birth parents were together for 21 years. They got my brother (34) and myself (32f) out of the situation. It wasn't good at the beginning and same goes for the end. Throughout their entire relationship they did a multitude of drugs together and cheated on each other constantly. Over the years my brother and I would be sent to my grandmothers for two years, then go back to our parents for two years, so on and so forth. ANYWAY! After 20 years, they got married then promptly got divorced. Soon after, my dad got with someone else. That relationship lasted for 15 years. Out of the blue, he told her they weren't working out, that he had been cheating on her with another woman but was going to cut it off. Turns out, it was TWO other women and he only cut it off with one. Not even a week later, he gets engaged to the other woman and now they are set to get married in two weeks. I rolled it around in my head for the last couple of months, but decided that I didn't want to make the 13hr drive to go to his wedding.

"title: AITA for not going to my friend’s house with her when she wanted to keep hanging out?
content: My friend Carol (29F) recently moved into an apartment in a nearby city. I (28F) live in the big city, to where she also commutes for the work on weekdays. Whenever we’ve hung out or gone out, it’s always been in the big city. Most of the time, she calls a car home and never takes public transpo outside of work. She lives in a developing area of her city, where you can take an Uber to an area 10 minutes away that’s more lively.

&#x200B;

For me to get to her place by public transpo, it takes about an hour and a half, requires 2 train lines in my city, a transfer to another train system, and then a third train system, followed by a 13 minute walk. This takes into account wait times at stations, during the day, where trains are more frequent. An Uber from her place to mine runs $70, possibly more given surges at night. I've told Carol I am open to coming to see her in the more lively area of her city as it would bring down the commute to an hour and I would only have to transfer between two train systems.

&#x200B;

We finally landed on a weekend and I went to meet her at a club in her city at night. I’ve hung out in this area before and know it’s not particularly exciting but didn’t want her to feel like she always had to come to me. An hour and some change in, Carol asks if we can go chill at her place because she’s bored, and offers to call the car, so we can watch a movie and do face masks. I say if we’re not staying walking distance to this area, I’d need to head back home. The commute with two train systems is cumbersome already at night, especially with trains running local and less frequently. She kept trying to sell me on it, she said I could just Uber back, but I was firm and she eventually called her car for herself and left.

&#x200B;

The next day, Carol texted me and said it bothered her that I ""wasn't there for her last night"" when she wanted to back to her place because she wanted to just relax.

&#x200B;

Some of her points seemed to be that she comes the city to hang out, even on the weekends when she's not just there for work and when she stays late, she just eats the Uber charge. My points are that (1) I did make the trek toward her on this particular weekend, (2) when we are in my city, I keep hangouts closer to downtown to make the ride back easier for her, whether she chooses Uber or public transpo (though she's never done the latter), and (3) while I agree that after a particular time, I would prefer she take an Uber home, she's usually the one requesting for us to do those activities that keep us out late in the city, and when I request it, I never pressure her to come out when she says no.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'm also willing to come to her place for bigger occasions. If she had a birthday celebration at her place, I'd of course make the trip, whether it was by Uber or train, or her moving in, which I was there for to help her with. But to me, it rationally did not make sense to incur costs or inconvenience by such a multitude for a pretty casual hangout. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not going to my twin sister's birthday party because my parents are not letting me have one?
content: We both turned 16.

My parents have not been happy with my performance at school for the last couple of years so they decided that I won't get to have a birthday this year. I admit I haven't done all that well but I've tried as hard as she has, it's not like I'm screwing up on purpose or I'm a trouble kid. I haven't had any real trouble in my life.

Anyway, I just don't find it cool to have to come to a birthday party on my birthday so decided that I'll just not go. No drama, no entitlement, I just won't go and instead spend time with a couple of my friends (who weren't invited, so I didn't take any guests away from her party). I did tell my parents about my plans and they laughed me off and didn't take me seriously. 

So the birthday came and I didn't go. I got a gift for my sister and gave it to her before the party so she'd know me not being there is not because of ill feeling towards her. Got home late at night and my parents told me my absence was noticed by relatives and they were embarrassed. I defended myself by explaining my reasoning and also saying that I had told them about it but they said they didn't think I was being serious. They say in a healthy family people come to each other's birthdays and what I did put them in a position that they had to explain away my unacceptable behavior to relatives and this is not cool.

They also say this night was about my sister and I was not there to support her and if I had problems with parents I should have tried to solve it with them rather than damaging my sister's night.

Turned out the answer they gave to relatives for my absence was that it was my choice to do a smaller celebration with my friends. It's not technically a lie, but they left out the part which they told me they wouldn't let me have a party which started this whole thing. And I'm grounded for two weeks.

So basically what happened is that after finishing my 12 hour shift I went to a nearby supermarket by the restaurant I work at and when I finished doing my checkout I saw 2 of my coworkers, I am a really shy/social anxiety person so in my head it made sense to just walk pass by them and not say anything, as I myself don't care if people come and say hi to me whenever I am out and about. 
 But when I was about to get through the door, they started yelling hey! at me. So I turn around and walk towards them and as I was about to say hi.

"title: AITA for not having empathy for GMA
content: I (34F) lost my mom (I’m the only child) suddenly almost 7 years ago. I was raised by her as she was a single mom. My family and I were kind of close. Grandmother has always offered her home if you needed to move back home. But the family still had significant distances between us as far as complete trust and communication.

When my mom passed suddenly, I was there. I woke up to find her deceased. We have lived together since I was born. I’ve only moved out briefly when younger. My mother would stay at home, since retiring, and help me with my kids. My daughter was one and Mom was showing signs of sickness. It got to a point to where it was dangerous for my mom to watch my daughter due to her not being able to stay awake. I ended up quitting my job a week before tragedy struck.

My mom is the middle child of my grandparent’s three kids. She always told me of her upbringing and how she always felt left out or emotionally hurt by my grandmother. 

Fast forward to the day after discovering my mom deceased in her bedroom, I’m told by my grandmother to “Put my big girl panties on”. I was horrified at the lack of care in her voice and emotions that she didn’t display. I was 28 years old and never planned a funeral or anything similar to that and it was all put on me and left for me to do.

Weeks after mom’s passing, the kids and I are on the verge of being homeless. Grandmother did not offer for us to move in with her nor really accepted when I asked. For months my kids and I were spilt up and separated. My sons were with my father and my daughter with her dad. I slept in my car, slept on couches and went hungry for months. Doing odd jobs here and there for food and to support my children. Without really hearing from family or being apart of family dinners, holidays or anything. After a year I was finally in a good space to get an apartment and eventually I married and stayed away for a few years. Only communicated every once in a while with a few visits here and there. During these years I have dealt with Major Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have been in therapy as well as seeing a psychiatrist. I have learned my boundaries and to be honest it could possibly have made me less sensitive to certain things and people. 

My family believes that I should not feel like my mom’s passing was the traumatic event that it was for me and I should be more sensitive to my GMA (83) who lost her daughter (61) for Mother’s Day. I know my mom was a sister, daughter and everything else, but I have the rest of my life to live without a mom or dad! They believe I’m selfish because I felt left out, abandoned and disowned by my family and I express to them how traumatized I am for losing the only person I feel ever truly lived me.

"title: AITA for not helping my sibling move after I’ve had surgery?
content: My (20s) sibling (30s) is moving within the next month or so and I very recently had surgery on my arm. Thankfully, I’m in the next stage of my recovery and out of a splint but I still have many restrictions on what I can and cannot do. I just barely started typing this week and absolutely cannot lift anything close to or over 20lbs. 

Anyway, my sibling is now having my mom guilt trip me into helping him move and saying that I could at least show up to hold doors open. The kicker is that my sibling has more than enough people coming to help through the move (over 10 people - they did not hire movers). My mom had said that they’re still my sibling and I’ll need their help one day when I move. The funny thing is that a little over a year ago, my parents kicked me out of the house to where I moved out overnight with trash bags and my sibling outted me to my parents (basically read my personal journal with my honest thoughts and feelings and even sexual feelings out loud to my parents). My sibling and my parents weren’t there for me then and had said they won’t help me move in the future. 

For those reasons, I don’t feel very willing to help them move, especially when I would just be getting in the way or potentially injuring my arm all over again in the process. But as far as recovery goes, I’m concerned I’d be injured even accidentally during the move if I’m “holding doors”. AITA?",nta

"title: AITA for not informing my girlfriend that my food had nuts in it and causing her to have an allergic reaction?
content: So this happened last week and my girlfriend and I haven’t really been getting along at all since and I just wanted an unbiased opinion.

I (26M) have been dating Ella (22F) for two months now. My family is from an Asian background so a majority of the food I cook for just myself include peanuts and other nuts because it’s an important ingredient in my cultural dishes. I live alone, so I just make my own food for myself, but because of Ella’s allergy, I don’t make foods with peanuts in them when I know I’m also cooking for her.

Her allergy is only reactive if she ingests a good amount of the actual nut and is unaffected by smell, airborne, and small traces of cross contamination. Recently, I made a dish which contains a heavy usage of nuts blended into the curry so you can’t see that they’re there and left the leftovers in my fridge. Ella came over while I was in the shower, and during that time she apparently went into my fridge and helped herself to a big portion of the curry and immediately started having an allergic reaction. Luckily she had her epipen and was okay after a few minutes, but she absolutely went off on me and kept accusing me of causing her harm.

I felt extremely guilty that she had a bad allergic reaction from my food and apologized profusely and offered to take her to the hospital, but she was just screaming at me the whole time. She said that if I really cared about her I should have labeled all of my food for her and let her know ahead of time exactly what in the fridge has nuts. I understand that this is extremely scary and important for her health, but the same time she 1) never asked me to label things before 2) went into my fridge and helped herself to my food without even asking me 3) got mad at me for cooking my cultural dishes at all because they have her allergen in them.

I told her that going forward, I’ll try to put a sticky note on the containers that have nuts in the food so this doesn’t happen again, but that she also cannot blame me for her allergic reaction when she ate my food without even asking me if she could or what was in it. AITA?",nta

content: Not an english speaker so forgive me for my mistakes.

One my coworkers is very skilled with crafts, especially knitting. She always showed me the projects she was doing, commented (complained) on the number of commissions she had from friends and family, etc.

One day, out of the blue, she offered to do something to me. I refused at first, it is not the type of garment that I usually wear or would buy for myself, and I told her that the intention was enough and I felt grateful and appreciated.

She insisted until I gave in (I didn't want to seem rude) and I told her that she could make a shawl for my mom.
In the end she said she would make 2. I offered to buy the thread. The thread was tremendously expensive and I just followed her instructions since I don't know anything about it. It cost me the same as my weekly groceries, to give you an idea.

When I told my mom what she was planning to do for us, she was grateful and sent her a present. My coworker felt very grateful and was very moved when I gave her my mother's gift.

She made the first shawl, brought it to me at work (at this time she no longer worked in the same place), I thanked her, complimented her work (as I always did when she showed me her projects) and sent it to my mother.

She told me that mine would take longer, as  Christmas and other festivities were approaching for which she had to knit several orders. I told her not to worry and to do it when it suits her.

She told me she would stop by when I was working to give me my shawl, but she didn't come.
Another day she said to meet but it didn't suit me and I explained why. 
And the last time she said she would stop by my job after hers, but in the end she didn't come. I didn't give it much importance, I assumed that she would be tired.

Suddenly, she texted me a few days ago saying how sad she is, that I show no interest in the gift, that it's not her responsibility to deliver it to me, and that she's going to end up selling it if I don't want it.
I explained to her that it was not a lack of interest. That she always complained about how busy she was and the amount of orders she has to do and that's why I always told her to give me mine when it suits her best. And I reminded her that she's the one who didn't come the last times she said she was comig to give it to me.

We have over 30 kids in our family so it’s just not feasible, but we would include kids if we had an unlimited budget - it has nothing to do with wanting an adult event.

We ARE including my two nieces and nephew - all from the same family and they’re in the wedding party (flower girls and ring bearer) so we saw that as an exception. They will most likely be picked up by a babysitter after dinner/before dancing. We also invited my fiancé’s cousins two kids who are 16 (a junior in high school) and 18 (freshman in college). They are flying 6 hours to get here and we saw them as adults so we included them. We basically would include anyone 16+ who could act as an adult.

My fiancé’s other cousins (on the other side of his family -  not related to the teen cousins) called him super angry today. They had originally assumed that their 4 year old could come. We had to tell them that we weren’t having kids, but they heard through the grapevine about the teens as well as the kids in the wedding and now they’ve decided they won’t come. If it was just one kid, sure, but we have TONS of parents being invited and would then have to include all those children, too.

I feel kind of bad for having a kids wedding but bending the rules. At the same time, I feel like each of these “exceptions” wasn’t truly an exception and was justified. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not inviting a family member's partner to our wedding?
content: Me (26) and my fiancee (24) are finally marrying this year.

After we initially wanted to marry in the smallest group possible (Parents + marriage witnesses)

we overthought our first plans (Because of concerns from the family) but sticked with the idea of having a wedding where we only invite a small group of people.

After finding the right location that fitted our imaginations we selected a location with the limitation that it can only host up to 25 people.

It was the only place that is nearby, affordable and fits our style.

With that number in mind we knew that we couldn't invite everyone and made our plannings.

We left out a good chunk of our friends in order to get all of our closest within those 25 people and we decided to not invite one of the partners of one (M) family member to stay right at 25 people.

The partner of this family member is hated by all others and we don't really have anything to do with that person either and if so it is always in a negative way.

For example she doesn't even greet us when we walk by. (We live in the same street)

But if we didn't had this limit of 25 people, we probably would have invited her anyway just to avoid any conflict within the family.

After we sent out our invitations he declined to come to our wedding because we didn't invite her to it, even given the reasoning that we cannot go over 25 people and we already left out some other people, too. 

Part of my family is now disappointed that we didn't change our whole plans and invited her just to keep everyone happy.

"title: AITA for not inviting my boyfriend’s entire family to my graduation dinner?
content: my boyfriend (21) of 1.5 years has a family of 6: himself, his sister, his mom, and his aunt, uncle, and cousin. i (20) have always been invited to their special gatherings, from birthdays to holidays to a week-long summer vacation and another vacation coming up this year. his cousins are very wealthy and they often order very extravagant/expensive dinners, which i am so grateful to have been invited to and enjoy with them. they treat me like family. i was always shocked by their kindness from the beginning because my family is very small/close-knit (just me, my mom, and my dad) and my parents always frowned upon inviting friends/significant others to our family dinners.

i am graduating this week and my parents are taking me out to dinner. they have met my boyfriend, but not his family. i asked if we could at least invite his mom and sister as well, and they are coming. i wanted to invite his aunt, uncle, and cousin but i am so nervous about the price of the dinner exceeding my parents’ ability to afford it. i am also incredibly nervous about everyone getting along for the first time, and about upsetting my parents by inviting too many people to a family dinner.

i just found out that my boyfriend’s aunt is giving me some sort of graduation gift. i told my boyfriend how bad i felt about not inviting them — truly, i feel absolutely terrible and i want his extended family there — and he said they probably wouldn’t be able to make it anyway. AITA? i have a pit in my stomach right now because of how bad i feel excluding them.",nta
"title: AITA for not inviting my friend to every hangout?
content: Background: Me and this person met while we lived in a different city and quickly grew close due to our circumstances there (new in the city, same life stage, worked from home so didn't have coworker friends, partners being in the same grad program). My partner and I moved back to our hometowns after he graduated and my friend and her partner decided to also move there as well. Not only did they decide to move to the same city but the same apartment complex we live in. I was very hesitant with this idea because I would feel obligated to invite them to every social event that happens since she's so close. I have grown up in this city and lived her all my life (except for the few years I was away while my partner was in school) so, I have many friends & family here that I'm very close to. 

Ever since she moved in, I've tried including her in every way possible. However, after a few months of her being her, I started getting weird vibes from her. I took it as maybe she was having a hard time adjusting so, I sat down with her to see what's up. She then tells me that she felt like our friendship has changed from when we lived in the city where we met like, I would do things that made her feel left out and not include on purpose (like, spontaneous hangouts I would have at my place, not including her in a conversation). Mind you, I have created a life in this city for the past 20+ years and have family and many friends I've made prior to her moving here so, yes, I prioritize those 1x1 hangouts and don't tell her to come to every single social activity I go to because I may not feel comfortable with offering the invite. I have had conversations with her in the past about boundaries and I just feel like she keeps pushing me to loosen those boundaries I'm working so hard to keep. And her saying that makes me feel guilty and obligated to invite her to EVERYTHING isn't helping me want to stay friends with her. AITA??",nta
"title: AITA for not inviting my step mother to my wedding?
content: I(29F) am gonna get married in 2 months and as per the request of my mom I have decided not invite my step mother to my wedding.

A little backstory, my father was never present throughout my childhood. He was a workaholic and had a job which requires a lot of travelling. He was an absent father and husband. He has missed several events of my life including my birthday, recitals etc. Overtime I got tired of it and naturally grew closer to my mom so when they divorced I stayed with my mom.

My dad regretted not being there for us and promised to not do that again but it was too late. A few years later my dad remarried another woman and now lives with her and her two sons who are 20 and 16.  True to his words my dad is a better husband to my step mom than he was to my mom and is very attentive towards my step siblings. This has made my mom very jealous and ngl but I'm a little jealous of them too.

My mom doesn't like my step mom and during a family gathering my mom overheard my step mom praising my dad about how much of a good husband and father he is. My mom being drunk got angry and created a scene and started sh!t talking about her and my dad, things got ugly and step mom also said stuff and was badmouthing about me like how badly I was raised, and how every bad quality I have in me is because of my mom's upbringing  and lets just that I am not very fond of her now. So they are not on speaking terms and my mom also avoids events where my  step mom might be present.

So for my wedding my mom asked me to not invite her I persuaded her a little by saying it wont be nice to do that but she said that if my step mom comes she's not gonna come. So I called my dad and told him that due to their history I would appreciated if my step mom wont come to my wedding ( at least not to the main event but if she wants she can come to the reception) and told him that if she comes then my mom wont come. Obviously my dad is not happy with this. I told him to understand the situation and I would really like both of my parents to be present but he said if my step mom is not invited then he wont come either. Out of frustration I told him ""Fine don't come to my wedding and be absent from it just like you have been absent from my other events my whole life"".

"title: AITA for not inviting my vegetarian friend to my BBQ party?
content: Hey guys, I need some judgment on whether or not I'm an asshole for not inviting my vegetarian friend to my BBQ party. So, I planned this party for this weekend and I invited all of my friends, except for my vegetarian friend, let's call her Jane. 

The reason I didn't invite Jane is because she's a vegetarian, and I'm planning on grilling up some meat for the party. I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or left out, so I just didn't invite her. 

When Jane found out about the party through social media, she was really upset with me and said that I was being inconsiderate of her beliefs. But I think it's ridiculous that I should have to cater to her dietary restrictions, especially since I'm the one hosting the party. 

So, am I the asshole for not inviting my vegetarian friend to my BBQ party? I just don't think it's fair that I should have to change my plans to accommodate her diet.

Thanks for your feedback in advance!

Edit: some people have pointed out that I could just provide vegetarian options for Jane, but I don't think it's my responsibility to do so. And now that I tried to invite her, and I said she could come and bring her own vegan food, she said she doesn't even want to come anymore.",yta

"title: AITA for not leaving money from my inheritance for my children to go to college even though it was my father's wish?
content: I am a single mother of 3 children (18F, 15F and 11M). I don't have good financial conditions, my ex-husband pays a low pension (his salary is actually bad), we don't go hungry, but we don't have luxury. 

3 years ago, my father passed away and I received my share of the inheritance. One of my father's biggest wishes is for us to buy a house, pay off our debts and even help with the grandchildren's college. 

Tbh this money was totally used to pay off the house and pay my debts, what was left I made a big shopping (groceries( and paid the house bills, so I didn't reserve for my children. It was a difficult decision, but we went from being in debt to living paycheck to paycheck. Not ideal, but much better. 

Since they were young, I told my children that if they wanted to go to college, I couldn't help them if they decided to go to college outside the city and that they would have to work for it, but if they stayed in the city, they wouldn't need it so much because they would live at home . 

My oldest daughter got in  a great college and is looking for jobs in the city, as well as cheap housing and government subsidies for living expenses. She will start in August. 

An important context: My brother is doing well financially, we don't get along so well for random reasons, but our kids are friends. He has a son the same age as mine.

I think in one of her conversations about college with her cousin she found out that he had a college fund left with grandfather's inheritance.

 I never mentioned to my children that it was my father's desire to help his grandchildren, as it was up to us whether we did that or not. 

My daughter, when she found out, said that I could have saved money for the children and they wouldn't have difficulty in college, in addition to needing government help. Or having planned myself financially better. But that it was selfish to have ignored a grandfather's desire to pay for my things, unlike my brother who prioritized his son 

This hurt me a lot, as it was a necessary decision. But I told her that I did what was necessary to keep food on the table and she needs to get better at our situation instead of coming to complain to me about decisions that are solely mine and not hers about this money. 

We are not on good terms, she still thinks I made a selfish decision. 

AITA? 

TL;DR: I received an inheritance from my deceased father and one of his wishes was to help his grandchildren in college (optional) and I decided to use it to pay for the house and debts. My daughter found out about her grandfather's wish and now she's calling me selfish

Extra:
The debts are credit card expenses because I was unemployed at that time and I used up my cards for months to have food at home and pay the mortgage so we wouldn't be homeless. And the big groceries purchase was because we needed it after months of having the bare minimum at home. But 90% went to pay the house.

 These wishes of my father's were never written in will, only what the division would be. But he always told his children how he would like we spent (he was already in poor health)",nta
"title: AITA for not lending money to my friend who lost their job due to being fired for misconduct?
content: Hi Reddit, I need some advice on a situation with my friend. My friend, let's call him Tom, recently lost his job due to being fired for misconduct. He didn't disclose the exact details, but from what I gathered, he was caught violating company policies and was let go as a result.

Tom has been reaching out to me for help as he's struggling financially since losing his job. He's asked me if I could lend him some money to help him get by until he finds a new job.

I'm conflicted because while I sympathize with him losing his job, I'm uncomfortable lending money to someone who was fired for misconduct. It makes me question whether he's reliable and trustworthy enough to pay me back. Plus, I don't want to enable any negative behavior if his misconduct was related to something like substance abuse or gambling.

I haven't outright told Tom no, but I've been hesitant in my responses to him. He's been getting increasingly frustrated with me and has accused me of being unsupportive and not caring about his situation.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to lend Tom money due to his misconduct? Should I be more understanding and offer to help him out despite my reservations? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",nta
"title: AITA for not lending my sister my phone charger?
content: my (20 f ) sister ( 17 f ) has an upcoming trip to NYC where she will be leaving for four days. she started packing and came into my room and asked me if i would give her my phone charger for the trip and she would lend me another one while she was away, which is actually larger than mine.  The issue is, whenever a charger went missing / broke / stopped working in our house, the fault was blamed on me. Even if i hadn’t used that charger, i was blamed for it and often had to buy a new one out of my money. It came to a point where the charger with the pink dot was the only one I was allowed to use. If we were in the car and my phone died , or on a trip and I didn’t have that charger, though luck I either had to buy a new one or wait till’ we got home to charge my phone, neither my mom or my sister would lend me theirs. This is why when she asked to borrow mine, I told her no. Keep in mind, she could take the long, charger she was going to lend me, but instead it turned into a screaming match of why i was a selfish . My mom got involved and also started saying I only care about whats best for me and that i am an awful sister, but I still didn’t give her the charger. Total honestly, I’m hiding it rn cause im scared she will take if i leave it in its usual place. I don’t plan on giving her the charger, even less after the way she reacted after the initial ‘no’, but what she and my mom said are getting into my head.

"title: AITA for not letting my MIL spend Mother’s Day with BIL and SIL
content: AITA for not letting MIL spend Mother’s Day with BIL and SIL

Me 40F and my husband 50M have two children (3 yo and 3 month old). My husband’s mother lives with us and we help care for her. She has mobility issues and doesn’t drive.  My FIL passed away shortly before my husband and I got married and she’s been living with us ever since.  

My BIL and SIL have been married since they were very young and my BIL has been close with my SIL’s family ever since. He hasn’t had the best relationship with my MIL, but they do rely on her periodically for financial reasons.  (Which is fine, it’s her money, if she wants to help them out, more power to her.) 

Additionally, my FIL’s birthday was always close to Mother’s Day and last year, his birthday fell on Mother’s Day. Because of this, we had the day be about her. 

My BIL and SIL called to say Happy Mother’s Day, but that was the extent of it. Also, they don’t typically include us in any holiday celebrations. 

A couple of weeks ago, my BIL and SIL invited my MIL to visit for an overnight stay (they live about 90 minutes away), which was fine, but my husband had to drive her out to them, which they didn’t ask him to do, they just told him they needed him to do. We had plans that day, so having 3 hours to drive her somewhere was difficult, but we made it work. 

That being said, for Mother’s Day this year, my husband wanted to take me out and planned a whole day for us to make up for the previous year. My husband set up childcare that partially involved my MIL. My dad is going to watch the kids for part of the day but he has to bring my mom, who has mid/late stage dementia. She really likes my MIL, so having her there will help my dad tremendously.

Last night, my BIL and SIL asked MIL to have an overnight visit on Mother’s Day weekend, leaving us for half a day without anyone to watch the kids. When we told them we had plans already and that Mother’s Day weekend, they said we were being selfish for leaving MIL alone and told us we ruined all of their plans. 

We said it was unfair to plan something with MIL without talking with us, too, since she lives with us and because we would need us to drive her at least one way. 

I understand wanting to do something nice for her for Mother’s Day, but we made plans well in advance for the day and didn’t consult them because in the last 12 years, they’ve never made plans that involve MIL.

My husband believes they are amping up to ask for money and that’s why there is urgency to have her over. I don’t really care why they want to visit with her, I just think they shouldn’t expect us to change our plans or bend over backwards to accommodate them when they feel like seeing her. 

So, Am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my cousin experience motherhood?
content: I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.

They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.

I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.

It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.

I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.

I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.

I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA

EDIT/UPDATE:

Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my daughter miss out on stuff just because her step-sister doesn’t get to go?
content: **I meant to put half sister in the title, not step sister
 

My husband has a daughter from a previous relationship, “Maddie” (15F). Before I even met my husband, Maddie’s mother moved abroad. Maddie decided to go with her. My husband and I been married for 10 years and we have a 8 year old daughter “Abby”. Maddie visits us for the whole summer and 2 weeks in the winter. We go to her when Abby is on spring break. 

We obviously save big family trips for when Maddie is with us. Same with any other “once in a lifetime” events. However, my husband is consistently reluctant to do pretty much anything without Maddie. I tried to be patient, but it feels like we can’t do anything throughout the year until she gets there. 

An example, we live near a water park. We have season passes and take Maddie all throughout the summer. But my husband refuses to go until Maddie comes to stay with us. And he doesn’t want Abby to go as it’s unfair. I’ve tried discussing this with him but he won’t budge. Sometimes I win him over but then he complains the entire time that Maddie isn’t there. 

Abby loves Taylor Swift, who was going to be in the area for a limited time and before Maddie would arrive. My mom somehow scored us tickets and Abby was so excited. My husband said it wasn’t fair because Maddie also loves Taylor Swift and she doesn’t get to go. I said I’d take both girls to another concert during the summer, as there’s going to be a few other artists that I know Maddie likes in the area. My husband said it still isn’t fair and tried to ban Abby from going. (Because I know it will be asked, it’s not possible for Maddie to fly out for the concert. She still has school and important exams that can’t be missed.)

I put my foot down and said that life isn’t always going to be fair. Maddie lives in another country. She is going to miss out on things. It’s not fair to ask Abby to give up fun opportunities because Maddie can’t come. I pointed out that Maddie gets to do fun things with her mom and Abby isn’t there (which I think is completely fair). My husband said that’s different, because his ex isn’t Abby’s mom, but he’s Maddie’s dad.

Eventually, he could see I wasn’t going to give up and said yes to the concert. My mom, Abby and I attended and we had a great time. It was Abby’s first concert and she loved it. 

My husband says I bullied him into this and that if Maddie didn’t get to go, Abby shouldn’t. Maddie is disappointed she didn’t get to go but seems happy for her sister.

"title: AITA for not letting my ex move in
content: A little back story, my ex and I where together for 6 years. We have a little girl together and she has full custody of her son. Among many reasons for me leaving her, my main reasons where that it's always her way or nothing, there's always an excuse to not do something she doesn't want to do, and also the fact that things where perfect between us untill my daughter was born. After which I was cast aside and basicly only worth what I could provide. 

Also important, I have always had a job making good money, but it takes me across the country for 4-6 months every year. This wasn't ever an issue because then she could take a leave of absence from her job and sit at home with the kids. Which would b fine if things actually got done around the house, but there's always an excuse and it was typically that the kids where such hard work. Often I would come home and basic house work was neglected, much less big projects like going thru the pile of boxes of 'her things' left from the move 2 yrs prior that I wasn't allowed to touch because she needed to sort thru it but never had time. 

After the separation, it was my fault she had nowhere to go because I left her, though I continued to pay rent and bills while she lived there and I lived elsewhere because my daughter was in her care. she moved out of our house left her in, to live with her brother. Still working a job that only schedules her 2 days a week and refuses to give her more hours for some reason, giving her no way to find her own place. I've suggested she find a new job here or there but there's always some escuse why it wouldn't work. I mentioned I will pay full price for daycare but again with the excuses. 

Now that I am half way across the country and she tells me that her brother has to move, leaving her without a place to stay. She hasn't asked yet, but I've already basicly told her she's not staying at my house which is currently empty. We have been separated for almost a year and a half and she still mentions in arguments that it's my fault that she is in the position shes in. She says I'm a horrible father for letting her and my daughter struggle the way they do, but I'm always there for my daughter with anything she could need or want. And when I am home I am always available and want to b with my daughter but am under some restriction by my ex because 'the kids should be with their mom' (her way or nothing)

Secretly I'm hoping she gets to a point where she can't hold a roof for my daughter and I can file for custody. This job would more than allow for me to bring my daughter with me every year, giving her the experience of adventure and a change in lifestyle that I feel would be great for growth. 

So my question, am I the asshole for not letting my deadbeat, controlling, manipulative ex back into my house with my daughter and her son because she refuses to do better for herself even though she has plenty of time and opportunities to do so.",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my girlfriend wear her “unique” dress to a wedding?
content: UPDATED! 

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all!

Grandmother has many complex illnesses, is not in great shape, almost died 4 months ago and had four emergency surgeries since. She has a cocktail list of medications and infusions that she has to take daily. All of her doctors and specialists are in the state that she lives in. I told my mother when my grandfather got ill to move them to us (I was not moving as my school, job, husbands job, and husbands family all live where we are) so that we could help and be a part of her care team. They both (M&GM) said no because they don’t like where I live. My mother asked me if I could keep my grandmother while she goes on an 8 day cruise. I said no: we do not have a spare room (only a couch) and that would not be appropriate for her to sleep on for 8 days, my husband and I will be at work (driving time included) from 7am to 6/6:30pm M-F (hubby also on Saturday) and I don’t feel comfortable with her being left alone with no one to help in case of an emergency/help her with her medications and infusions, and in case of an emergency all of her doctors/specialists are in another state 8 hours away.

i (17f) have 3 younger cousins that i am close with and see quite frequently. the other week they came over with my aunt and uncle to have dinner with us. we were all sat in the living room and at first i was drawing with my 2 youngest cousins on the floor. eventually they got bored of drawing and wanted to play legos with my nana. so while they didn't want my attention i thought i'd play on my switch. the game in question is corpse party, and for those of you that don't know, it's a pretty gory and graphic game (if you couldn't guess by the title haha).

after around 30 minutes of legos the youngest wanted to play with her teddies, but my other cousin (8m) didn't want to and came and sat next to me. as soon as he did that i turned my switch off and asked him if he wanted to play or anything. he said he wanted to watch me play what i had been playing. i explained that he couldn't watch me play that game, as it was for adults not children and it was very scary so he wouldn't like it. he insisted that he wanted to watch me play it, and i once again said no but if he wanted to play on the switch he could watch me play another game or we could play a game together on it like mario kart or something (i know he likes those games as he has a switch himself and plays them). he started whining and demanding i let him watch me play. my mom overheard and asked me why i wouldn't let him watch. i told her what i told him. she then got mad at me and told me i shouldn't be playing games like that around children. i said the kids weren't near me when i was playing it, i didn't have the volume on, and i turned it off the moment i saw him walking towards me so he saw nothing.

my mom was still mad and told the rest of my family and they all started berating me saying i did that on purpose to ""wind him up"" when i should've known he would've wanted to watch me play. i got annoyed at that point and asked my aunt if she wanted me to show her 8 year old son a video game that has people being brutally murdered in it. that made everyone even more mad and they ended up leaving early, before dinner, which really angered my mom because there was a bunch of food left over.

i feel really bad because i haven't seen my cousins since and i feel like i shouldn'tve been playing that game with other people around, even though no one could see what i was playing. but at the same time i feel like it's not my fault he asked to watch, and then couldn't understand why i said no, but then again he is just a kid. can people please let me know if i need to apologize or not",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my miracle baby niece be my flower girl at my wedding?
content: My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. 

Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. 

Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.

Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. 

So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.

She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.

She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should ""honor her"" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. 

Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said 

""Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?""

She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm ""letting her down"". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. 

Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.

I'm firm in my decision though, and my fiancé is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my mom or MIL at my house because of their animals?
content: My son has asthma and we are still learning his breathing triggers. But even without his asthma being a factor, I don't want animals at my house. We don't have pets outside of my son's 3 goldfish. I won't say I dislike animals, because I actually do like animals. But I hate shitty pet owners and can't tolerate being around them if I'm being honest. 

So my MIL has a MASSIVE 1 year old Mastiff/Rottie mix. Beautiful dog. She hasn't attempted to train him. I don't even like going to my MILs house because the second you walk on to the property this dog is jumping up on you and knocking you on your ass. His paws alone are damn near close to the size of my head. She has shown up here twice with her dog, without even telling us and I absolutely cannot deal with it. The dog never stops barking or playing and the chaos fucks with my head to a point of me being pissed and feeling trapped. 

Then there's my mom.. my mom is a farm girl. She has a whole slew of farm critters. Dogs, cats, goats, chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs and geese. Her business is basically breeding and growing meat goats. So, every year she has about 16+ baby goats that she has to bottle feed every 2-6 hours (depending on their size and age). Generally speaking, she ALWAYS has a goat with her. They are small and super cute but I don't want a flipping goat at my house when she comes to visit. She doesn't try to bring the goats inside or anything like that but she does let them roam around my yard and shit everywhere and chew on things and I'm so over it. 

So basically, when my son was diagnosed with asthma, I told both my MIL and my mom they couldn't bring the animals here anymore due to my kids asthma. I've told them they couldn't before the diagnosis but ultimately they didn't listen at all. But now that my son has this diagnosis, if they are to show up here with the animals they will be cut completely from our lives. My mother was fine with it but my MIL is pissed, saying her dog isn't the reason he has asthma and I'm just a dog hater and terrible person. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my nephew use my car for prom, but said I might let his sister use it?
content:   

I (32m) have a nephew Josh (18m) and a niece Sarah (16F), and this argument came up when visiting my sister. 

My car is a very modified classic car, A 72 challenger with a modern motor swap, 6 speed manual, and more mods putting out over 1000 hp. It is not a beginner driver friendly car.

Josh didn’t get his license until 3 months ago, and I am pretty sure he fubbed numbers to take the test for the 3rd time. I have seen him drive once, and even offered to ride with him before to help pump his hours up and to continue to drive so he can feel more comfortable. Sarah goes to car shows with me and has a modified Miata that she drives everywhere. She got her license 2 weeks after turning 16 and has had it for 8 months now. She drove with me every day after getting her permit, and just has that drive to drive. 

Before anyone says I have my favorite, Josh and I game EVERY night, and I built him a custom PC for getting honor role. He is AMAZING at tech, loves gaming, and if he decides to continue, I will be paying for his college and will offer him a job at my business which offers specialized tech services. I have told both of them the dollar amounts I have saved up that will be for them for the future. If they want to use it for school, training, down payment on a house, travel, it will be theirs as long as they can tell me they have a plan. 

I bought both of them their first cars after they got their licenses and try to keep everything as close to fair as I can with them.

 I was over for dinner and Josh said he can’t wait for prom and was asking if he could use my car to drive his date. I told him I was not comfortable with him driving my car, and that I would gladly drive him and his date, and even wear a suit and funny hat to be his driver. He threw a fit and said that I would let Sarah take the car if she asked. I said if she kept driving and showing the control she has, I would consider it. I told him I feel he has not been driving long enough to be able to control this car, and that I would be worried for his and his dates safety. I also told him I would trust him with my PC before I’d even let Sarah play the sims on it and it’s just how they are different people with different interests. My sister said I should have just said no, but I have always told them I will never lie to them and explain myself why because they are almost adults and deserve to hear the truth. (I won’t be rude to them however). 

He has since not played games with me, and not responded to my texts. His father says I am TAH, My sister said I should have just said no but now should just let him use the car, Sarah says she would be scared to drive the car, our parents said I should have just said no. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my niece host her wedding at my ""castle""?
content: 28 years ago my wife and I combined our savings (most of which came from inheritance after my father's passing) and bought our ""castle"" in southern Europe. It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.

It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.

Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. 

Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.

I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".

My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. 

I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous. 

ETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused",info
"title: AITA for not letting my roommate wear something she stole from me?
content: Last night my roommate was about to leave for some fancy dinner she was attending at her boyfriend’s parent’s house and I noticed she was wearing my dress. I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn’t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don’t have that kind of relationship, we’re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I’m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?
content: I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. 

Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. 

I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.

I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.

Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.

So, AITA?

Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them.",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my step-dad attend my HS graduation?
content: I'm(17m) graduating in a little under a month and we can only bring 4 people to the event. Now, my picks are obvious: my sister(20), my dad(48), my brother(9) we kinda have to bring because my dad has him the weekend of, we cant leave him home alone. (he has a different mom, who also divorced my dad) and last but not least, my mom(45). 

The problem is that my step-dad(who we'll call sp) will forbid my mom from attending if he isn't there, and she will obey, she missed my sister's graduation because sp said that he felt uncomfortable being in the same room as my dad so I have no reason to believe otherwise. This was 2 1/2 months after they met.

The latest example of sp being sp was the last time I stayed at my moms house (I live with my dad), sp didnt like me being there so he sent my mom inside crying, trying to figure out what to do while he waited in the car, then they left without a word and refused to answer the phone. It was just me and my sister left, who was insanely pissed, packed my stuff and we left. Sp only called her once to call us retarded. He all but chased me out. I haven't gone back since.

I've told them that if my sister or dad can't come because sp needs to be there, I just won't attend altogether and have my diploma mailed. It hurts that my mom can't come, but why should I have to choose between my dad or sister and sp? When did he become a contender? Should I let him take one of their place?",nta

Yesterday my brother and his family were visiting me and my niece was looking at the new dresses that I got. She loved one of them and asked if she could borrow it for a party they were going to. I said yes. Her stepsister was looking at the dresses as well. She asked if she could borrow one that she liked.

"title: AITA for not letting my stepsister hang out with me and my friends?
content: So, I (15f) mostly live with my dad and stepmom but I see my bio mom every other weekend. Both sides have a lot of kids, my dad and stepmom have 4 and my bio mom and her husband have 5 more. The difference is, at my dad's and stepmom's house we all have our own rooms and they can still afford to do stuff for us. My bio mom and stepdad live in a tiny 3 bedroom apartment and I share a room with 3 other girls, my stepsister (15) and my half sisters (3 and 5). We can't go out on her weekends because she doesn't want to leave my stepdad with all 5 kids or ""do you know how expensive it is to take 8 people out"", everyone fights over the tv, and there's absolutely no space or privacy. 

I go to a private school by my dad's house, 45 minutes away from my bio mom's house. My bio mom was upset that my stepsister and I aren't close (she goes through and takes my stuff and cries and acts like she's the victim when I tell my bio mom) so she applied for her to go to my school. She got in and they got financial aid so now we go to the same (very small) school and it's impossible to avoid her. 

The problem is nobody else likes her so my bio mom keeps pushing for her to join me and my friends. I keep telling her to go away but she keeps following us. We changed where we eat 3 times because she doesn't leave us alone. I'm also in the plays at school. When the lunch thing wasn't working she made my stepsister audition for the musical and when she didn't get in, she signed her up for crew so we could be closer. I've told both of them to stop, I don't like her and never will and I just want her to leave me alone. 

My bio mom is saying I'm heartless for wanting my stepsister to eat alone instead of letting her hang out with me and my friends and for what I said to her. My dad agrees that they're stupid and annoying but he said I was mean to her and should at least apologize for the ""i don't like you and never will"" thing. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting the kids visit my ex-husband in the hospital?
content: Me(44F) and my ex-husband(48M) have three kids(16M,14M,11M). 6 years ago, my ex-husband had a psychotic episode in the car that almost ended in a fatal accident for all of us and since that, he is in a mental hospital. Before that, we were having a hard time with his mental health issues because he basically lost his sanity after his older brother(46M at that time) passed away suddenly due to a stroke when our youngest was 7 months old but this was a whole new level. 

He couldn't control his emotive responses since then and we never left him alone by himself or with the kids but the societal guilt of being a divorcée always had a big toll on me and I didn't want to lose my ILs so I stayed in the marriage. After this accident happened, my ex-husband was held on a psychiatric hold for the 4th time in the 5 years and the doctors in the hospital said it would be better if he is transferred to a permanent unit. We accepted, our marriage got annulled, I had the sole custody of the kids and all of his assets have been passed on to me as a child support. His family also wanted this.

I still have a good relationship with my exIL's but we have moved to a different city so we don't see them as much as we used to(twice or thrice a year). When we go to their house, I sometimes go see my ex husband but he is not himself most of the time. He is diagnosed with DID and he has more than 12 different personalities. My oldest knows his dads condition and he visited his dad once but the other two doesn't remember that much. 

We were with at exIL's place last month and at the 2nd day, my MIL tried to take them out. It wasn't surprising for me to see them going somewhere with their grandma but I still asked where they were going. I was waiting for ""To the mall"" or ""To a movie"" etc. but she said ""Oh, we are going to ""Hospital's Name."" to visit ""exHusband""."" I turned white really fast and FIL had to hold me. He looked at my MIL and asked kids to get inside. We had a big fight and after that we turned back to our house with FIL beside us. Now, everyone is blaming me for holding back the truth and MIL has contested divorce with FIL and all of their family is supporting her(even FILs sisters and brothers). AITA?",info
"title: AITA for not liking my stepmother?
content: My dad (52m) was married to my step mom (54f) for around 3 year and together for 6 year when they divorced back in 2015. She was awful to me and my older brother, forced our family to move house since ours was too small and then complained when the house we moved in was also too small. Reason being was because every house she and my dad looked at she didn’t like. She got pregnant with my half sister back in 2011 and ever since she was born, it was as if me and my older brother never existed. I was always blamed for stuff that she did, my dad forced me to let her be in my room 24/7 and she made my life hell. I hated that family but none of my other relatives would ever listen to me because to them she’s their princess. Fast forward 5 years when my dad and his wife divorce and she took everything we had. We were lucky that we weren’t on the streets when she left and for the first time in my life, I felt that I was finally able to have a conversation with my dad. I told him how I felt and he broke down and told me how sorry he was but I couldn’t forgive him yet because it would time and he understood that.

Fast forward 7 year and I come home from uni and see my ex step mother in my dads couch eating. I just gave her a disgusted look and went to my room.  She’s been coming round every night for the past 7 months and I’ve just found out they are getting back together. I don’t know what came over me but I lost it and started yelling at them and could my step mum a bitch but I regret that now. I told them both how I felt and that i can’t stand her because of what she did in the past and I told them that. Got called an asshole and went back to my room to calm down.

I (24F) currently live with my roommate A (27M). He has a friend who we will call L (?F).

L has two black labs, she is currently going on a trip for a few days and cannot afford a dog boarder. 

A has volunteered to dogsit for the time she is away. A did not ask me about this and did not consult me when making this decision. After he told me, I said it was fine but that he would be the one looking after them, not me. A has also asked his mother to help. 

A went to pick up L and her dogs this morning. She turned up and asked A to accompany her to the station. A's mother is currently at a doctors appointment and won't be back for a few hours. L and A were originally going to wait for A's mother to get back and then leave. But now, it is forecasted to rain and L does not have a coat so she wants to go now. If they do that, I will be alone with the dogs

I like dogs but I do not believe I am responsible or capable enough to look after both of them. They are very energetic and I would not be comfortable looking after them for a few hours until A's mother gets back. 

Both A and L have asked me to watch the dogs. I said no. But they kept asking. A said ""You'll just have to sit there and watch TV"". I'm tired, I did not get enough sleep last night so when he kept asking, I kinda snapped a bit and in a rather stern voice, I said ""A, what did I just say?!""

They are both now annoyed at me and I'm rather annoyed at them for not looking after the dogs.

"title: AITA for not looking away when someone told me to?
content: So I was at a dance on friday (3 days ago). It was a school dance, and my friends and I having fun and whatever, sitting against a wall. We were eating pizza and joking around about a few pictures we took, when suddenly a group of other students crowds in front of us (forming kinda like a circle). And we were like, ""what are they doing here?"" so one of my friends (i'll call her Soda) walks up to them with me just curious as to what was happening. Some of my other friends were in on it, following around the crowd of about 10(?) people. So I try to figure out why they're over by our spot, being curious and all. 

I ask one of my friends that are in it what was going on and apparently one of my friends (the one in the center of the circle that was formed), we'll call her Ellie, brought her boyfriend in from another school and was now trying to sneak him out. There was an argument I couldn't catch and still don't understand why they were, so I thought I'd stay close to them since the crowd seemed fine with my other friends being near. But then suddenly one of the girls in the group tells us to leave in a very bitchy way. So Soda snaps back and tells her that we were here first, and the girl responds with ""yeah, over THERE,"" pointing to the wall we were at. She shoos us and Soda shouts at her something I can't say. 

A few minutes later Ellie and her boyfriend, the ones escaping, so as instinct I look at them leave and the girl being rude (i'm going to call her Jess) yells at us to not look because we are drawing attention to her. I thought that would've been a good explanation if there wasn't just a whole bunch of people staring down the hallway Ellie were escaping through. Even one of my friends yelled at me for looking in their direction. 

Personally I'm not so sure if they were being reasonable but I'm not sure. Let me know if I was (or not, you don't have to)!",nta
"title: AITA for not losing weight?
content: I (F19) just moved back home for the summer from college. during the school year I started going to the gym and lifting weights and eating healthier. I've been overweight my whole life, but this past year I've become a lot more muscular and strong, and my stamina and endurance have gone up considerably. I've become a bit leaner, but I've been told I look ""built,"" or ""stacked,"" and my musculature is noticeable even though I still have a chubby face and what not. I'm overweight in the same way a rugby player is technically overweight, but they're still athletic and healthy. 

 I was excited to go home and keep working out and maybe even starting shedding more fat because the gym near me has a free summer program for students, but my mother quickly banned me from going because she didn't like that I have muscles since it's not lady like. She is also complaining that I'm overweight and has been doing many uncomfortable things such as making me weigh in every morning, comparing me to my slimmer friends, demanding to know if I have a secret junk food stash in my room (I don't), saying that I look pretty but she can't wait for me to be skinny so we can go buy me some nice clothes and make me look even prettier, and telling me that I'll never get a husband (don't want one) if I have muscles and someone will mistake me for a trans person (she's also transphobic :( ) and etc etc. It's been overall making me feel like shit because I thought I was making decent progress and I finally felt a bit more appreciative of my body for the first time since I hit puberty. It's a bit more backhanded too since I had a bad injury for most of the year that impeded a lot of progress which is still flaring up but I push through in order to stay active, which she ignores and says that it shouldn't matter (I couldn't walk for a few months... hard to lose weight when you're bed bound in a cast.) The past few weeks, I've been acting petty by purposefully taking big helpings at dinner, eating more, and reversing her comments on my body back to her because she's also overweight. She's been getting mad about this more and more and says I'm trying to die young. I tell her that I would love to eat healthy and exercise if she'd stop acting like I was a freak of nature for being a girl with muscles. Am i the asshole for not trying to lose weight anymore so my mom doesn't feel vindicated in her weird comments?",nta
"title: AITA for not meeting my wife’s family?
content: Burner account since some of my friends are Reddit users. 

I (36M) got married to my wife (30F) a few years ago at a Justice of the peace. She’s a foreign national from Montenegro. She was completing her masters here when we met. I’m a US citizen from New York. We were going to travel to her home country later that in the winter for me to meet them. Then Covid happened. Fast forward three years and I finally have the money and time off to travel. Book all of the flights and hotels. Planned it all out to spend five weeks traveling. Start in her country, Montenegro, then Greece, Albania, Croatia and fly back to Montenegro for another few days. Then fly home. All of the stars are aligning. 

A few weeks prior to us traveling she says she wants a break. It’s not that she doesn’t love me, she wants to figure out who she is as a person. She doesn’t want to sleep with anyone. I’ve made life to comfortable for her. She’s had issues finding a job in her field. She wants to figure her shit out. I respond with something along the lines of, “ok i guess. I don’t know if I should meet your parents if we might be divorcing.” I didn’t want to add any emotional baggage to something that was a 50/50 shot of ending. She agreed to that. She asked if she should still go on the trip. I said yes of course. 

Fast forward a few weeks and we’re here. I ask her the morning I’m supposed to meet them if her stance has changed on her needing to figure things out. She said no. I told her it’s probably best I don’t meet her parents then. She was very hurt and offended. She had talked to them saying I was looking forward to finally meeting them, I really was. Now she is going to have to make up an excuse for why I can’t meet them. She was very very hurt. I hadn’t seen her more hurt than that moment. I understand being hurt, but we discussed it before the trip. 

So, am I the asshole in this scenario? I might be and I’ll accept that. Should I have reminded her a few days prior to our agreement. In hindsight, yes. Should I have kept my mouth shut and met them? Probably. I feel terrible because I think I might have put the nail in the coffin with my marriage by not meeting them.

"title: AITA for not moving out of my apartment so my brother can have it?
content: I (F23) have an older brother (32). I moved out of my parent's house earlier than him and found a small place for myself that is really close to my job. The place is not the biggest, it's a one bed room apartment - but it is enough for one person and rent is very cheap so I'm extremely happy with it. I put a lot of work into it and made sure it's my little happy space. 

Recently my brother started staying over now and then, I don't have a problem with that, he works the nightshift and my place is also closer to his job than my parent's house. The problem began when he started brining more and more of his stuff to my place. He brought his PS4, started gaming in my living room and is overall just being a terribly inconsiderate guest and treats me like our mom. 

I brought this up with my parents and my dad suggested that I should let my brother live there and get myself a new apartment, he said I should look for a bigger place because my brother makes less money and he could afford my place and I could find something better. 
But I don't want a bigger apartment. I have no plans to have a family or partner where I would need anything more than one bed room. And I put so much work in to personalizing my apartment that this feels so unfair. 
My parents said I'd be an asshole for both, kicking my brother out now for staying over and not giving him the place. Is that true?

Edit with some additional info: My brother does not pay rent to me, he used to stay here for only a couple of days but it's been turning into weeks.

Edit 2: I did contact my landlord as of today, she hasn't responded yet but she's nice so I hope she'll understand my situation. Also, additional info - I didn't know my parents or my dad would react like this. I thought he'd help me talk to him, we don't have a bad relationship. I am trying to figure out why he thinks my brother should have my apartment too, but my dad hasn't been responsive since that conversation.",nta
"title: AITA for not offering gas and parking money?
content: My friend Alexa invited me to an event last night. I Ubered to the event and met up with Alexa, plus two of her friends that I had never met before. 

Alexa’s friend Bryn drove the rest of the group and I met up with them there. After the event, I was offered a ride home since I live less than two blocks from Alexa so it wasn’t out of the way. 

Today Alexa called me and said that Bryn was offended that I didn’t offer to send her money for parking or gas. Honestly, I didn’t think about parking because I arrived separately and I have no idea what she even paid for it. The venue was only about a ten minute drive and they were already driving past my place, so contributing to gas didn’t cross my mind either. 

I sent Bryn $10 to cover my part of the costs, but the whole thing feels petty. So, AITA for not offering to send her gas and parking money originally?",nta
"title: AITA for not offering to take in my fiancé’s family dog?
content: My fiancé’s mom has a habit of getting pets that she doesn’t have time or money for, and then giving them away.

A few years ago, she got a puppy who’s quite hyper, and she never got him neutered. She also didn’t potty train him.

My fiancé moved back in with his family and had been taking care of the new dog, and took him for walks, and potty trained him.

However, my fiancé and I are getting a condo so he will be moving out. Because my fiancé is the only one taking care of the dog, his mom and sister decided to sell the dog to my fiancé’s absentee dad who never sees him and never lets him visit.

My fiancé had hinted to me about adopting the dog, but I wasn’t open to it because things have been very stressful between us lately. We have a lot of big life changes, and having a dog that’s hyper and destructive would be difficult. We’ll also be in a HOA with strict rules about dogs.


His dad took the dog very coldly in a rush, and my fiancé is very upset. I feel guilty though like I should have said “let’s adopt the dog.” AITA for not offering that option?",nta
"title: AITA for not paying everyone’s dinner during my wife’s birthday?
content: Hi all,
Just wanted to let you in on something whether I am the one to blame here or that I shouldn’t feel myself guilty. 

Situation:
My wife’s birthday was coming up so we usually go out for dinner to celebrate it. Sometimes her parents also come and its fine, I pay the bill as I organize it so not a big deal. This year my wife asked me whether her parents and her sister could also join. I agreed and said I will pay for their food and drinks as I am the one organizing it. But then literally the night before my SIL let me know that my BIL and his wife would also join. I said sure but  felt a little bit irritated that they didn’t consult with me first but then again did not want to ruin the day so said ok. 

So during dinner I paid for everyone’s food and for everyone’s drinks. Also a small part of my BIL and his wife food. But did not propose during the day to also pay for them food as it would be to high for me. My FIL looked to me a little bit weird when I did not propose to pay for my BIL and his wife’s food part (I had the rest of the bill already paid beforehand). He did not even thank me for that I paid for his food. Moreover afterwards my wife said to me why I did not paid his brother’s food and his wife’s. And that they sure would pay back afterwards. I said that nobody consulted with me beforehand that more attendees were coming and therefore they shouldn’t assume that I pay for everyone’s food of extra people coming. She did not even thank me and also said she did not want my gift for her birthday. As I became angry I said fine and also took her gift back. 

AITA here for also not proposing to pay my BIL and his wife’s food bill? I felt sad that they assumed I should also pay for their food even without consulting with me first. They are welcome to come but not assuming I should pay also for their food. 

Summary:
Husband organized wife’s birthday, paid for their food and drinks and also for their wife’s family. BIL and his wife also came to dinner but husband did not propose to pay also their dinner. Their drinks were already paid beforehand. Afterwards FIL did not thank him and looked weird and wife also said why husband did not pay for her brother’s food and wife of brother.

Update: Since some of you guys asking about how much it extra would be: the gift and food and drinks for 5 people was over 300 dollars. With 2 extra people it would be almost 400 dollars and too much for me. I paid small part of their food and had already paid for their drinks.",yta
"title: AITA for not paying for my daughter's wedding because she invited my brother and his family
content: I'm 46M, my brother 48M.

When I was 20, my then girlfriend cheated with my brother. I was heartbroken and pissed. I told him he is no longer my brother. Despite my request, my family didnt cut him off, so I told them that I will never again be in the same place as he is. If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.

My daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.

I was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.

My ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected. Am I asshole for that?",info
"title: AITA for not paying for my share of an AirBnB rental?
content: One of my friends is getting married in a few weeks. Last weekend she had her bachelorette party. The majority of the planning was done by her two older sisters, who ended up booking a pretty expensive AirBnB in a popular vacation/party city on the east coast (the majority of the bridal party is mostly west coast-based). 

They booked this AirBnB before any of us had a chance to discuss budgeting, basically just expecting us to pay for it no matter what. This obviously irked me, as originally our party had agreed to paying a maximum of $250 for the Airbnb, but I decided to stay quiet for the sake of the bride and not make a big fuss about it.

The day came when it was finally time for us all to fly out. I was supposed to be flying on a spirit flight with the bride-to-be. Our flight was delayed at first, but was eventually cancelled around 3am. I was obviously panicking, but mostly because I wanted to make sure my best friend made it to the party in her honor. She managed to re-book on a different flight for an extra $350, which I couldn’t afford for myself. As unfortunate as it was, I came to the conclusion that I would not be able to attend the bachelorette party, but could at least appreciate the fact that I did my job to make sure the future bride made it. The flights were unfortunately non-refundable, so I was already out $400, and I spent the entire weekend crying that I was missing my best friend’s bachelorette party.

Throughout the course of the weekend, her two older sisters who had booked the Airbnb continuously reached out to me to try and convince me to fly out just for a night, despite me repeatedly telling them I couldn’t afford to do so. I began to feel like they just wanted me there to fill space and contribute to the cost of the Airbnb that they had already paid for.

Lo and behold, I was correct. A day after the bachelorette party, the two sisters reached out to me telling me it’s the mature adult thing to do and just pay for my share of the hotel, despite never so much as having stepped foot in the city. She originally asked me for $425, but then asked for $330. Should I still have to pay? Am I the asshole?",yta
"title: AITA for not paying fully for my daughter's college but paying for my stepdaughter?
content: I have one daughter (Sarah) and a stepdaughter (Karly). Sarah's mom and I divorced when Sarah was 13. Regrettably, Sarah and I do not have a close relationship as I live in a different state and her mom had full custody and I only got visitations. I met my wife 1 year after my divorce and she and Kate moved in with me when we got serious. Sarah refused to come to the wedding and did not bother to get to know my wife and Kate.

During our divorce proceedings, my ex and I agreed that we would each put aside 40k for Sarah's college, enough for 4 years. There is 90k in that account (my ex added a bit more). To be honest, Sarah was never interested in college nor did she do well in school so I didn't really think about it.

Since Sarah is graduating this summer, she came to me and told me she had gotten into a very fancy fashion school that was more expensive than the budget as she would be an out-of-state student as well. She asked if I would pay for it and I said no. I and her mother agreed on the cost and as I am paying for Kate as well I cannot afford it. Kate got early admission into an elite university for medicine and I promised my wife I would take care of it.

Sarah started yelling at me and behaving in a very childish manner. She said I abandoned her and her mom and favored Kate. None of that is true. I told her she had plenty of money for her college and quite frankly paying that much to study fashion is ridiculous. She cussed me out and left. I was very angry as she came to see me in my office and all my coworkers heard her.

I texted her that I expected an apology and she texted back cussing me out and uninviting me from her graduation which was this past week. We haven't spoken since and she has blocked me on everything.

Edit: I see a lot of assumptions about my parenting already. Please judge what's being asked. I did my best with Sarah, the only reason I moved was so I could make more money to send to her, so she could go to private school and have the same lifestyle she did when I was married. I showed up for every single visitation and traveled every single time. The only time she was expected to travel to me was for my wedding which she refused to do.

My ex resented me for starting the divorce preceding and she and Sarah view my wanting a divorce as me abandoning Sarah. I did my best to make my marriage work but it just didn't. There was plenty of alienation from my wife's side especially after I got married. I spent plenty of visitation days in a hotel room because Sarah wouldn't come out of her house to see me.

I did my best to be there for her. She knew all along what the budget for her school was, if she had told me a year or two ago that she was planning on attending this school I could have saved up but this is just too last minute and I do not have the money.

Edit 2: I studied art and I have no issue with her choosing fashion. But paying that much is not necessary for that degree. Different degrees require different levels of cost. There are better schools that Sarah can afford. You do not pay the same for an art degree as you do for an engineering degree. Her 4 years cost as much as Kate's 7 years of med school. That's insane.

As for Kate, I am paying less for her than I am with Sarah as me, my wife and Kate's dad share the cost.

Edit 3: Sorry for mixing up Kate/Karly's name, I am not used to using fake names. I will go over the post and try and fix it.",yta
"title: AITA for not paying more after the fact?
content: I had a motor accident which was completely my fault. I opened my car door without looking and this scoorter was riding super close to my car and got hit. The person fell over and I immediately apologized. Took him to an authorised service centre and upon a surface inspection, they quoted an estimate and I gave him the money for the estimate without question. I stayed at the spot for another 10 minutes in case any additional unnoticed damage was charged. Finally, he said that he'll take the vehicle to his own mechanic and get it fixed there so we parted ways.

4 days later he hits me up with a hand-written invoice claiming DOUBLE the amount. He says that there was internal damage to the scooter and that I have to pay for the same.

I outright refused because I paid him an estimate we had agreed upon. I said if he wanted he could have had the vehicle checked by the service center at that spot but he wanted to save a few bucks by taking it to his own mechanic and that's on him. I also can't pay for damages that are claimed 4 days after the accident because I have no way of knowing if the internal damage was actually caused by my vehicle.

Did I do.anything wrong here? I genuinely don't think I owe him any more money now.",nta
"title: AITA for not picking up the diarrhea my dog had?
content: I never leave poop behind if I can help it. There’s been times I’ve had to leave it till the next walk because my husband used the last bag and didn’t swap the roll but I’ll come back and pick it up every time. I don’t want to be the person that leaves it behind ti be stepped in because I would hope others would do the same. Of course you can’t always get it all like I couldn’t today but you do your best.
So my good boy today I’m guessing had a sore stomach since he was panting and acted like he wanted out so I took him for a walk. Not even 2 minutes in and he was Hershey squirting. It was a lot and it was gross. Kinda like watery porridge consistency. I picked up what I could, needed two bags but of course couldn’t get all the grass cleaned off. Jackson and I kept walking and went around the corner of the building we were in front of. Now let me tell you this is Jackson’s poop spot. He poops there everyday so these people have for sure seen me before and if they haven’t that’s crazy because he’s been pooping there since I got him about 6 maybe 7 months ago so you would think they’ve seen me pick it up before. 
Anyway, he squatted again but this time really nothing came out but some liquid and the smallest amount of fecal matter. Now when I say a small amount I mean like the size of a quarter or smaller. If I tried to pick it up I would have needed to dig it out to get it or use a bag and smush it in when I’m trying not to and waste a bag. When my poor boy was done dripping I turned to walk and a person banged on their window at me. I couldn’t see from where since there was a glare but this is a three story building. I think it was the second story since the window appeared to be shaking and no others were.
I gestured to the fact that there was nothing there while saying so as though they could hear me and pointed at my two bags and said that I would pick it up if there were something there to pick up and that I was sorry but I wasn’t wasting a bag to pretend to pick something up and then kept walking.
Part of me feels offended since I am always sure to pick up my big boy’s poop and that the time I had nothing to pick up I was being watched. The other part of me says that I should have wasted the bag on it. I asked my hubby what he thought and he said people suck but I still have part of me that’s on window banger’s side.

So am I the ass hole?
For anyone who may ask, Jackson is half Great Dane and half Labradoodle so a big dog at 9 months hence two bags. Yes I will try to post a dog tax photo in the comments. I’m writing from my phone so I apologize for the format.

Thanks for reading. Hope you have a great day!!!",info
"title: AITA for not playing any child support?
content: My ex-girlfriend, Claire (35F), got pregnant while we were dating. Although she told me she just wanted to be friends, I was ready to be a father. However, she met someone else, Becca, who didn't want me around, so they asked me to cancel my paternal rights.

At the time, I was torn because I wanted to be there for my child, but I also felt that if they didn't want me around, it was best to waive my rights. After fighting for a while, I eventually gave up because it was clear that they didn't want me there. Fast forward 13 years later, Claire and Becca are going through some stuff, and they want me to pay child support.

However, the court had already ruled that since I waived my paternal rights, I am not legally obliged to pay child support. Despite this, Claire is calling me a bastard and a deadbeat, and she's even calling my family and getting them involved. While I understand her frustration, I don't think it's appropriate for her to be involving my family in this matter.",nta
"title: AITA for not praising my boyfriend’s cooking efforts when he made boxed mac and cheese
content: My bf (33,M) and I (36,F) and I have been dating for nine months now. He doesn’t know how to cook, and this is the cause of tension between us. 

When he eats alone it is usually a mix of instant ramen/ready to heat frozen meals/cereals/and portioned meals his mother gives him. I don’t eat meat and can’t eat many of these and a few months into the relationship it became clear he can’t prepare food for us both.

I asked him why he doesn’t cook and he said it’s a mix of ‘not needing to’ and ‘being scared of it’. He said he doesn’t like how cooking has lots of elements that need to come together at different times and finds it stressful. 

He expressed a desire to learn to cook so I started to teach him. So far I have shown him how to make deli style sandwiches, cheese omelettes, and pizza (nothing fancy, the kind where you buy the pre-made base and add toppings). Teaching him requires me to help him make a list of ingredients, and go to the supermarket to help purchase them, because he finds it ‘easier when I’m there to do that’. 

When I show him how to cook I try to be patient and careful with him because I want him to have a good association with the experience. I praise everything he does and when we sit down to eat I thank him. But sometimes I find it challenging. For example, when we made pizzas he asked me if I put tomato on my base before or after oregano. I said it didn’t matter and he got upset with me for ‘not just telling him the right answer’. This led to a fight. I’ve tried to explain to him that it doesn’t matter if a meal isn’t perfect, we just need to eat. I sometimes wonder if he has a learning disorder or similar but he is smart and good at learning in other areas of his life. He does clean up and do the dishes after we cook. He always thanks me for cooking.

Recently he has been sending me pictures of food he cooks himself. The other day he messaged me a picture of some boxed mac and cheese with broccoli and told me he was pleased with it. I didn’t reply and changed the subject. Later he told me he was sad I didn’t say something nice about it because he was proud of himself.

I know the polite and good thing to do would have been to reply with something encouraging but I feel like I’m already doing a lot to teach him cooking and don’t want to be a 24/7 cheerleader as well. I’m doing all of the mental load of organizing food for us as a couple - usually when we dine out I pick the place and often he asks me what I think he should order. Being in the role of ‘cooking/food coach’ is ok one or two nights of the week and I want him to feel confident but sometimes I just need a break. There’s something about the dynamic that isn’t attractive to me - it’s like I’m his Mom and he is looking at me for approval.

"title: AITA for not reminding my girlfriend to come get me after she forgot me in a car for an hour?
content: 
This past weekend, my (21F) girlfriend (22 F) decided to make the two hour drive to her University for her graduation ceremony. She had just moved to my town this month, and did not want to go through the whole 4 hour long graduation ceremony, but she did want to go up and take pictures and say goodbye to her friends before they all disbursed over the country.

My girlfriend asked me to make the drive with her (4 hours in total). I did not really want to go, but we have been going through a rough patch and I thought this would be a good way to spend some much needed time together. Plus, we have been together 2 years, so it was all of our mutual friends graduating and I wanted to say goodbye to everyone and see them all one last time.

So, we left at 8 AM on a Sunday and made the drive. When we got there, it was chaos. Everyone was leaving the auditorium, and there was a massive crowd. I told her that I would go and find a place to park the car, and she could go find our friends and figure out what the plan was. I told her that I would text her where I parked, and I would stay in the car until she called or texted me to tell me where we were meeting, and if she didn't call me then I would assume that we were meeting at the car, which she agreed to.

So I parked the car only about a 5-10 minuet walk from where I dropped her off, and texted her where I was. She responded saying ""Okay"" and then I sat in the car and proceeded to wait over an hour. I thought it was weird, but I figured she was just having a hard time finding everyone in the crowd. Plus, I just trusted her to contact me when she found everyone.

When she finally gets back, she told me that she found everyone and had been taking pictures and saying goodbye to everyone. She said it was an accident and just got caught up in the confusion of the crowd. I was hurt, but asked where they were and if we were meeting up somewhere. She reluctantly told me that all of our friends had left with their families right after the ceremony, and that they were gone. Some of them out of the country, I might add, so I totally missed my chance to say goodbye to them.

I was heartbroken that she left me out of the plans she had begged me to come to. She knew where I was parked, and she could have easily asked me to meet them.

Seeing as we still have a 2 hour drive home, and it was technically her graduation day, I told her that ""we can talk about this later because I don't want to ruin your graduation day.""

So today I was (obviously) in a mood, and she asked me if I was mad at her. I was like... ""Of CORSE I'm mad at you... you left me in the car like a dog...""

I guess she took me saying ""It's fine we can talk about it later"" as ""Don't worry about it we're fine"".

She then told me: ""Even though I forgot you, if you thought that then why didn't you call or text me?""

AITA for not just letting it go? Should I have called or texted her after it had been a long time?

EDIT 1: I should clarify that she drove up, I was car company. I wasn’t sitting in the car to “have a reason to be angry with her” I just genuinely trusted the plan. I wasn’t angry until she came back and told me what had happened. I was happily sitting in the car reading my book and watching tiktoks! 
Also I did not want to ruin her grad which is why I told her we could talk about it later! After words we got lunch and I have her her graduation present, I just thought we’d talk about it the next day but she seemed to think it was fine now.

Edit 2: I should probably also add that when I said “wait for the plan”’it is because I had no idea if we were all going somewhere after the ceremony, like to get lunch or to go to a park to take pics, or if we were all just going to meet there. My GF didn’t know either so that’s why she went to ask everyone. 
And when I said “I didn’t really want to go” it is because I asked my GF to make a plan with everyone beforehand so this exact thing wouldn’t happen, but she was intent on just showing up and playing it by ear. I’m a plan person so things like that stress me out! Also, we have been having problems lately and she’s been ditching me a lot which is why I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go, but I decided that the 4 hours in the car would be some 1 on 1 time that we really needed! 

Also: I can understand why a lot of people are saying that it was her graduation, and it wasn’t about me, which I totally get! But I should mention was a big ceremony for the graduates in December that I went all out for! I was the photographer, I did her make up and hair, I got her presents and apartment for a little congratulations party! (I did also get her a nice graduation present for this too which I gave her for when we got home and she loved!)",info
"title: AITA for not renewing my lease with my brother?
content: I, 37f, had to move back home due to the pandemic. It wasn’t an ideal situation as I don’t have the best relationship with my parents. My younger siblings, 19f, 20m, and 23m lived there as well. Our family dynamic isn’t the best and I knew I wasn’t going to be there long since my father is a bit of a control freak. After about a year of arguments and overall depression, I knew I had to leave. 

My father would verbally kick us all out on a daily basis and I got tired of it. My mom left years prior but still talked to him but had her own issues with him as well. When I decided to look for an apartment, I asked my little brother, 23m if he wanted to get an apartment together since I knew living there was affecting us all. My other brother moved in with his girlfriend and me and my brother got our own place. 

Now, we’ve always had a good relationship so I didn’t think it would be bad. And he told me before that he’s had his own place but had to move back home because of financial issues. We discussed the living arrangement and agreed to buy our own food and necessities, and split the bills evenly. 

Now, a year and a half later, I’m crawling up the walls. He doesn’t clean, he doesn’t take the trash out, and eats up all of my food. He brings 2-3 girls by a week and have left some in the apartment while he was at work. I WFH and he never told me they were there, I was just surprised to hear someone in the apartment when I knew he was at work. 

Our lease is up in six months and I told him that I’m moving on my own and will not be renewing it. Now he refuses to talk to me and avoids me if I’m home. I have asked him to clean up after himself and not to eat my food as I am on a budget. His response was that I ate it all and I work from home so it’s easier for me to clean. 

I spoke with my mother about it and she said that we all grow at our own pace and then told me that he had never had his own place so she doesn’t think that he knew exactly what he was getting into. She understands where I’m coming from but I can’t help to feel like I’m being the asshole since he has been avoiding me. AITA?",nta

As he left to get something ready-made from the store, he said “Just one more failure to add to my list of epic failures.” And I didn’t respond, because I’ve learned these last couple months that countering that kind of statement doesn’t help; it just prompts him to continue his negative self-talk.  For example, if I say, “You’re not a failure, you didn’t do anything to cause this,” he will just double down.  As he was leaving the house, he said “I guess that is what you think then” regarding the fact that I didn’t protest when he made the failure comment.  But I don’t believe he is a failure, I just don’t think it’s helping to respond to those comments anymore.  He’s been cold to me ever since.  I know he’s been feeling down, but it’s frankly exhausting to reply to those kinds of comments when it doesn’t seem to help.  AITA for not responding when my spouse talked about his “failures”?",nta
"title: AITA for not rubbing my sisters belly?
content: I 28F was in my hometown visiting last weekend for a family reunion/ baby shower for my sister 26F. I live in another province with my partner and haven’t seen my family in a while and haven’t been physically present during my sisters pregnancy. I just want to clarify that I’m not a touchy person but also that I find pregnant bellies kind of gross looking. I would never say this to anyone but felt that it is an important detail here. 
During the baby shower my sister was going around to everyone and getting them to rub her belly so they could feel the baby kicking. When she came up to me I politely declined. She started insisting that the aunt should feel the baby and tried to grab my hand to put on her stomach. I told her that I was uncomfortable and didn’t want to, and tried to gently shake her off of me. She did not react well to this and started crying that I must think her belly disgusting to touch and that I’m hurting her feelings. When I didn’t immediately disagree with her statement she started crying more. Others in the family started telling me to just feel the baby’s movements and I being a brat about it. 

I was getting so hounded by most of the family that I left early. I’m still getting phone calls and messages from the family about how disrespectful and hurtful I was towards my sister.",nta
"title: AITA for not saying anything about the underwear?
content: My 20 year old daughter and her fiancé are currently staying with us. I love my daughter but she is very difficult and I can’t stand her fiancé. I gave them a deadline to move out because I can’t take this anymore. 

They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife’s underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.

She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn’t realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.

My daughter burst into tears and won’t talk to me. Her fiancé said we’re fucked and left the house but my wife thought it was funny.",yta
"title: AITA for not saying bye to my mother before leaving the house for school?
content: I (F21) live at my mothers (F43) house while going to college. Today I was having a rough morning. Woke up late at (5:30 instead of 5 ) and was rushing to make it on time for my commute to campus 1 hour and 30 minutes away (first class at 8 am but traffic and finding parking is crazy)  

I was looking for a pair of sandals which I could not find anywhere in my room so I went out to the living room to check by the couches. Quietly knocked on my sisters (F25) room door to see if she had them. Often times my mom and sister wear them around the house so I figured they might have seen them or have them. 

 I went back to my room to continue looking for them, and a couple things slipped making some noise. My mom who was already awake and using her phone then yells at the top of her lungs from her room (our rooms are connected by a hallway) telling me to was 6:30 am, which in her way was telling me to be quiet. Whatever I was already done looking and settled for a different pair of shoes. 

That isn’t enough though, she gets up from her bed, opens my door again to continue on saying the same thing explaining how early it is for me to be looking for something. At this point she is making more noise than I am. 

Finally after like 5 minutes I just wear whatever shoes I find first, and get ready to leave. I was all dressed up the only thing holding me back was not having shoes on. I walk out of my room and into the living room and my mother is in the kitchen which is directly across our front door. I walk out the door without saying anything to avoid a fight at 6:30 am like she said. My mother always finds something to argue about and always has to be right so most of our discussions often get heated regardless of what the topic is because she gets so defensive. So again, I just walk out to avoid any more comments or lectures about the sandals. 

My mom then makes a comment about me not even saying Bye, and even though I hear her I just continue my walk. By this time I am down the stairs of our apartment and she walks out the front door to continue saying things. I ignore her again and get in my car to start my drive to school. 

40 mins into my drive I receive text messages from my mom where she is telling me that my bad attitude so early in the mornings are not her fault and that she feels unappreciated and calling me ungrateful in comparison to my older sister. She sends another text telling me I am free to move out and I can’t help but laugh seeing as how all of this came from me being upset over being late and not finding my sandals, with nothing to do with her and yet she has inserted herself. 

So I have to ask, am I the asshole?",yta
"title: AITA for not saying hello to my dad
content: I have a very sore throat today to the point it kind of hurts to talk and my Dad was aware of this. Today my dad came home from the store today and was on the phone. I was making my lunch when he put his plastic bag on the counter where I was cutting my sandwich. I then moved the bag in which he said in the language he talks (Hausa), “How dare you touch my plastic bag and you don’t even greet me. What’s wrong with you.” I didn’t respond in which he said, “so now you won’t respond to me. Your being really disrespectful and it’s really hurting my feelings.” (Again in Hausa). I said it’s not a big deal in which he basically said I was disrespectful, arrogant, selfish and rude for not greeting him and asking him how he is. I then said I was going to say hello but he was on the phone. He then said I was making excuses by saying I have a sore throat and that I was on the phone. I understand that it was rude to talk back and to not greet him genuinely don’t think it’s that serious. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not saying thank you for something I didn’t want and didn’t like?
content: I (25nb) live with my three roommates, Kate (26f), Emma (26f), and Raven (25nb). We were all friends before and it generally goes well. 

Kate and Emma decided to throw a “dinner party” the other day for the four of us. (We usually eat separately in our rooms or together while watching tv.) they made a few fancy dishes and we were all going to eat it at the table with a tablecloth and Emma’s grandparents’ dishes, which seemed a little like overkill to me, but whatever. 

So the problem is, Raven and I don’t drink alcohol. I don’t like the burn, and Raven doesn’t really like anything fermented. Emma and Kate do drink sometimes, and I personally think it’s a questionable decision, but I dont really judge them for it or anything. 

As part of the dinner party, Emma and Kate were going to drink some red wine. Ok, fine. Then Kate got a big smile on her face and brought out a bottle of de-alcoholized red wine, which I didn’t even know existed. She acted like it was a nice surprise for us and poured some “so we wouldn’t feel left out”. 

I didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so I did try some, and it was like gross spoiled grape juice. I think i said exactly, “I wouldn’t want to have this every day”. Then Raven tried theirs and said, “It tastes weird.” Kate said, “Maybe it’s just different from what you’re used to”. I agreed with Raven though and said it tasted like rotten fruit. Kate and Emma started looking really sad and uncomfortable and none of us really said anything during dinner. It was super awkward. 

Yesterday (the day after), I overheard the two of them whispering about it when they definitely didn’t know I was listening. Kate said, “I wish they would have just said thank you.” She also claimed we were really ungrateful for the work they put in around the house in general. But I don’t think I should have said thank you for something I didn’t ask for. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for not saying “thank you”
content: My(F27) boyfriend(M25) said that I was rude for not saying “thank you” after he went out with the trash. I honestly don’t understand. 

So yesterday I cleaned, cooked and did both our laundry. He was sat gaming all day, that’s fine I told him to do what he wanted so that he wouldn’t be in my way when cleaning. I cooked dinner, cleaned the kitchen and organized the trash to take outside, I then asked him if he could take it outside and he said “yes before bed” and I said ok. Bedtime comes and the trash is still there and I think “ok, do I do it myself or what”. I asked him about it and he said tomorrow and I said ok. Tomorrow arrives and the trash is still there. And I think “I have to do this my self, but I only asked him for 1 thing and I do everything else around here” so I asked again when he was about to go out with the trash, he didn’t answer and when it was bedtime I woke up at 2 and he was going out with the trash in the middle of the night. 

He said today that he felt hurt that I didn’t say “thank you” when he took the trash out. I said that I am sorry he felt hurt and that I didn’t think about saying it. And he said he felt unappreciated and I said that’s sad, but if he could think of a time where he said “thank you“ to me for cleaning, cooking etc. he didn’t answer and said I was rude again.

"title: AITA for not sharing food with my roommate anymore
content: My roommate (21F) and I (20F) have spent  the spring semester in dorms, and things were going smoothly.

When setting up boundaries and rules for one another, we agreed upon having a shared pantry/food and snacks area.

Knowing how badly the food at my campus hurts/irritated my stomach, I decided to put some money in monthly ($100 per month) towards groceries such as cereal, noodles, almond milk, and more to keep me nourished for my major (a very physical one).

This idea of halving the food went well at first. I did not mind her taking from the pantry occasionally, and at one time she had a cheese itz box that I could eat from. However, that was it. At one point she stole 3 of my noodle cups (that I personally kept on my shelf that wasn’t to be shared) in one night and ate them all. However, since she told me she had a bad day and needed something to eat I didn’t pay much mind. From time to time I would also notice my food going away faster than usual. 

My feelings towards sharing started shifting when I had ordered entire pizzas for myself and her. On two occasions I chipped in all my money for a pizza, was promised to be paid back, but never was. And when she ordered pizza I split the check. The next day when I was hungry and had no meal swipes left, I noticed and asked if I could borrow some food from her. Which she has (kraft mac and cheese cups and other stuff she personally keeps). I was rejected and told “I don’t have any snacks.”

Now that i’ve bought groceries again i’ve kept them on my side out of her reach without explanation. It’s the end of the semester, so I didn’t feel like having a discussion would be useful.

"title: AITA for not shaving my legs for work?
content: So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.
AITA for not shaving my legs for my job?

"title: AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?
content: My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.

We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.

When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.

This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes. 

Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.

And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.

And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless. AITA, Reddit?",info
"title: AITA for not supporting my sisters engagement?
content: My sister (36f) and I (31f) have always been very close, she’s my best friend. She recently left her husband for her best friend (40 something f). Friend and I have bad blood. We used to work together and were friends but I quickly learned how toxic she is (lazy, problems with authority, lack of accountability, intimidating, made people feel bad for working hard). I asked my supervisor to have me moved so I didn’t have to work with her anymore. 

She found out and saw me as a snitch. Turned a lot of people against me. 

I didn’t bring my sister into it because I respected their friendship. But she knew how hurt I was by this.

About a year went by and the friend lost someone close to her tragically, and her wife had filed for divorce. Having been her friend, I knew how hurt she must have been so reached out to offer condolences and to apologize for the misunderstanding, and she accepted but it was still awkward. This isn’t someone I wanted in my life though, so I just moved on and was happy that we could be civil when we had to see each other. 

Few months later, my sister leaves her loveless marriage (together for about 10 years, married for about 3). This needed to happen. She moved in with her best friend of course. A few weeks go by and I hear a rumor at work that they’re more than friends. My sister confirms it, expressed her worry because of the awkwardness between the friend and me and didn’t want anything to come between us. I told her I was worried they were moving fast, possibly rebounding, but I was happy if she was happy. 

Next day our mother dies of lung cancer and I’m still absolutely gutted. And my sister wasn’t there for me because she was busy with her new relationship. Things changed and something definitely came between us, so my feelings about it all quickly turned sour. I was always honest with my sister about my feelings, but made it clear I wasn’t asking her to choose but to maybe consider me a bit more. I was feeling left behind and I was in a really dark place, no immediate family left. 

Then she texts me one night saying she proposed and the friend said yes. I was devastated. I knew it would hurt her that I wasn’t feeling happy for her but I responded with my concerns. Her divorce wasn’t final yet and I was concerned with how fast this was going. Only 6 months of dating. She didn’t respond. But the friend texted me the next day with this long nasty message basically saying I’m shitty and selfish for not jumping for joy. I asked her to please leave it between my sister and me and that I was only looking out for her. She came back with more personal attacks. When I told my sister, she defended the friend and that really stung. We fought. Eventually I agreed to try and work things out with the friend for my sisters sake and was rejected and insulted further.

"title: AITA for not sympathizing with my work friend and telling her she should know better?
content: 25M I work a mundane office job in middle corporate America and spent most days hating whatever decisions I made to get me to this point. One of the people I am closer with is “Ash” 24F. We are the only people under 30 in the office so that’s why we’ve gotten closer. 

Yesterday, we had our “spring cleaning” day. This is where we were instructed to wear comfy clothes we can beat up in order to clean the office. We were instructed to wear jeans and a t shirt or whatever was comfortable and similar to that. No sweat pants though. 

The short version is that Ash was called into our bosses office and spoken to about her outfit choice. Which was jeans and a cropped sweater. I guess they just told her that wearing a cropped sweater that went just above her navel was inappropriate work attire even in a situation like this. Boss gave her an old t shirt with the company logo to change into.  

Ash spent the next 30 minutes yapping my fricking ear off about how it’s unfair, sexist, and embarrassing that she was spoken to about her outfit.  She said she was wearing jeans, and wore a comfortable top that she could get dirty and that is exactly what boss said we should wear. 

After growing tired of listening to her, I told her that i don’t feel bad for her and that she made a dumb decision. She accused me of being as “sexist” as our boss. I told her she’s in a corporate job, and she’s not 16 so frankly she should know better and that it doesn’t take a genius to know you should probably have shoulders to knees covered in a work setting.

"title: AITA for not taking my daughter’s side?
content: 
(English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors.)

We'll refer to my husband, ""Josh"" (he isn't Penelope’s biological father), as well as my four kids as Oliver, Cath, Kate, and Penelope. Josh was unkind to Penelope in the past, which caused our separation. However, one and a half years later, we made the decision to attempt to mend our relationship because we truly loved each other, Josh was no longer unkind to Penelope in the past, and we had three children together. (To emphasize, Penelope was omitted because she is not Josh's biological daughter.) 

The issue starts right here: 
My other children wanted to watch, too, as Penelope had been watching TV for VIRTUALLY the whole day. Josh handled everything because I was working at the time. A short while later, I hear Penelope screaming violently at Josh, so I went downstairs to see what was going on.  Basically, this is what she told me:
Josh: P, stop staring at that TV, let your siblings watch.
Penelope: After I finish this final episode, they can binge watch it till they pass out on the couch.

Kate apparently began sobbing excessively because she wanted to see her show. So, Josh stopped Penelope from finishing her episode and told her that she may continue it later before taking the remote and giving it to Kate That’s when Penelope started yelling. 

Here's where I believe I am the a-hole:
Penelope said that since I, not Josh, had purchased the couch, they could watch on the floor. We genuinely believed she was joking, but she wasn't kidding. I told her, we are family, and families share things. Then she began ranting about how Josh had never treated her like family and that, therefore, they aren't. Josh became irate and said she had been watching on the television he bought while he kept silent. 

I told her that it was true, so if she really intended to play that type of game, then be it. She broke down in tears and dumped an entire glass of juice on the couch. Josh and I were both angry and yelled at her to go to her room. Now that her grandmother has said I was too harsh on her, I am starting to question if I was the jerk. Oliver advised me to put this here so that others could judge whether or not I am the a-hole. Thank you in advance for your response.",yta
"title: AITA for not taking my girlfriend to a Original Star Wars Trilogy Screening?
content: I am sorry for any formatting issues in advance. I am on mobile.

My girlfriend is not a Star Wars fan. She is the kind of person to binge watch all three seasons of the Mandalorian, but finds the original trilogy boring. To each their own I guess. 

Me and my girlfriend have been together for a grand total of six years and we have a four year old daughter. 

This year for May 4, Star Wars day, a local theater was hosting a screening of the original Star Wars trilogy, and obviously being a fan I bought myself a ticket. I also made childcare arrangements for my daughter since such a long trip at the movie theater would not be good for her, so she likely would not behave the entire time. 

As I was making arrangements, my girlfriend was asking if she could come too. I said no. 

For context, every time I have taken her on a date which included seeing a Star Wars movie in theaters, including the new sequel trilogy, there was always an argument on the drive to the movie theater. To give you an idea, one of the arguments was about something I said during a classic Simpsons episode on Disney+. There was a scene where Marge was initiating what she calls “snuggling“ and I said something like “yeah Homer get some!“ my girlfriend held onto this for weeks and decided that the drive to the movies was the perfect time to discuss why she was offended by that statement. After going to a grand total of four Star Wars movies, and each of them are being proceeded with an argument, I told her I would never take her to a Star Wars movie again. She agreed. 

When I reminded her of my reasons above, she got upset and said she didn’t want to talk to me. I took our daughter to my mom‘s house, sent my girlfriend a message that I loved her and hoped that she enjoyed her free time. Seeing the original trilogy on the big screen for the first time was definitely an experience I will never forget.

Things have been mostly fine since the weekend but now my girlfriend is saying that she felt excluded since I decided to go to the movies by myself. I feel conflicted now and a bit guilty. I understand that she feels this way, but I did not want another huge argument right before a Star Wars movie, thus ruining the mood throughout the entire movie. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for not taking my pregnant homophobic sister in?
content: My sister (20f) and I (27f) don’t get along. I’m gay, and when she was 14 she started being horrible to me, calling me slurs and saying I was going to burn in hell and other typical religious homophobic things. She is the golden child so obviously my parents sided with her, she would make me cry and they would tell me to deal with it and expected me to still be nice to her. After a while, I cut them all out of my life. Best decision ever.

3 years ago I married the love of my life, my parents were invited but they didn’t show, no doubt because of my sister. Still hurt. My wife L and I are both very lucky and have amazing jobs and a big house. About a week ago, my parents and sister showed up to my house (no idea how they know I live there) and wanted to talk to me. Turns out sister’s pregnant and they essentially want me to let her move in for free AND pay for everything for her and the baby. There was no apology for anything. I was in shock and my sister was going off about how we have so much space and we could afford to help her out.

I said no. I told them we couldn’t take her in because we currently have L’s two little half sisters staying with us because their mom is very high risk, so we don’t have anymore space. They were pissed and were going off about how I was supposed to help my family and that I was choosing L’s family over my own, I told them they were not my family. I told them everything they had done and say to me and they said I needed to let it go and move on. I asked them to leave. Even if we had space I wouldn’t want her here.

Since then I have gotten so many messages from them and other family members saying I need to help them and take her in. I reminded them of what she has been like to me, and they say I need to be the bigger person and that this will bring us together. Thing is, my parents are going to have to take money out of their retirement fund if I don’t help. They were good parents growing up, when my sister started her bs I was already out of the house. So people have said that i would really be helping them, not my sister. L said we could give her some money, but I don’t want to do that either. AITA?

Edited because I forgot to add that I don’t feel for her at all, I just feel bad about my parents.


Update - thank you all for the kind words! We are not taking her in but might give my parents some money in the future if we see they are struggling. 
Also, my sister is 7 months pregnant and just recently told my parents because she couldn’t hide it anymore, so they are desperate because there’s no time to save up now. My mom just sent me my sister’s baby registry and I can’t believe her!!! She is living off my parents and doesn’t have a job but is asking people to get her a $300 car seat and a $700 stroller.

Edit - Please don’t post this anywhere.


Edit- Wow! I came back to like a thousand more replies, seriously thank you all for your advice. Yes, I know my parents are also to blame. They have never been ‘homophobic’ but they never told her off because they wanted to ‘keep the peace’ and I know that’s a shitty excuse but I would only see them like once a month while my sister was there full time and they never want to upset her. And the wedding - my dad called me because my sister was upset she wasn’t invited and asked me to invite her but I said no so they didn’t show up. 

The main reason I feel like I need to help them is because they put me through college. I got a scholarship and my parents paid for the rest which was still a lot of money. My sister went to a community college so they didn’t pay nearly as much for her.
Thank you all again!",nta
"title: AITA for not taking out the chicken from the freezer?
content: For context, i (23F) live with my bf (22M), we agreed on food early in the morning and when i went to pick him up from work(8pm) i realized i didnt take the chicken out for dinner. I offered to buy fast food but he was really mad at me and treating me poorly over one small mistake. He had a 4hr shift and i was home all day. He said he was disappointed in me and that i had one thing to do. For some more context we spent the morning together till around 3:30pm and he left for work. I was doing my routine of cleaning and yoga/workout, shower and by the time i was done i had to get ready to go pick him up (35min drive). We argued in the car for a good while and i felt like i was in the wrong but was trying to fix it but then he kept treating me poorly after i was trying to fix it.",nta
"title: AITA for not taking over full care of our guinea pigs before moving out?
content: Might seem petty or small to some of y'all but here we go.
 
5 years ago my parents allowed my sister (17F) and I (20M) to get a guinea pig (Timothy) and a year later we got him company (Peanut). My sister and I have always split their care 50/50, each one cleans their enclosures (they have separate enclosures but they enjoy being neighbors), and we alternate each week on who feeds them in the morning and at night. 

I am going to be moving out with my partner 2 hours away. At first I considered taking Timothy since hes a senior citizen and I'm the only one in the family that has been taking him to the vet and giving him his proper care (he's been having health issues). My sister and mom were against it and we agreed that it would be too stressful for Timothy to move, and that both would get depressed if they were separated. Since I'm going to move out in a couple weeks, I've been catching up my sister and my mom on the special care/diet that Timothy needs. I started taking over the ""morning shift"" 2 mo. ago as well, again, because of Timothy's health but I don't complain because his health is my priority. 

Now to the argument, I've been going to the house I'm moving to these last few months during the weekends (Fri afternoon-Sun afternoon) we've been remodeling the house and getting everything set up to move in. My sister argues with me that since she has to give them full care on the weekends when I'm not there, I should take full care of them Mon-Thurs. I do have to add that I make sure to care for them Friday morning and Sunday nights because I have considered how it can be unfair to my sister. Now, her point to make is that I should take FULL care of them (except the times I'm not there) because I'm leaving and she's going to have to take full responsibility of them when I'm no longer there. Shes gone as far as to neglect them at night and proceeds to blame it on me in the morning when I give them their morning care. 

I feel bad because I dont want to leave my babies behind and I would take them with me if I could, but my sister needs to take responsibility since I'm leaving soon. At the same time, I do see her point, we bought the piggies together and agreed to take care of them together and now I'm breaking that agreement by leaving it all to her with me moving out. 

My parents are slightly leaning on my side and my mom says she's willing to split the care with my sister since I've done all I could, but I cant help feel like TA, especially since she's grown distant from me because of it and that the piggies are being neglected because I'm just not taking ""night shift"" too. 

[Also just in case: Timothy may need extra attention and care becauss of his declining health, but I try to make sure Peanut also gets equal love and attention so he knows we care about him too... Yes these piggies are spoiled]",nta
"title: AITA for not telling my cousin my fiance works at the same office as her husband?
content: First/only post, I mainly lurk. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.

I have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of ""just trying to help"", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. 

I'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)

Kat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to ""let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding"". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.

Literally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment ""tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering"". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my ""duty"" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was ""blindsided"" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not telling my family they wouldn't get anything of my grandpa's inheritance and doing as I see fit with it?
content: **Edit: Please stop giving me legal advice. We have a lawyer. This is not a question about legality but mortality.**



My grandpa had stage 4 lumbar cancer and was in hospice care for the last weeks of his life.

My family was mostly not involved to hostile during this 

Anyways.we found out Grandpa  had cancer 2 years ago. My family started to act like lunatics. But not in the way of concerned family members. But like performative assholes.

The only ones really carrying were my cousins and I.

You know the movie knives out? Like that. Every conversation, they brought up the will and asked him to give them their share as to avoid paying inheritance tax.

Then, when the cancer progressed, he said he didn't want  interventions and just wanted to live his last months in peace.

But because there had not been any ""adjustments "" to the will, my family was pushing for a court order for further treatment. While that was happening, my aunt moved herself into the house. 
My cousin later told me it was so she could make claims on it after he was gone.

She is not a medical professional. But she made him go keto or paleo. He was too weak to fight her on that.

So my cousins and I started to go over and take him out  . But instead of taking him to the park, we would take him to the horses, cinema , pubs, etc. Basically, he had a bucket list, and we would sneak him out to do that. We would also sneak in foods he wanted. And the night before he went to hospice care, we shared a few glasses of whiskey with him and a cigar. That night, he told us we were the sole inheritors of hid estate. With our oldest cousin being the executor of it. He asked us not to say anything. He just needed us to sign something.

He passed away a week after.
When our parents got wind of the situation and that they had only been given 5k each, all hell broke loose. 
Our parents are really mad at us. They have kicked us out and are saying that they are going to cut off contact, if we don't do the right thing and give them what's theirs .

Are we the assholes for not telling them about anything and not giving them their ""share""?

"title: AITA for not telling my mom I’m going on vacation
content: Im a 20 year old girl, still in college, turning 21 next month and I live at home with my mom. This summer I’ll be having my 5 year anniversary with my boyfriend. 

A few months ago, my mom told me she was going on vacation in August, specifically a 3 day weekend for a cruise with my uncle and aunt. This cruise is happening a week after my boyfriend’s internship ends after him working the whole summer, so we thought why not book a trip? We booked a trip to Europe from August 15-22. My mom is leaving August 18-20 (only 3 days!!) 

I booked this trip last month and didn’t mention it to her because my bf and I also went to Europe last summer for 3.5 weeks and had a great time. I randomly told her today because it came up in conversation and she flipped out. She told me to start saving up $$$ to move out, said I’m extremely disrespectful for not telling her around of time, and to cancel my trip or to get my money back somehow. Important to note that my mom is very strict and has been all my life, but as of the last few years she has been a little better. She still has her moments. 

I obviously am extremely upset and don’t know what to do if I’m the bad guy in this situation. She is mainly upset because now, my brother (15) and my sister (18) are going to need to have someone to watch them for that weekend since I won’t be here. Her and my dad divorced years ago and she doesn’t want my dad to “babysit” my siblings because she hates him…

I don’t know if I’m AITA in this situation for not telling her, but I don’t want to live my life based on who’s babysitting my siblings and I’m also turning 21 in a few weeks and the trip is fully paid for on my own, all I did was book it the same weekend she’s leaving because that’s when my boyfriends summer internship ends

"title: AITA for not thanks my parents enough?
content: TL;DR: I spend just a few word to thanks my parents at the end of my thesis because i was tired of writing, I'm private about my feelings especially with my family, and I don't like that everyone can read it (professors included). My mom said she is disappointed about it. AITA?


I'm graduating from medical school. In my country at the end of university you have to write a thesis about a subject and speak about it in front of professors, family and friends.

At the end of the thesis usually we spend some words to thanks professors, family and friends. 
I'm pretty private about my feelings and I don't like to write down too much information about my private life, especially considering that my professors/friends/collegues from university can (and probably will) read acknowledgements. I keep it simple, thanked my professors in a more formal way and then my closest friend and a couple of my class mates. Then I thanked my parents with a couple words, and my boyfriend. Something simple like ""a special thanks goes to my parents who always supported my trough this years"". Same for my BF and he's totally fine with it.

My parents knew that after writing something like 130 pages of thesis I was tired and I write acknowledgements only because ""I had to"". 

But today my mom read it and she said to me that she is disappointed, that since I thanked my classmates I could spend more words for my parents. 
This made me feel guilty and all the stress that I'm feeling a week before my graduation came out. I started crying and got angry at her, not because she ""said it"" but because considering that she knew everything, she know that I'm exhausted and stressed about everything that is going on, she didn't even have to feel that way.

I know that some people write down even 3 or 4 pages of acknowledgements, write things like ""to my family i love you you are an example to me, you are all my life etc"" but this is something that i find a bit cringe especially since my professors will probably read it and I don't find it appropriate from my POV.

Now I'm feeling embarrassed about my acknowledgements and I'm feeling guilty.

"title: AITA for not visiting sick family meme er because of other family member
content: Going to try to condense the story. So my grandparent (P) has been on palliative care for upwards of 3 years. They were recently hospitalized after coming off of palliative care due to the request of another family member (S). P has been vocal that I am to make all medical decisions, but healthcare providers have decided that P is no longer able to sign over a medical POA due to their mental capacity (lucid at times, but usually pretty out if it). 
Post hospitalization, P was transferred to a facility and the decision was made between myself & P that this facility would become their permanent residence. S has been living with P for a few years, but P is the renter and the apartment complex is 55+ (S is not 55+). Therefore, when P leaves, S needs to find their own place to live. S has done a pretty awful job of caring for P over the last few years (leaving them home alone for hours, withholding pain medication, forgetting about appointments, etc). This was part of the reason it was decided for them to stay in the facility. 
Well, S decided to convince P to go home & they would care for P full time. P is no longer able to walk alone, toilet alone, and even has difficulty turning themself in bed. With that being said, S, who has no other medical experience, says they’ll be there 24/7 providing care. I said if this happened, I was no longer making decisions or being involved in their care. No more free medical advice (I’m a RN). 
I spoke with P about coming home & they said they hadn’t decided, but S arranged for them to come home anyway. S has been at the facility at the time that I normally get there until 9/10pm because they don’t want me going to visit P and talk them out of going home. 
S can be fairly aggressive at times & I’m uncomfortable being around him & I’m definitely not comfortable with him caring for P, but I work 7-5 M-F & every other weekend, so I’m limited in what I’m able to do in terms of caring for P. Social workers, doctors, and hospice have been involved & are allowing P to go home under the impression that S is able to provide the care P needs (which they have been told isn’t the case). 
I’m at a loss. P knows my feelings towards S & understands, but he doesn’t know how afraid I am of S. AITA for not taking legal action against S for endangerment and not wanting to even go visit P when S is present?",nta
"title: AITA for not waking my girlfriend up from her nap?
content: My gf was very tired and decided to take a nap the moment she got home from work. She said she was going to make her lunch before she went off. I decided to play video games while she was napping.

About an hour later, I heard her alarm go off. I walked into the room and she told me it was okay and she put her alarm on snooze. 10 minutes later her alarm went off again and she put it on snooze. This would happen for about an hour (so the alarm went off 6 times).

My gf woke up and was very upset with me for letting her sleep for so long. I apologized but I told her that I thought she had set those alarms to wake herself up. Turns out the alarms were reminders for her to take her medication. She then started asking me a series of questions: How long were you going to let me sleep for? Why was I playing video games for so long? Why didn't I take a moment to think about what she might have needed me to do if she was napping? Why didn't I pack her lunch for her if she was asleep for so long? If I tried to wake her up the first time, why didn't I try to wake her up the other times the alarm went off?

Initially I was apologetic for having not woken her up, but I started to become upset with her because her line of questioning made me feel as though it was all my fault when really (in my opinion) the person responsible for her waking up is herself. I kept my lip shut and she continued to  excoriate me and telling me how it makes her feel sad that I don't anticipate her needs for her in advance. This also upset me too because it sounded as though she was saying to me ""hey why don't you read my mind more often?""

She asked me if I was mad at her and I told her I was. She asked me if I wanted to talk about it and I told her i'd discuss it with her tomorrow when I could get my thoughts in order and so I don't say something I would regret. She didn't like this but accepted it. It was at this point that she recognized that she may have been a bit unfair with blaming me for her not waking up, but she was still grumpy.

I've since calmed down by the matter, but I believe she is still not happy with me.

"title: AITA for not wanted to do my makeup the way my mom wants to for my quince?
content: So I 14F am having a Quince this September and I am a goth. I do the white foundation and black lipstick/eyeliner and I listen to goth music. Now I also listen to rock/metal too. My mom is the person who showed me all the rock/metal songs and bands and I recently started getting into the Goth Subculture. At first my mom loved that I was doing the big eyeliner and the black lipstick, but once I started doing the white foundation she started asking me to do my makeup “cute”. The first time she said it I was taken a back a little and told her that I do, do my makeup cute. And today we were walking this hill - we’ve been working out recently - and when we left we started to talk about my quince. Then she asked “can you just not do the white face?” And I said “No because that’s a big part of my makeup and (most of the time) the main thing about Tradition goth makeup.” And she kept going on about how it’s just for one day and it’s a really big celebration. I used her point and told her that it is in-fact a big celebration and it’s for me. I should be able to do my makeup the way I want to for my quince. And now she said that I probably won’t even get one because I don’t deserve one. AITA?


EDIT: I have been into the gothic look since I was in elementary. As I said i recently started getting into the actual subculture and listening to the music. I’ve always been a bit more on the dark side and always did my makeup darker. Her and I have been arguing a lot recently over the tiniest things.

He started talking about a hiking trip that he was going to take in May ever since then and I never really asked about it because I didn’t really care. We started talking a lot this past month and are dating now. His trip is coming up soon and I asked him who he was going with and he says “one of my ex’s”. Then he starts saying how he’s going to tell her about us because she always wants to know who he’s dating and he’s never told her before about anyone but he wants to tell her about me.

He makes me feel very secure in the relationship and I never doubt his feelings or intentions towards me.

In my heart of hearts, I don’t think anything will happen between them but I can’t help but feel a little bothered. 

I think it’s unfair of me to bring it up because this trip was planned before anything between us happened.

"title: AITA for not wanting my disabled sister at my wedding?
content: The title sounds awful but please read all the way til the end. DO NOT SPEED READ THIS. 

My (22f)  sister ""Anna"" (21) is ""special need"". She has severe autism and while she is verbal most of her communication is ""physical"" like sign language  due to her social discomfort. She does speak around family though and has pretty bad cognitive skills. She can't comprehend boundaries and lives with our parents so they can best watch her. 

I am getting married in 3 months. We planned a simple wedding and reception at my fiance ""Michael's"" parents barn and farm. Since it's all gonna be DIY and we aren't planning anything too expensive,  we can do things pretty quickly since flowers, food and decor will be provided by his family. 

I sent out invites last week and I asked that Anna not come. I told my parents I understood that would mean they may not show up but it was just a heads up. Why no Anna? She has an issue with touching Michael and trying to kiss him. At times when we were at my parents house Anna would try and grab Michael's hands, try to lean in to kiss him or would have a really bad shutdowns if she wasn't allowed to be directly next to him. We've tried speaking to her but there's only so much we can do when she doesn't really understand. I told my parents I just want one day for Michael to be *my* partner and not Anna's comfort person. They called me selfish and asked how I expected them to agree to something like this. They told me Anna is disabled and may never experience a wedding of her own and while I have Michael for probably the rest of our lives she'll have no one and that Michael and I can be a little more understanding to the reality of her life. 

I feel like a total ass and what they're saying has really gotten to me and I'm starting to question my decision.  AITA?

Update: My parents called me letting me know they won't be coming and that it's best I don't bring Michael around anymore since I've ""chosen some man over my sister"". They told me that Anna wanting to kiss Michael and hug him is normal for a women her age and that she doesn't understand what her feelings mean. I suggested they try to redirect her during the wedding but they said Michael is gonna be family to her and he needs to ""get over it"". I suggested they watch the wedding via web and they said that's not fair and that they deserve to see things in person. I asked if *I* could pay for someone with proper credentials to watch her that day while they attention and they asked what I would do when they died and if I'd pawn her off every time. I dropped the unfortunate truth bomb that I don't want to put any more of my life aside for Anna anymore. I did it up until I turned 18. And that Anna is not my life's responsibility and I won't be her keeper. I assured them I'd pay for her care but if she's okay doing this to Michael then I worry for if I ever do choose to have children and what she'd do to them 
 They said I was sick for suggesting she'd do anything to my future children and hung up on me. They sent a lengthy text telling me not to contact them until I could ""do the right thing"".  So thts where we are right now.

PLEASE READ: This is NOT an excuse to talk badly about disabled people's nor is this an opportunity to air out your hatred for them. My sister is not a scapegoat to hate disabled people. She is a human being with feelings, she is not a statistic, she is not evil. Please stop treating my sister as if she's a malicious monster, this debacle is between me and my parents. Leave her out of it, please. I am begging you, I don't want to hear why you think my sister sucks.",nta

"title: AITA for not wanting my mom’s friends to talk to me at home?
content: I’m an adult well into my 20s temporarily living at my parents home. My mom regularly has friends over who I’m constantly trying to dodge. I don’t like my mom nor her friends — they constantly grill me about my career plans and romantic relationships, and give me unsolicited, patronizing advice. I’ve never had any type of relationship with them outside of these abrasive interactions. 

When they’re there while I’m home, I make myself scarce but that is not always realistic. Sometimes I have to leave or I’m walking in from being out. So whenever I’m in their sight, I avoid eye contact, turn my back away from them, and dart fast. Sometimes I even wear headphones. I make it very obvious that I’m preoccupied or in a rush. Despite this, they are constantly trying to get my attention to talk, and if I don’t notice or ignore, they keep at it (i.e., “hiiii”,“helloooo” over and over again). I get that they’re trying to be friendly but they need to read the room!

I don’t get why they’re so persistent to talk to me when they’re not there to see me. I don’t even want to be living with my parents as an adult, let alone entertain their friends. I know I come off as rude by avoiding them, but isn’t it also rude to ignore social cues?

I usually spend my week in my uni apartment, this month due to various reasons I stayed at home with my parents full time.

Last weekend I stayed at my grandparents (dad's side) and came back home this morning. Tomorrow I'm going back to my uni and I have to leave at 6 AM. So today I had planned to pack my things, wash my hair (it takes up to 2 hours so it's basically an appointment), change the water of my fish tank, briefly meet my boyfriend and relax.

Just 2 hours prior her supposed arrival, my mother announced my cousin (26F) staying here up until tomorrow morning. 

The exact same thing happened less than 2 weeks ago, that time with the husband of another cousin of my mother, with whom I rarely talk to.

Today I'm really pissed off. I told my mother that it would be nice not having people showing up last minute and, had I known it, I would've stayed at my grandparents. We were both angry at this point and she answered that it's a pleasure for her, so I said that's the case JUST for her and she doesn't live alone.

Now I have to rearrange all of my errands because I can't leave my cousin alone (my parents are going to work).

I'm quite irritated now, my mother as well.

So, am I the hasshole here because I don't like when people, relatives or not, show up with only my mother knowing?

ETA: I'm not from the US, in my country it's normal to live with one's parents (without paying rent) while still being a student, sometimes even when first being employed, because it's really hard here to live on your own.
Also, in my culture, my parents' house is my own house as well. Meaning I have same rights and duties over it.

ETA 2: meaning, I'm required to take care of our guests and entertain them. It is considered disrespectful not to do so. My own needs come after the guest needs.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl
content: I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.

She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.

My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.

We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’

Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’

My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?

Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.

jess also says hi to everyone - and thanks you for looking out for her.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting my parents to stay with me when they visit?
content: I (26, F) am a PhD student in the Midwest and I live with another 26/F PhD student. My roommate and I will be moving to a new apartment in August. We will have one spare bedroom that we will be using as a study, a bedroom apiece and one bathroom that we will share. It's a pretty small apartment overall - we're keeping a study because our bedrooms would be super cramped with desks in them.

Now my Indian parents (I mention this bc maybe it'll help with setting the tone for cultural expectations) want to visit me in August right after I move into the new apartment. Usually having my parents come visit me has been a stressful experience - they tend to criticize whatever city I live in, my apartment or my work, and I prefer to visit them whenever possible to keep them out of my space. Not to mention that certain aspects of my lifestyle would not sit well with them, ie. my drinking and going out/working late. The last time they visited me was during COVID so they stayed in an Airbnb. This time they want to stay with me in my apartment, which I absolutely don't want. Between my roommate and I, we have very limited space. If they stayed in the study, they would be in our working space all the time, and all four of us would be using 1 bathroom. In my previous city, my roommate's super conservative mom visited and stayed for several weeks, and it was an inconvenience to me since we were sharing a bathroom, and I felt like I couldn't really do anything because she was constantly around. 

I don't want to impose on my roommate the way my old one did on me, and so I told my parents that I would prefer that they get a hotel room in town. I explained to them the logistics of the situation. They were upset at first when I told them I wasn't comfortable with them staying, and compared me to a cousin who let us stay with her and her roommates for a month in Singapore while we were visiting. In that situation, my cousin had her own bathroom, and a much larger apartment and a fixed 9-5 schedule. I also sort of hinted to my parents that we might get a third roommate and so we might not even have a spare room for them to stay in.

AITA for not letting my parents stay with me, even though we technically have the space?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting my sister’s boyfriend to move in with us?
content: I bought a house with my sister, which we both live in and rent out a 3rd room to our friend. My sister’s boyfriend’s tenancy is coming up and she wants him to move in for 3 months. After this they might go and travel but haven’t made any concrete plans (I think it will end up being longer than 3 months). My housemate and I get on with him fine but really don’t want him to move in for a few reasons:

1. I don’t think the house is big enough for 4 people. One bathroom and the kitchen is quite small
2. I don’t want to live with a couple. The house dynamic will change 
3. Our flatmate will probably move out as she’s also not happy for the reasons listed above. 

Although it’s my sister’s house too we moved in together without any talk of her boyfriend moving in. We agreed it was going to be us plus a lodger. 

I do understand her point of view and that she wants to help her boyfriend out/it would be nice for them to live together but I don’t think she gets how this will change the whole house dynamic. I’ve told her how I feel and she still doesn’t understand the problem so will probably go ahead with it. I don’t know what else to say and I do feel bad for making a fuss and don’t want to fall out over it. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting spider egg contaminated brush in the kitchen sink?
content: My(30F) fiance(32M) decided to do a deep clean around a garden doors, where we keep a cat litter box.

He used a bottle brush to clean away a big spider and it's eggs form a door frame. I asked him to make sure that brush doesn't go back in to the kitchen sink.

Few hours later the brush is in the sink, in the compartment with my wooden chopsticks I hold dearly as he gave them to me for my 30th birthday just few days ago.

We argued, he kept brining my dirty habits (like placing my vapes on a table surface that is being walk over by cats) and calling me a hypocrite. I explained that since we both don't clean a raw chicken in the sink cuz it's spreads pathogens then following that logic a brush used to clean away spider eggs in the area of cat litter box shouldn't be cleaned in the kitchen sink as well. I didn't bring any other things in to the argument yet he called me out on talking about chicken like as if I accused him of doing that. I explained I didn't and just used it to show the logic in my ask. I also brought up that why is he ok with other people being afraid of spiders but can't understand that I'm feeling disgusted on a thought of putting wooden untencils up my mouth that touched a brush used to clean of spider eggs in cat litter box area.


He didn't admit his fault. His only arguments were my other bad habits and calling me a hypocrite.


He cleaned the chopsticks. I explained that it doesn't matter now, I'm still going to be too disguised to use them.


I told him he should have washed the brush with bleach in a bathtub and clean the bathtub afterwards if he intended to keep it for general, not food related, cleaning purposes or throw it away. He chucked it away. I'm writing this.


Who is the A hole? Me for trying to prevent that brush being in the sink and being upset after it landed there even tho I have other dirty habits or him for not respecting my ask and being angry at my for pointing it out? I'm neurodiverent and have a whole routine around cleaning dishes and prefer to do it myself.


We were both angry but I was acting more upset and my voice was much more raised.",yta

"title: AITA for not wanting to be my former best friend's Best Man? (34M)
content: For context, this friend and I were pretty close growing up, particularly through middle and early high school. We would have overnighters every weekend and it wasn't unusual for us to spend almost the entire summer together. However, during our late high school to early college years, we began to drift apart. We still saw each other but it was never really the same. I probably would have stopped calling him my best friend in Junior year of college, he became more of just an acquaintance at that point. After college, he spent the next several years travelling the world and stopped talking to all of his old HS/MS buddies. I tried to reach out several times but just got nothing in return. Fine, that's just how things happen I guess. Obviously I was upset but eventually moved on and made more/better friends and entered into relationships of my own. 

Well, 3-4 years ago at this point, this friend decided he wanted to reconnect with some of his old HS/MS buddies. He invited us to dinner, and it just felt super awkward. Despite travelling the world for literal years, it turns out that he really hasn't changed at all since High School personality-wise. I just felt like we had nothing in common anymore - politically, life goals , etc. He is obsessed with work (he works as an accountant, if that matters) and doesn't really seem to have any hobbies outside of work and watching old movies (literally, he hasn't seen a single movie made after like 2005 lol.) This makes conversation kind of difficult since I am pretty much the complete opposite. I've tried to get him to try out some of my hobbies but that hasn't worked at all. He is extremely closeminded about stuff he hasn't tried and is one of the most stubborn people I've ever met. We still get dinner once in a blue moon (2-3x a year, he always initiates) but that is it. I have a pretty big friend group and a fiancée of my own already so I'm not exactly desperate for interaction with someone I don't get along with anymore. 

With the above being true, I guess it's not too much of a surprise that he doesn't really have any friends outside of me. Thus, a few weeks ago, he asked me to be his best man at his wedding. I was a little taken aback - I did not expect to be asked to be a best man for someone I barely talk to anymore. I ended up saying no, which he seemed fine with at the time. His mother was not, though. I wouldn't care otherwise but my parents and his are still really good friends (cocktails every few weeks, etc.) Now my parents are furious at me - calling me an ungrateful POS, etc. 

TLDR - Former best friend stops contacting me for years, eventually reconnects but is awkward, doesn't really have any friends so he turns to me to be his best man despite us not really connecting at all anymore. AITA for refusing? 

Also, I know this isn't r/advice, but any tips for how to calm my parents down would be appreciated.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to be woke up in the middle of the night to make my husband food or rub him?
content: Lately, my husband has been waking me up between 1 am. and 3 am. because he is hungry or wants a rub. (Back or arm) I hate being woken up when I am sleeping.  Last time, he woke me up by poking me until I woke up. It's not hard, just insistent. I hate being woken up when I am deep asleep. 

 I told him he needs to not make a habit of it because if he wants a snack in the middle of the night he can get it himself and if he wanted a rub he should have asked before we went to bed. 

He thinks I am the asshole because l don't drive, and he has to wake up to bring me to work every day Monday through Friday at around 7:15 am.  

 I tried to say waking up after 8 full hours is different than being woke up in the middle of the night.   I can usually fall back asleep fast after, but sometimes, like tonight, I have trouble. He said it's because his back hurts etc. He wants a rub to fall back asleep but didn't tell me that until tonight. I also sometimes wake him up snoring. 

AITA for not wanting to wake up in the middle of the night to make him a snack or give him a rub when he has to wake up to take me to work in the morning? 


I feel like I am the asshole  because I didn't know it was because his back hurt and to help him fall back asleep. But at the same time he is a grown man and can get his own midnight snack. 


I can answer questions tomorrow or I guess today since it's now 4 am. Also on mobile so forgive any spelling or grammar issues.


Edit: Thanks, everyone. I am going to keep telling him no. This just started about a week ago, and I didn't do it every time.  last night,  he wanted me to microwave his leftovers at 3 a,  and I did it just so he would stop saying he was hungry. I'm going to stick to telling him no and not do it.

Edit 2: I get panic attacks when I drive. I am thinking of getting lessons at a driving school, but it's hard when they are so expensive, and I am not sure how they would deal with the panic attacks.

Edit 3: he is not a cat. Thanks everyone. I was standing my ground about not doing it and I wanted to make sure I was right. It's good to know so many agree with me. Chances are he will try again and when I say no he will stop. Or will stop now that we had the argument about it. I don't plan on giving in to him being childish about this.

This year she asked for her birthday a pair of AirPods and she lost them in less than a month, she had also lost 4 other pairs of wireless earphones in the timespan of 3 months. I then asked her why she didn’t want to spend her own savings for them and she answered that she’d loose them so she didn’t want to spend hers.

"title: AITA for not wanting to celebrate my mom on MY birthday?
content: I have three siblings between the ages of 10 and 18. I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.

Every year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.

I asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.

I thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/

EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to! If you'd feel inclined, I think it would be pretty cool to donate it instead to a cool charity of your choice instead.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to do all of the chores at home
content: I'm in my early twenties and I'm living at home with my parents while simultaneously going to uni and working from home. Both parents are working full time. 

Recently got into an argument with them over me telling them that I can't do all of the chores because I don't have enough time for that. Here's an example of how they imagine my day should go: I wake up early and go to classes, after, I return home and do all of the cleaning that needs to be done while somehow working at the same time. This seems ridiculous especially since I never leave my room unless I need to eat/take a shower. They litter the house, yet expect me to do everything because ""I'm home"". I don't think it's fair to expect one person to clean everyone's mess because they work from home.

It all started because I told one of them that we're running low on milk and asked (since I knew they were going to go get groceries that day) if they could get some. Suddenly I get told how I'm the one who's going to do that and no matter how much I explained that I'm working that day and I can't leave my pc they wouldn't listen. It's really frustrating since I work on weekends as well and it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask them to do the groceries when they are home watching tv and I'm working. AITA?",yta

She then asked me if I can be willing to do that for her to pick her up and take her home after. 

She explained she hardly has family or friends close to take her and  that it doesn't fit with anyone's schedule in the work place cause me and her work the same hours

She got mad at me and told me she's a mother of 2 kids and can't give me gas money, I told her then that I'm a very busy person but she got mad and said I shouldn't be because I don't have kids of my own so I don't understand her situation and then she's been distant the rest of the day and got a family member to pick her up.

"title: AITA for not wanting to get rid of my roommates as per wife’s demands.
content: Okay backstory time, I (m/34) and my wife (f/34) will have been married for three years this upcoming December. I own a two family house on an acre in central jersey that I purchased when I was 25. I rent out one side and live in the other, I have two spare bedrooms that I also sublet, one to a dear friend of mine (m/35) and another to my cousin (f/35). I have always rented these rooms and having the extra income between the rental side and the rooms I rent on my side means the house basically pays for itself mortgage wise. I have to come out of pocket for utilities such as garbage, electricity, fuel oil etc etc. 

My monthly cost of living is anywhere from 600-800 bucks handling the aforementioned bills. Relatively cheap for New Jersey where a two bedroom apartment can run you 2500 bucks. So now to the issue at hand my wife wants to get rid of our roommates…. As of now she lives for free absolutely 0 cost of living, which has helped her significantly regarding paying down debts, fixing her credit and so on, she’s not out of the woods yet but she’s well on her way, I’d say in about another year or so she’ll be 100% debt free. 

She has expressed in the past that she would like to live alone but at the time it just wasn’t economically feasible for us to do so (she wasn’t working, then Covid happened, blah blah blah) no big deal right ? Also I should mention you wouldn’t even know we have roommates, sometimes I go days without bumping into one of them. 

Anyways this week she slaps me with an ultimatum out of the blue that either the Roomate’s move out or she’s going to leave me, I stated that I did not think that was the smartest financial move as she only wants to give them 30days which would means we would be looking at having to come up with 1600 bucks the following month. Queue argument. 

She states she can afford to make up the difference, and that paying it would be worth being able to live alone together. Am I the asshole for thinking this is stupid, that giving up almost 20k a year in rental income on the drop of a dime doesn’t make any sense, not to mention telling a friend of 22 years as well as my cousin sorry guys the wife’s giving ya 30days notice good luck 👍🏻…. 

Furthermore this income allows us to travel whenever we want, buy whatever we want, go out whenever we want. It basically helps make us very flexible financially. Also why can’t we compromise ? Okay you want them gone, let’s stick it out out for one more year, knock out the rest of your debt and also give the roomies plenty of notice that this is what we are going to pursue. 

TLDR: wife wants Roomate’s gone, husband thinks it’s stupid because “money”. Wife threatens to leave, husband still thinks getting rid of rental income is stupid but offers compromise. Wife will not compromise. Is he the asshole",yta
"title: AITA for not wanting to give our spare tire to a random family who got a flat outside our house?
content:  My (36f) and my husband (37m) live on a major thoroughfare in our neighborhood. Husband and I get by okay, but we are by no means well-off.

Today, about 3 pm, a family (dad, mom, three little kids) get a flat tire on our side of the street, a bit down from where our house actually is. They call the police, and the police help them push their car to a parking spot on the street in front of my neighbor's house. When they got the flat, I thought, ""Ah, that sucks, but it happens to the best of us, and hopefully they get help soon.""

Flash-forward to a few hours later. My neighbor has been entertaining/feeding the mom and kids since the flat happened. The dad has been dealing with the flat. Husband goes to take out recycling, and the dad asks him if he has an iPhone charger. Husband gives him the iPhone charger from his car, nbd, and asks for it back when the dad is done using it.

Six hours into the ordeal, the family is not any closer to getting home. The solution they've come up with is to ask Husband if they can have the donut from his car because they were driving on their donut, and it went totally flat. The full-sized tire they had that went flat last week is in their trunk. Husband says yes almost immediately (he hates saying no), then comes up to tell me what happened and that he doesn't really want to give them his spare tire because he doesn't think it'll fit, and that he's concerned about getting it back (he did get the dad's number). I tell him to tell the dad what he just told me, and he says that it feels unethical because he wouldn't want someone to do him like that if he was in the same situation. I ask what he would do if he was in the dad's situation, and he says that he'd call AAA. I tell him that I'll go deliver the news to the dad, and he says that he'll do it because otherwise it'll look like he sent his wife to do his dirty work.

Moments later, Husband is trying to get his spare onto the dad's wheel. It doesn't fit. Husband comes back up to the house, and we talk about it a bit. I tell him that I don't think he needed to offer his donut at all, and he says that he guesses we're just ""wired differently"" because he can’t say no to someone in that situation without a good reason. I tell him that ""I don't want to do this"" is a perfectly valid reason. I say there are other ways he can help besides giving them his spare tire, and he says, ""Like what? That wouldn't cost money?"" and, tbh, every aid I was going to offer (calling AAA, calling a Lyft for the family to get home, etc) would involve some amount of money, but not necessarily the same amount of money/hassle as a new spare tire would cost.

He's saying that I'm heartless for not offering everything I can to these strangers who happened to get a flat on our street. I say it's not our responsibility and that the fact that they're soliciting aid doesn't mean that we're compelled to give it in whatever form they ask. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to go on a bachelorette trip?
content: Some context: I’ve had the same 5 girl friends since middle school and we’re all almost 24.

We found a group of guys in high school and some of us are dating now, and we’ve all been friends for 7-8 years. One of the couples is getting married (her fiancè ass*ulted me for 2 years at parties, we all know this and have “moved on”) and the remaining 5 of us are her bridesmaids. One friend absolutely hates her boyfriend (controlling and abusive to each other), so she is eager to get us together and do girls nights. She would see us 5 days a week if she could and never spends a weekend night alone with her boyfriend, they constantly ask everyone to go out. On NYE, we went to her party and got there first at 8, and left at 11:30 to go hang with my cousins (bf worked at 6am that day). She apparently talked shit about us for months and couldn’t BELIEVE we left without telling her about the other party in advance. “Why didn’t you just go there first, we’re who you want to be with more” 

We’ve all kinda grown apart a bit, me especially, since being with my boyfriend who is so wonderful that I’ve realized their negative qualities. He doesn’t put this in my head, instead we spend our time together laughing and enjoying each other’s presence rather than talking shit about people from high school like our friends do. All they do is drink and tell the same stories, and we recently stopped drinking.

Most recently, 3 of the 5 girls all ganged up and attacked me for not coming out that often. I am the last one still in school (FT) and I work 5 days a week, and sometimes I get depressed. I had plans with a friend from college moving this one weekend, and they accused me of lying and bombarded me and said I need to go to the doctor for depression and that it’s really strange that I never want to go out. It made me really upset at first but then angry and now I don’t care. I’m busy and I had plans this ONE day.

So, all the girls are going on a bachelorette trip (flying) and I’m the odd one out because I don’t really want to go (they don’t know this obviously and genuinely never could consider it possible). They’re planning on staying out until 4am and going clubbing, and I don’t drink. I’ll be in summer classes and have finals around the weekend they’re going, so another reason I’m against it. 

They do not take no for an answer, and are obsessed with each other so they cannot possibly imagine why I WOULDN’T want to stand at a club sober until 4am if I’m with them! I definitely could make it work, but I really don’t want to and need to pay off my loans and worry about school. My bf always jokes “you’re gonna be in so much trouble if you don’t go,” because honestly, they won’t let me live it down but I’m not worried about missing out on anything or blowing $500 (+$130 on the dress not including color-coordinated outfits and bathing suits I’d need to buy) just to get there. I’m the only one who hasn’t bought a plane ticket or paid for the airbnb and I don’t even think the bride knows that yet. AITA?

ETA: I believe and know in my heart that (most of) my friends are not malicious people, but are simply too obsessed and caught up with keeping us together. A few of them have some tough families and clearly project and do all that they can to keep us close. They always backpedal and say they say these things to me “just because they want to see me,” like I know that, but it pushes me away. 

You have all been very kind. I know the situation I’m in and don’t even text in the group chat (all they do is send instagram posts and say wow she’s fat now) and have been shit-talked about for even that, lol. I am distanced from them in a way they despise, and I intend to keep it that way. Small doses is what I prefer.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to go to a summer military program that’ll require me to buzz my hair?
content: Ive been doing a program at my school which is called “the marine challenge” which is basically a fitness program. My parents asked if I wanted to do a program at Marine Military Academy over the summer and I said sure, thinking it was more of the same.

But I looked up videos of it, and while it seems fun, they make all campers buzz their hair off. I have long hair right now. I told my mom I changed my mind but she said she already put down the deposit and I am going. She asked why I didn’t want to go and I said I didn’t know they’d be shaving my head. She said it’s just a haircut, and it’s selfish to now back out and that I should have looked it up before saying yes.

"title: AITA for not wanting to go to my friends’ party?
content: My (21F) two best friends (both 20F and twins) are planning on throwing an end-of-year party to celebrate the school year coming to a close. They made it clear from the beginning that they wanted it to be a small event and just invite most of our friend group (think ~15 people). However, when I found out that they were planning on inviting my ex (21M), I was not so happy.

Me and my ex met through my two best friends and our relationship was not pretty. We dated for about 2 years filled with constant fights and arguments and almost-breakups. He would constantly make snide comments that he claimed were ‘just jokes’ about men being “superior to women”. He also claimed to not support gay people while fully knowing that I am pansexual. The twins (my best friends) also grew to hate ex during our relationship and would get into arguments with him almost any time there was a mutual hangout.

After our breakup, the twins actually started warming up to ex again despite previously claiming to not like him and encouraging me to break up with him. This was a little strange to me but I decided not to make any comments about it. They can be friends with whoever they want to be friends with, even if I did feel a little let down (I have been best friends with these two people since 4th grade). 

So about a week ago, they announced their party idea and made it perfectly clear that they were planning on inviting ex. Again, I was a little irked but didn’t want to make a big deal. They are allowed to invite who they want to invite, despite almost every person in our friend group not liking ex. But just as they were allowed to invite ex, I felt that I was allowed to not want to attend the party. Now, it would be one thing if this was a huge party with 100+ people and I wouldn’t even see ex, but this was a small party where we would most likely be forced to interact at some point. I did not feel comfortable with this, but I also did not want to be the bossy friend who tried to control what the twins did, so I simply told them that I would probably not be attending.

This, apparently, was the wrong move. They immediately became annoyed with me and told me that I was being dramatic and that I needed to “get over it.” They told me that they could invite whoever they wanted and that it wasn’t a big deal. Now, a reminder: this was a two-year relationship that ended not 3 months prior and did not end prettily. I honestly felt shocked that they would say something like that to me and I was really hurt. 

I’m a little conflicted. I don’t want to fight with my best friends but I also really don’t want to hang out with ex. Should I suck it up and go to the party to please the twins or should I keep my position of non-attendance?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to golf with a guy who brought his dog
content: Me and a friend are regular golfing buddies. He had a friend in town that was going to come with us. We went to a nicer course. We had booked our three spots weeks in advance (because you need to at this type of course) and left a single open to complete the foursome.

Day comes to golf. My friend and his buddy are riding the cart together and so I’d be stuck with the random if there is one.

Well there was one. I had loaded my clubs in the cart. Next thing I know I have a dog sniffing my ankles. I step away from it shocked and just kinda react WTF. The guy laughs, loads his clubs and goes “oh sorry didn’t mean to scare you, that’s bear, he is coming out with us hope you don’t mind?”

Well I did mind and wasn’t about to golf with a dog present and told him so. He seemed kind of shocked I said no. I don’t care for dogs and definitely don’t want one around for one of my favorite activities. I go to the attendant and ask if I can have my own cart. I’m told no. They don’t have any to spare especially considering they are sold out except for some late in the day tee times. I ask if dogs are allowed, the attendant says no but also says we aren’t allowed to say no to patrons because of an incident that got confrontational before.

I go back and ask the guy if he can leave his dog or take it home. He says no and that he lives too far away and would miss a few holes. I’m getting visibly more frustrated. He says he didn’t think it’d be an issue bringing his dog. I tell him not to assume that type of thing. I unload my clubs, tell my buddy and his friend I’m not golfing with this guy and leave.

"title: AITA for not wanting to hangout with her friends?
content: So I 20F have recently met this girl 22F. I'm bi and she's a lesbian, not that it really matters for the story.

We've talked for a few weeks on social media before deciding to plan a date, the date could have happened sooner but we both had tight schedules (she's a nurse). Anyway, when I brought up the idea of seeing each other she immediately offered that I go to a barbecue party at her sister's with her friends and then we would go to the club. 

I explained that I wasn't especially comfortable with the idea of being alone in a group of total strangers. I also said that I wasn't extremely found of clubs especially when I don't know anyone. She understood but said it was reassuring for her as she has some autistic traits and doesn't feel great when not surrounded by people she knows.

We ended up grabbing a coffee, just the two of us yesterday and visiting a museum. I explained more thoroughly that I wasn't actually antisocial but I'm just this kind of girl that has her group of friends with which I like to hangout with, we sometimes go to the club when we feel like it but mostly do home parties.

We kept talking through messages she said she liked the date, I liked it too and asked her how was the party. She replied she loved it and once again proposed to go to the bar with her and her friends and then we would go to the club. I tried, as politely as possible, to answer that I wasn't extremely found of clubs and that I would rather do another coffee date or grab a drink just the two of us. I don't see why she wants to rush the presentations to friends and relatives. It is really overwhelming for me and I personally like getting to know any new SO before introducing them to my friends and eventually hangout all together.

I feel bad for refusing her propositions to hangout (though I already explained her that I'm working early in the morning and as I'm currently living with my parents whose house is quite far from the city, it is not so easy for me to go clubbing, moreover I don't want to sleep at a complete stranger's apartment, though she offered). 

Moreover, I'm afraid she is weirded out as I'm not the type of girl who posts a lot on social media, nor do I talk much about my friends and relatives, I'm overall quite private and she would have to wait a long long time before meeting any of them. Yet, I hate the situation of hanging out with just her friends and people she knows and who all know each other and being the odd +1.

"title: AITA for not wanting to hear my friend talk about the clubs
content: I (M23) have a best friend (F22) that I'll refer to as Sam. 

Sam likes to go to the clubs at least once a week, though she usually goes twice. This obviously doesn't bother me. She keeps trying to get me to go out because ""I'm her best friend"" but I've really decided to save money to plan for my future. I've been with her about a dozen times since she's turned 21, but I've really slowed down on drinking.

Anyway, I usually just stay home and write or play video games. The next day after she goes out, Sam wants to give me the whole rundown. I don't know if I'm being a jerk but I just do not care to hear about it. If she wants to tell me about how school is going, great. If she wants to talk to me about any issues she has, go for it. I'm just exhausted of the whole club thing in general.

Sam does have some problems with drinking too much and getting herself into some sticky situations, along with associating with the wrong crowd while going out.

I do want to mention that she met this guy at the club and became obsessed. To the point that when they broke up after a few months of hooking up and three weeks of dating, she constantly cries over him when she's drunk almost a year later.

I don't know if it's because of this or something else, but AITA and being a bad friend?

"title: AITA for not wanting to help my daughters mother with university payments.
content: I(19) have six months old twin girls with a woman named Evie(19). Evie is from the USA but has lived here since she was 17yrs old. Evie and I hate eachother so much that I'm surprised we even have babies together. (We were drunk). Evie attends the same top university as me, but her family are struggling with student fees  So she thought asking me for money(not a loan) would be ok . I told her no, and asking for that much money was rude.
Just to clarify, my sisters and I (triplets) inherited a ton of money when we were 16. We all use it to further our education and improve our lifestyle.(back to Evie). She went ballistic and called me a horrible father for not wanting to help the mother of my girls. Her family is constantly harassing me, saying I must help out their daughter. At the same time, they are hounding me to pay up just because it won't dent my bank account. My sisters tell me it's not my responsibility to help her and think she should drop out if money is the issue. I also don't believe that it should be my job to help with her education, even though it's technically accurate that it won't make a dent. The only reason I'm doubting myself is because she's my daughters mother.
Usually I would ignore these kinds of people, but it's impossible with these specific people. I want to say fuck off in their faces, but don't I'm not in the mood to stir up trouble. So AITA for refusing to pay a penny towards her university.

Sorry if this sounds rushed, I'm just sick.

I live in UK. We have child maintenance not child support. Parents who share equal custody (which we do) don't have to pay any child maintenance aslong as you children are provided for.

Update: I just want to make it clear that I offered Evie a loan but she refused it. She doesn't want any legal paper work attached to the money.

Update: If she took my children away to the USA for more than 28 days then my children have been abducted. UK law stands and other countries including USA have agreed.

Update: Evie will not go back to the USA. She's not that stupid to get in more legal trouble or that stupid to piss me off. I don't want to hate Evie but unless she changes for the better I can't stop hating her. Can she go to USA with our children. Yes. But am I actually going to let her life their with my kids. He'll no. She can live her fairy tale life for a year at most but at the end of the day she will be arrested. UK law wil not be ignored internationally. And she knows I'm more likely to hire someone to end her life then let her take kids. Am I that mentally insane. YES.",nta

"title: AITA for not wanting to host my cousin?
content: Before I start I want to apologise if I misspelled something, English is not my first language, so if something is not clear let me know in the comments, I’ll try to explain myself better.

Some context: I’ve never been close to any of my cousins, mostly because they’re all 10+ years older than me. The only exception are my uncle’s kids. My uncle’s daughter, C, is one year younger than me. When we were kids we had fun together, and she was my favourite cousin, however her mom didn’t want me to hang out with C, cause she wanted her daughter to be closer to her side of the family. She constantly complained how I shouldn’t be there (despite my uncle inviting me over his place). So, around the age of 6/7 I stopped hanging out with C. 

We didn’t have a relationship even when we were teens, and we started to use Facebook. I honestly didn’t care, cause by that time we didn’t have a relationship for years and I was struggling with depression, but this is just to say that we never had a relationship after that, even if it was possible.

In the latest 10 years we saw each other 4 or 5 times, during majors family events. Me and C usually chitchatted during those events, but nothing more. We don’t even have each other number or follow each other through social media (except Facebook, that we don’t actually use anymore). 

Now, I’ve moved in with my bf, in another city, after years of LDR. He lived in the other side of my country so it’s quite far from my family. 

In my country it’s very hard to find a job, but being the richest part of the country, here it’s easier to find a job, even better paid. 

Now, my aunt (C’s mother) asked me to host C for some months, so she can find a job and after that she would move out. She asked my mother who asked me. I told her no.

I know that it’s not C’s fault, and if there’s anyone to blame it’s my aunt, but me and my bf live in a small condo (1 bedroom and the living room), which is fine for us, and even for some occasional guest, like my friends, which never stay more than one week when they come to visit me, but it’s not ideal for 3 people. But more than that, I don’t want to host someone, who’s a complete stranger to me, for months. 

By bf isn’t crazy about the idea either, he doesn’t like having people he doesn’t know in his house, but said that if I really want to, I can host her for a couple months. 

After I said no, some relatives called me an AH and I guessing if I’m not punishing C for something that isn’t even her fault.

My GF and I  were in a tight spot and her mom had a 2007 Nissan Versa that had been sitting in her yard for about a year since she had bought a new vehicle. GFs mom said she had been trying to sell it for 3K, which when I checked KBB was way over the listing for a used 2007 Versa. But, because we were in a pickle she offered to sell it to us for 1.5K, she told us it ran great, A/C worked great, the only thing wrong with it was the driver window didnt roll down and it needed a new battery, which she would buy. (we ended up having to buy it)

We had been making payments to her, 200$ a paycheck, real easy like. First off, we noticed a few things: Both windows in the front did not roll down, AC.. does not work. CD player.. does not work. speaker is completely blown. OK whatever, it was January so we didnt need AC yet. But then, about two weeks after buying it, it started dying. took it in and found out the fuel pump was dead. 1400$ to fix the fuel pump.

"title: AITA for not wanting to pay undisclosed Bachelorette Party expenses?
content: Our best friend of 25 years is getting married. We are bridesmaids, and her two sisters are the Maids of Honor (MOHs).
The MOHs started organizing the Bachelorette weekend months ago. The guest list included the bridal party, and a bunch of the Bride's other girl friends. In total, there were 21 girls (I think) plus the Bride.

The Bride wanted a ""surprise cottage weekend"" and didn't know any of the details (e.g. location, activities) except for the dates in advance. She made it very clear that she did not want us to spend a ton of money on her. The Bachelorette weekend took place a couple weeks ago as a Friday-Sunday party in a large AirBnB chalet.

A few months ago, the MOHs asked us to etransfer $279 each for the weekend. We were also offered an optional spa day after checking out of the chalet, which we would have to pay for. No other discussion of expenses occurred. A bunch of us additionally bought and brought drinks, snacks, and supplies for games/activities (and we did not expect anyone to pay us back for those costs, of course).

After the Bachelorette weekend ended, the MOHs sent the entire group a bill, which outlined what everyone owed. We were shocked to find that around $300-400 was added for each guest.

We are some of the more financially stable members of the group, and are used to people trying to get us to pay for things we don't want... but we were appalled when we saw that all the other girls were given balances up to $760 that they never consented to in advance.

In our Bachelorette WhatsApp chat (the Bride is not in the chat, and doesn't know anything about this), we addressed how we were blindsided by the bill, as we never got the memo that we were expected to pay more than $279+spa services.

The MOHs offered to take a few expenses off of our individual bills, but our bills weren't even the issue really... the issue was the bills given to our other friends/the other girls (some of who we know aren't in a financial position to throw money around).

We think this whole thing is socially and financially irresponsible, and do not think that the girls should be paying the MOHs back for careless spending (e.g. adding expenses like $2000 for private chef, $1500 for bottle service, without first consulting the group or even informing them of the additional cost).

We paid the MOHs what we ""owed"" to avoid drama, and because we still love them as our best friend's little sisters. AWTA for calling them out in the group chat? We considered messaging the MOHs privately, but wanted the rest of the group to know how we feel, as we assume many of them feel the same way. We didn't want the girls to assume that everyone else was cool with the unexpected expenses, and grudgingly etransfer hundreds of dollars that they didn't agree to spend.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to play anymore?
content: I have a friend group with my wife where we play a lot of different games video, board, card.

I used to game competitively in my younger days and got paid to do so I understand my competitiveness is a bit more than others but I tend to try to take things easy in casual settings.

While playing in our group I’ve noticed that a lot of times I get teamed up on constantly, and isolated to where what we are doing becomes virtually just a huge struggle of bias and unfairness.

Mainly because the group actively goes out of their way to make things harder for me even if they don’t recognize it.

In smash our first time playing everyone 3 on 1 me damn near immediately. Even in other games where there are no teams constantly but yet everyone focuses on me first and it’s ridiculous.

What made me finally say fuck this was during monopoly (I know great friend game I have literally said I didn’t want to play but got asked so much I finally accepted) I could not even get my colors or any auctions because the group consistently only traded to each other and gave me complete shit trades.

It wouldn’t be so bad but they let house rules completely ruin auctioning to where no one was even having to blow money in a bid war they just aligned themselves and made it more difficult for my plays but they did not work against each other.

It got to the point where there was no point in playing any longer and I said I was out because it was completely unfair.

The situation turned into me being childish an asshole and getting cussed at.

My wife told me that it happens because I’m a “strong player” but what does that matter if I don’t even get to play fairly in any game we play. My wife also didn’t back me up in the situation and told me that there is no bias and it only happens when I’m winning when that’s entirely untrue as they do it it immediately in some games.

At this point I feel extremely alienated in a friend group and by my wife at a time that’s supposed to be leisure. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: every game I play with friends and wife turns into everyone just going out of their way immediately even in new games to make sure I’m getting screwed over due to a bias of being a “strong player” “and I usually win anyways” so I called them out and they cussed me out.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to share my daughter's birthday?
content: So I really don't think I'm TA here.

My (29F) sister (28F) lately has been taking it upon herself to organize family dinners for ""quality time"". She's newly married, so I don't know if it's a nesting thing or what.

Saturday is my daughter's birthday, and I organized a party for her. She's turning four, and I invited everyone.

My sister decided to organize a dinner right after the party for ""mother's day"" so she doesn't have to, in her own words, ""drive all that way twice"". She lives 30 mins away..

Anyway, she made the reservation. She told us. I said uh sorry no, that's my daughter's birthday, and even if her party is over at that time, we are going home and my daughter is going to enjoy her ENTIRE birthday. (She's four, so I'm sure she will want to go home and open all her new toys), and they don't need me there if they want to do their mother's day time with our mom the same day. 

I can see our mom on actual mother's day.

For some background they do this a lot. My sister's son (8M) gets the WHOLE family at his soccer games, but no one comes to my daughter's gymnastics. I made big plans for Easter, which included inviting them to an Easter Fair specific to kids with sensory issues. (My daughter is autistic). They showed up late, missed the entire hunt, and left after only a few minutes because everyone made plans for the zoo last minute, and then guilted ME for not wanting to go. They treat my daughter like being little and autistic means she's incapable of getting her feelings hurt or that shes not able to see when they're doing this.

She has babysat for me literally barely a handful of times. When her son was little I watched him CONSTANTLY while she went out. My in laws family knew him better than her in laws, because I was always forced to either bring him with me or cancel plans. She left me with him, after I said no, at my own bridal shower because she had a date (with her now husband).

Anyway, it turned into a HUGE argument with my family, my sister left the family group chat. I got called selfish by literally everyone. 

Apparently my sister was making some kind of announcement at this dinner, and her husband was busy on actual mother's day. 

I said, ""I don't care, pick a day that's not my kids birthday. I'm busy the WHOLE day, not just the length of the party.""

Noone is speaking to me now. And likely no one is coming to my daughter's birthday at all.



UPDATE:

Thank you everyone for all the support. It makes me feel a lot better, especially since the smear campaign is still ongoing.

I blocked the number of the main FM (my older brother, 40), cancelled the arcade reservation, and decided to take the few people who were coming to Knott's Berry Farm! The price shakes out to about the same, and I can contact their accessibility department for resources and guides for the special needs kids. I think this is going to go way better. My mom is ditching the mothers day dinner ""for her"" and coming with us because she said my daughter's birthday is more important than another mother's day, so I'm feeling really good about that. 

❤️



SECOND UPDATE:

Had my sister and nephew moved off my phone bill. She can pay for their service from now on. FM (brother) is still in his screeching, but both of them are blocked from contacting me. 

I feel sad that this limits her on family, but no family is better than a family that forces you to always take last place and tells you to be happy about it, I definitely know that. 

We are going to have a blast at Knott's, and special thank you's to the responses to my inbox from fellow neurospicy users with all the tips on making sure she has a great time there without getting overwhelmed!!! ❤️",nta

From years of familial trauma to my own need for reclusion in my free time (I have a moderately stressful job), I usually see my father once every 3 months and my mother once or twice per month. I speak to my mom daily and my dad 1-2 times per week via phone. This has been the norm for quite some time. 

For additional context, my father lives 2 hours from me and my mother lives 30 minutes away. My sister lives about 2.5 hours away.

Since my sister (32F) has gotten married in January, she has been driving to see my mom nearly every weekend and pressuring me to do the same. Her new husband sees his parents every weekend, so I assume that to be the cause.

My partner of five years works a demanding job and I usually reserve the weekends for our time together with our dog. Prior to that, I was in grad school full-time while simultaneously balancing a full-time job up until last December, so I did schoolwork all weekend for two years.

Nowadays, whenever my sister contacts me, it’s out of anger to tell me that I should be making more of an effort to be with my parents. I find spending time with my family to be pretty unbearable—my mother is emotionally unstable and my father is a narcissist. Plus, any time I take my mother out for special occasions she is rude to waitstaff and often complains/tries to get discounts, hence why I hardly want to go out with her. My father, on the other hand, makes comments about my appearance and always leaves me feeling far worse after seeing him.

To be transparent, I feel very detached from my family and can understand where my sister is coming from. I make minimal effort to spend time with them unless I absolutely have to.

I love my sister, but I’m extremely tired of feeling guilty for not wanting to be with my family as often as she does. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to spend time with my dad anymore because he basically mocked my health condition?
content: I(18f) have seizures that have not been diagnosed yet. I started having seizures at 12 and I continue to have them. Both of my parents are single and I go with my dad(38m) every weekend. But one weekend I decided I wanted to stay with my mom(35f) and when my mom told my dad he got angry and told my mom that he’s happy that I didn’t want to spend time with him because he doesn’t want my grandma(56f) and my pop pop(58m) to think my “Down syndrome” is from his side of the family and it hurt my feelings and my heart so I told my mom I don’t want to spend time with him AT ALL for the rest of my life because I was always and still is insecure about my condition and for him to say that to me that hurt me so aita??",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to spend time with my mom?
content: I (F17) and my mom have never really gotten along. My entire childhood and most of my teenage years so far have all been about trying to be a perfect golden child. Always wining awards and having straight a’s. I honestly got fed up. I mean im putting all this effort and time to make her proud and all she had to say is stuff like kys, you’re worthless, you’re a whore, I should’ve aborted you, you’re nothing, and other fucked shit. After every nasty fight she would always come and tell me how I owe her all my money because she’s my mother and she’s been taking care of me. Now enough of the past. As you see we don’t have a good relationship. Since I was 15 I was open to her and straight up told her at 18 I am leaving. In a couple months I’ll be turning 18 and all she does is try to spend as much time with me claiming,”you’re a whore who just sleeps with her boyfriend and goes to work, you need to spend time and money on your mother in order to ever be successful or have a good life.” I usually ignore her. But this recent fight she really crossed a line she kept calling me a slut and that I was a freebie that my bf should be paying rent bc he comes over to see me “all the time” and that “at least whores charge for their services” I’m not gonna lie it hella hurt my feelings. So I’ve been avoiding her and just stopped inviting my boyfriend over. She now is getting mad that I don’t go out and refuse to hangout with her. Am I the Asshole for pushing my mom away?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to watch my wife's new puppy?
content: I 35M, and my 37F just got a puppy. She's been asking for years to get one and I've always said I didn't want the responsibility of looking after one because they are a lot of work, and my career is very stressful and I like to enjoy my off time by relaxing at home or traveling. 

That didn't stop her as she was always constantly looking for one and always sending me pictures. I can't remember how many times I shared my concerns and feelings for not wanting one. Anyways, she sent me a picture of one that looked like her old dog that died a few years ago and said she really wanted to see it, so I agreed.

When we're at the pet store, my wife starts bawling her eyes out, saying she really wants the puppy. I said it wasn't a good idea, but I agreed that if she was willing to be the one to take after her, I would be ok with it.

We've had her now for a few weeks, and things are going OK. I help out a lot, play with her when I get home from work, take her outside, help feed, and take care of her and watch her when my wife's on meetings or has to run errands. I love her, and she is a sweet puppy.

To the problem, my wife is traveling for work the next couple of weeks. Puppy is 3/4 months old, and my wife expects me to take care of her when she's gone.  I told her I don't know if I will have the energy do to take care of the puppy with my work schedule, and reminded her of the deal we made when we got the puppy that I didn't want to be responsible for it. 

We've gotten into several big fights since then, so I decided I would ask you all to decide if AITA for not wanting to watch the puppy that I didn't want.

Edit: because I'm not sure if this is relevant....we rescued a pitbull/lab (6M) mix 3 years ago. In the same situation as we are in now,  I was against it, but she was adamant, so I agreed. Her dog from before we were together was 12F and ready to move on to doggy heaven. It was a heartbreaking experience for my wife. The dog helped her with her loss.  He grew more of a bond with me, and I think that's why she wanted another puppy to train. 

I have no problem looking after a fully grown/mature dog. He stays home with me. The issue is that a puppy requires a lot of attention and supervision

Edit2: I will take care of the puppy. She lives in a good home in a good neighborhood.  The main issue is my wife dumping this responsibility on me when I was against it from the start. So AITA?",info
"title: AITA for not warning my hookup about the snake room?
content: Ok apologies for the clickbaity title but that's literally what it is. 

I bought a house a year ago and living alone in a 3 bedroom house, I had plenty of room to spare. 

I have a pet snake, a ball python, she's full grown at 4.5 feet long. She's very lazy and chill, and mostly just lays around under the heat lamps in her tank. 

But when I bought the house, I decided to let her have the run of a room, since I had extra space. I sealed up the windows, door, vents, light fixtures, pretty much any crack she could try to squeeze through, and leave the top off her tank so she can roam around. I got some big pieces of driftwood and screwed them together to make basically a big cat tree for snakes, she loves climbing it and hanging out by the window. 

 Though a lot of the time she still lays in the tank since she likes the heat lamp. I've also got a few aquariums and terrariums in there with my octupus and lizards (all very well covered to keep the snake out lol) 

I've also got a sign on the door that says ""no step on snek"" (this one lol https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518gmSwLrvL.jpg) 

So with that context - I had a guy over my house for a hookup, we'd met at a bar, judge if you want lol but that was the situation. 

And for some reason he went upstairs to use the bathroom (I told him where it was) and after peeing went and opened the snake room door? I only noticed when I was downstairs getting us some waters, and he yelled from upstairs and slammed the door. 

He was yelling that there was a snake in my house and I called back that I knew, that was my snake, she's chill. He came downstairs screaming at me that I should of warned him, that I was a crazy (b word) for having a snake just out in a room that he thought was my bedroom.

I asked him why he was going thru my rooms anyway, I just said he could use my bathroom. He said he was looking for my bedroom because he assumed I'd meet him up there? But he was basically berating me for having a snake and not telling him. 

I said there was literally a sign saying the snake was there on the door, and he basically called me crazy again and walked out, saying I should have told him before he came over

I felt like I didn't need to since it's not like I would have brought him in there anyway and didn't think he'd just be going around looking in all the rooms? Like that's kinda weird...

"title: AITA for not “coming to the rescue” when my boyfriends tire blew out?
content: This is my first post so bear with me here. I will try to answer any questions as I am not the great of a writer. 

I F(20) and my (now ex) boyfriend (21) were hanging out at my apartment together from around 5pm to 10:30pm. I got tired and said I was going to bed and he said he was going to leave. (He lives 5 minutes down the road from where I lived at the time.) 
He decided to take the long way and his tire blew out while he was on the drive to his apartment. The next morning I woke up to tons of texts and voicemails saying his tire blew out, he was stranded for hours on end, and had to call the cops at 2am to be taken home. I immediately jumped out of bed and tried getting an answer as to what happened and if he was okay (he was). The entire day was met with mostly silence and him saying it was my fault that he got stranded and it was my fault he had to call the police and be taken home in a cop car. 

Was it really my fault that I didn’t answer his calls and text messages? Am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for only taking one of my nephews on days out
content: So I F28, have two nephews, M7, who we’ll call W, and M18months, who we’ll call J. 
So W is my step nephew and every other weekend he is with his dad so we don’t see him. 
The problem is that when he is at home, he’s so badly behaved that they don’t do anything or go anywhere. No days out. No family trips. Nothing. They don’t even sit in the same room all together because his behaviour is so bad towards J. 
He then goes to his dads for the weekend and goes on all sorts of fun family trips and days out with his dad and family. 
But my brother and SIL don’t do anything with J because ‘it isn’t fair for W to miss out.’ 
I don’t think this is fair as W gets days out and gifts, and J doesn’t get to ever leave the house because of W. 
So I started taking J twice a week and we go on fun days out, the park, aquarium, beach, meet with my friends who have kids the same age so he can play. 
I think it’s important for him to be out and experiencing the world and socialising. 
I’ve been told that I need to stop because of favouritism. They said it isn’t fair that J goes out 2 times and week and W doesn’t. 
I said W is in school everyday. He then goes out with his dad every other weekend. And the reason you don’t all go anywhere is because you can discipline him enough and say no, or stop. J shouldn’t have to miss out because his brother is so bad. 
I refused to stop taking him out, and said that if I’m babysitting him then I’m going to make plans. 
So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for ordering for my mom?
content: During our travels we went to this bucket-list coffee shop, I ordered for myself a basic American along with my fiancé who ordered a special chai. 

I wanted to order my mom a red or black tea. The problem is everything on the menu was a blend of cardamom and cinnamon or cardamom and nutmeg. I asked if I could get just plain red tea and I was denied. My mom doesn’t particularly like cinnamon. But I wasn’t sure how well she would like nutmeg either, plus the majority had milk and I know she wasn’t in the mood for a chai, she was in the mood for a red or black tea. So I went ahead with the only red tea even though it had some cinnamon in it. 

When she got her drink she was upset. She was so upset she nearly made a scene and the customers in the table next to us looked over. I told her I tried getting her something she would like but she says I don’t do anything right. She says I’m an asshole because I didn’t come ask her what she wanted first. But we were rushing because we needed to leave. I offered to get her something else and she refused and a few minutes later she went ahead and asked them to replace it. 

AITA?

This kind of behavior is common in my family. And I go through it on a weekly basis multiple times. So no, this post isn’t just about a cup of tea.",yta
"title: AITA for passing a sparky comment about my sister's in-laws?
content: My (F23) sister (F28) is currently engaged and preparing for her wedding. For the longest time, she has wanted to go to Maldives. So, fBIL and she decided to make it their honeymoon destination. The trip was their wedding gift from her FIL. For context, EVERYONE in our family and BIL's family knows about her wish to visit Maldives.

We are Indians and this is an arranged marriage situation so she was planning the trip outfits and photograph ideas and itinerary with her to-be SIL as a ""family-bonding"" activity. They exchanged links of outfits they saw online and everything was going well.

So, the other day my sister and a few aunts and I were doing some wedding related work (packing favors and other return gifts for the guests) when my sister's face suddenly fell (she was on her phone). Apparently, her future sister in law and her husband took an impromptu trip to Maldives three weeks before the wedding. They stayed at the same resort where my sister was supposed to be staying, but at a better/pricier room. It was almost as if the SIL and her husband had the same exact trip but upgraded with more activities/experiences.

My sister found out about their trip while scrolling through Instagram. She didn't say anything and just handed the phone to me. Obviously I was shocked because I knew that was a very deliberate decision as the sister-in-law is the golden/pampered child of that family. I just sighed and shrugged and said ""good luck, you'll need it there"" and my SISTER BURST INTO TEARS and left the room.

Later, mom and a few other aunts TORE ME A NEW ONE yelling at me about how I made my sister cry with my comments about her new family. They said I was poisoning her head by manipulating her into thinking that her new family was BAD. They said that my sister doesn't OWN Maldives and that other people can go there too (true, but the timing is sus). I think they didn't realise that she cried because of the betrayal and not because of me pointing it out. But after everyone has scolded me because of the incident, I'm not sure. AITA?

Edit: my sister thinks that her SIL is the AH here but my family thinks that I coloured her opinion and that she thinks that only because of my initial reaction to the Instagram posts.

Edit2: So, I did a little bit of digging these past couple of hours and it looks like SIL has a bit of a narcissistic streak. She wears her own wedding outfit to the weddings of cousins/friends and says it's her personal tradition. Although it's impossible to one-up a South Asian bride, she certainly tries her best at every event. One of the groom's cousins (an old friend by coincidence) also mentioned that she had admitted to her family that she HATES it when people get/have nicer things than her and will always relentlessly try to equal or one-up the situation. This is true because she has been asking my sister the colour of her wedding outfits so that they could ""twin"". She did the same during the engagement party.",yta
"title: AITA for paying for my daughters wedding but not my sons?
content: 
Too make a long story short my son was a teen dad. His girlfriend at the time got pregnant right after they graduated high school and I practically raised their baby girl up until they both graduated college and got jobs. During this time I had my full focus on my grandchild which caused me to very stupidly not pay enough attention to my daughter. We’ve made up since and I’ve been making up for lost time with her. 

The issue is I’m paying for her wedding but I never paid anything for my sons. I felt like I’d already done and spent more than enough for their family that there was no reason for me to. I got them a good gift and a chunk of change and deemed it enough. He’s been causing issues with me and his sister about this and has been slandering us on facebook saying it’s unfair how I’m paying for her wedding but not his. 

I understand feeling a bit bitter but I’ve spent way more money keeping his family and him afloat than I have on my daughters wedding. Honestly paying for her wedding doesn’t even seem enough for what I did. I don’t know how to feel right now and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could give me feedback on this.",nta
"title: AITA for picking a fight with my friends after they told us they'd get us food and didn't?
content: We're a group of friends and had a gap between our lectures, so some of us decided they'll get us food/drinks while the rest of us waited. We waited 45 minutes and they weren't back, so I called them to ask where they were. My friend told me they were filming a tiktok and lost track of time and that they haven't went to get food yet so I got pissed and told her not to get me any food because by the time they would be back it'd be time for the lecture so I wouldn't be able to eat and after that we go home so there's no point. And then I told them they were annoying for what they did cause they could've called to let us know they were busy and we could've gotten our own food.


I admit I was already pissed because we're suppose to be a group of friends, and yet every time we're together, two or three of them would get away slightly and start whispering together and giggling. Sometimes they'd tell us they're going to the bathroom quickly and then they disappear. I don't mind if they want to talk about something that they don't want us to know about but I find it extremely rude when we're standing together and they call each other and start whispering by themselves. They used to include me in the whispers but I'd always tell them it's rude to do that in front of our other friends and that if they wanted to talk privately about something they should do it when we're alone, but they didn't see my point and thought i was exaggerating. One of our other friends even got upset about that and felt like she wasn't included and stopped hanging out with us for a while and i had to talk to her to tell her we care about her and stuff. 

Now I'm not sure if I'm in the right by being pissed or if it's not that big of a deal, and I'm just jealous. I admit i was jealous at the beginning, but I feel like now I'm more annoyed cause I find it rude when they do it, and they were annoying today. Especially cause they even lie to me/us sometimes.",nta

"title: AITA for planning a trip with my boyfriend instead of my son?
content: I (30M) have a son (14M) Duncan, who I’ve been a single parent of since I graduated uni when I was 21. My parents did most of the childcare before then. I’ve been with my boyfriend (29M) James for a year and a few months. 

It was James’ birthday recently and he’s been talking about wanting to go on a trip for a while now so I decided to pay for the two of us to go on a bit of a romantic getaway. It’s not something we’ve really been able to do before. 

The problem is the only time I’m going to be able to get off work to do this falls over a time of year where traditionally me and Duncan would go on a trip together. We’ve done it every year since I started taking care of him full-time. Ideally he’d come with us too of course - I know James wouldn’t mind - but there’s a cost of living crisis right now and I can’t really afford to pay for three people. I have family who’d be happy to take him while we were gone so that’s not a concern. 

I had a conversation with Duncan where I told him I wouldn’t be able to do the trip this year, and why, and I promised to find a way to make it up to him later in the year. He said he understood but it clearly upset him quite a bit though he was trying not to show it, which did make me feel guilty. 

On the day of James’ birthday we went to a big party with his friends but beforehand we had a smaller celebration beforehand at my place with my son. I gave him the gift from me there and he really loved it! Duncan really tried his best to be super happy and celebratory - he’s such a good kid - but James noticed something was bothering him and asked me about it later, and I explained the situation. 

That was during the party so we moved on quickly at the time but a few days ago he came to me and said that while he really appreciated the gift, it made him feel mean to take something that clearly matters a lot away from Duncan. He offered to pay for himself so Duncan could come with us, which is obviously very generous but then I basically just haven’t given him anything for his birthday? I do feel guilty about disappointing Duncan, but it’s just one trip so it’s not the end of the world. Just typing that last sentence out made me feel a little evil though, so AITA for wanting to stick to doing the holiday as I originally planned?",yta
"title: AITA for pointing out where the bathroom was to a mother with her baby?
content: So, I (20F) don't have siblings, younger/baby cousins and overall never dealt closely with babies before, just in those brief moments like when you're in line and there's someone with a baby before you and the baby smiles at you.

The thing situation is: after my therapy session was over, I went to the waiting room to wait for a lift, and there was a huge family there. Like grandparents, sisters, aunt. The man who seemed to be the grandfather was taking care of a baby who I presumed doesn't have barely 6 months. Then the baby started to cry and her mother suddenly appeared and stated that she needed a diaper change. She asked for the aunt of the baby to fetch a bag with baby stuff and proceeded to simply lay the child down in one of the couches where a guy who didn't seem like part of the family was sat. He even said something in surprise, since the woman didn't say anything and just laid the baby there and started to take the diaper off. 

Given the situation and the awkwardness, and since they were new to the clinic, I pointed out that there was a bathroom right at the end of the room in case the mother wanted more privacy and tranquility to change her baby, especially because the little girl didn't stop crying and the random dude had to sort of hold her so she didn't roll out of the couch. When I said that, the woman shot me a very pissed off, angry look and said very curtly that ""I should know better that there wasn't any diapers changer there"". I fell quiet and every family member of hers looked at me like I've said the most offensive thing ever. Luckily, my mother came to pick me up right after that.

When I told her that, she laughed and said I should've kept quiet because the mother probably misunderstood it as me being bothered by it. I replied that I said it in the calmest tone possible (which is true), but my mother still said that it was kind of a jerk move from my part, and now I'm stuck thinking about this. AITA?

EDIT 1: I don't know if it's relevant, but the family's car was parked just in front of the clinic, and it was a huge SUV. The aunt went to the car to fetch the baby's bag and I could see it from the window. The baby even was in her baby comfort/bebe confort. Her stuff bag was so full I thought it had a changing mat in it because it'd sure fit one. I also thought the mother could change the baby in the baby comfort, so even if she didn't have the mat, she could maybe bring the baby to the WC and change her in the comfort. I didn't know that according to the baby's age, you have to lie them down to change them.

EDIT 2: The WC's counter has a huge surface area. It is both wide and long, so I believe it could easily fit the baby since she wasn't big. The counter is never wet too, even around the sink. And they always keep tons of toilette paper there.",nta
"title: AITA for posting a photo of a minor to a private neighborhood group of 150 HOA members?
content: I just moved into a new construction home and neighborhood. As a neighborhood we have been having a lot of trouble with people choosing to not pick up their dogs poop. Today I was playing outside with my young daughter and she found a bright green bag and picked it up. It wasn’t till I got closer that I realized that she was squeezing a poop bag. I was mad and annoyed that one of my neighbors would be that disrespectful to bag up their dog poop and leave it out. I went to my security camera to see who created the problem. I was able to get a shot of the person and the dog. Upon seeing the person I realized it matched the same description from another neighbor that posted that morning about the same incident happening in front of their house. I chose to post the photo of the kid to our private HOA group since the previous post with only a description did not gain any traction. 
Later that evening I was greeted by my direct neighbor who I have been great with. He informed me that he was friends. With the kids parents and he thought I was out of line posting a photo of a minor. He asked me how I’d feel if someone posted that same photo of one of my children when they were bigger. I told him I’d walk my child to that house have them knock on the door and apologize. My neighbor was adamant that I crossed a line by posting a photo of a minor. While I may not understand the neighbors frustration I did offer to take the photo down and ask that he talk to the family as I have no clue who or where the kid lives in the neighborhood. 

AITA for posting the photo of the kid leaving dog shit in my yard? 

Other points of consideration I’m the type of guy who would normally have a face to face conversation, But I don’t know where the kid lives or who his parents were. This happened at least twice this weekend as another neighbor posted a similar incident. I chose a screen grab that was not clear enough to make out the kid’s face rather showed their outfit and and another distinctive item.

This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here?

"title: AITA for posting brothers wedding photos without SIL?
content: My brother(29)got married last month to his now wife(28). Her family devoured the wedding while our side was only 10 people. 
When it was time to take professional photos I knew that it was going to be the first time our side had any professional photos. I really wanted my son, mom, and 2 brothers and I all to have some shots together. I started noticing my brother and his wife had a system down where they were together each photo and different guests/family would take turns around them. We took our photos with the couple, and then I asked for some solo family shots. My sil didn’t seem too thrilled, I felt kinda bad but we only took like 3 photos max. 

Fast forward to now- I had requested for some wallet size photos and I also was getting a large 50x65 cm picture to display on my living room wall. I have a picture book I scrap in and happened to put all the wedding photos from that day inside. For my wallet/wall picture I had the photos of just our family. When my brother and sil came over a couple nights ago, I guess the living room photo on my wall caught them by surprise and my sister in law later cried to my brother that night. They couldn’t believe I hung up a picture from their wedding without her. I had plenty in my book of her, just not the one displayed on the wall. I honestly feel like my older brother is mad at me.

"title: AITA for potentially and unintentionally sabatoging my wife's career?
content: My wife (25f) and I (25m) have been attending a new church for about a year now, only attending preaching. We have only recently been comfortable enough to try to seek out small groups/ 1on1's. I recently met with a member of the church for breakfast, as a means of getting to know you and see if we vibe and if there is a connection. We were discussing our own careers, as well as our wives. Both He and my wife coincidentally work in the same field of finance and had actually recently applied for a position with my wife's company. He briefly met the office, including my wife . He had said that he had already declined it, as the connection just wasn't quite what he was looking for. I had then said, ""My wife is actually considering moving into that position, but not anytime soon, as she would need additional schooling in order to be qualified and that it's probably 2-3 years away."" We finished breakfast about 20 minutes later after talking about other random topics. I tell my wife everything and go into the details of the conversation, excited that she might be surprised with the possible connection. She was very upset that I had mentioned the idea of her moving into the role as it was supposed to be a secret, and if word got out that the company was just planning to hire from within, it would make the position impossible to fill, as anyone coming in, would just think that it is only temporary. She is now very worried for both her future prospects and current role within the c

1. I'm [26] never one to speak up a lot, I usually keep my opinions to myself.
2. My brother [23] is a bit more direct. We both still live at home btw.

So, he [my brother] was dating this girl for a few months, they said the loved each other but at some point it turned into a shitshow. One day me and him go to the gym together where I see this really cute girl and on the way out I tell him ""wow, that girl is really cute!"". 
Fast-forward to one week later, my brother and his by then ex-gf have broken up for the third time, this time it turned out to be definitive. I go to the gym again and talk to that previously mentioned cute girl a little bit and decide to send her a follow request on IG, which was accepted and reciprocated. I get home to my brother smiling and being cheerful (which was unexpected after his breakup). It turned out that he had sent the same aforementioned cute girl a DM and was now talking to her quite a bit. Bummer for me ofcourse since I was planning on sending her a DM too.
Fast forward to today.
My brother and the cute girl are starting to date and he shoots me a text while I'm at work. He asks me, in somewhat vague wording, whether my dad, him and I were going out for dinner some time this week. I tell him that I'd love that.
Well it turns out he didn't actually mean the three of us, but rather just my dad and me. This way he'd have the house to himself for a date night with the cute girl. When he told me that he wasn't in fact coming along because he wanted a date night, I told him well now I don't know if I want to come (my dad and I have a very basic relationship where we don't really do stuff together or anything, so I wasn't really feeling that). 
Now my brother is mad at me for not wanting to go out and leaving him alone with cute girl, saying he's having to cancel a lot of his plans.
So, am I the asshole?

P.s I should add I did have plans for Friday night prior to this whole thing to meet up with friends on Discord and discuss our vacation plans for the summer. Getting everyone online at the same time was no easy task either",yta
"title: AITA for pranking our friend by making him think he's at the wrong airport?
content: So we decided to have a group trip. All of us live within driving distance because we go to nearby colleges. But one friend lives around an hour flight away. So we told him we'd meet him at the airport and pick him up.

We planned the trip so that we'd pick him up at Abbotsford airport, not Vancouver. So today he arrived at Abbotsford after a 1 hr flight, and he video called us after he landed. We decided to play a joke on him and freak out and say ""dude you're at the wrong airport, we said vancouver, not abbotsford!"" We did this for literally just 20 seconds and he started freaking out as well, until he realized we were just joking. FYI he was still on the plane when he video called us, it's not like we told him to go to a different airport.

But then when we picked him up at the airport he was still kinda angry. We only joked for like 20 seconds. He was like that's super fucked up. I really don't get what was so messed up about that, it was a harmless prank.",yta
"title: AITA for preferring a tattoo convention over a birthday party?
content: I have been wanting to get a big back tattoo for years now. One of my favorite artists who is constantly booked is entering a contest in Rome, Italy and i managed to sign up for it with a pretty big discount since i am giving him my whole back for a contest.
We were together some time thinking about what we wanted to do and he managed to draw something amazing and i am so excited for it.  I payed the down payment and we were about to book our flight and accommodation.
Then i told my parents about it and my mom absolutely flipped and got angry that i was breaking her heart. It turned out to be on the same date as her birthday party. It was her birthday in march and the party is in september.  Quite some time in between because she kept picking a new date. This is because she wanted all her family and friends to be there and if one of them couldn't make it she would rearrange the date.

I am simply a guy that just doesn't care for birthday parties. I don't celebrate my own birthday and they don't really mean much to me. So i can't really relate ti why she is so angry about it.To me this seemed to be too good of an opportunity to miss so i chose the tattoo convention over a party.

So AITA for choosing this, or should i cancel everything and go to the party of my mom?",info
"title: AITA for pressuring my partner into lending me money?
content: I (23F) work two full-time jobs at once to pay off immigration fees/lawyers. I work in construction and I’ve started a cleaning business on the side for some extra money. My boyfriend (24M) is a citizen. He doesn’t come from a rich family but he’s really good at saving money and has over $100k in cash/shares.

My car recently broke down and I told my boyfriend I was thinking about getting a personal loan of about $6000 to get a second-hand car. My boyfriend advised against this and insisted that I use my cash savings (about $3000) to buy a really shitty car. The problem is, I need a car big enough to carry equipment for my jobs, and I don’t want to spend money on a car that has lots of issues where I have to spend more money to fix it.

My boyfriend offered to lend me $2000. I then kinda yelled at him and told him that if the roles were reversed I would lend him all of money instantly (which is true by the way). He accused me of being emotionally manipulative. I just think $2000 is such a slap in the face when I know that he can afford more. AITA?

Edit: Just to clarify, the car I’d need is about $9000 so I’d be taking money from my savings too

Also I’m apologising today. I guess not everyone sees money the same way I do. I’m so jealous of his life. :(",yta
"title: AITA for pretending to be an ""Appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?
content: I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

But, did I go too far?

"title: AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?
content: I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

AITA for this joke?",nta
"title: AITA for publicly telling my widowed sister I’ll never move on like she did?
content: Throwaway for privacy.

My sister Jane and I’s husbands passed away together in an accident 6 years ago. Jane and her first husband have 2 children. Jane remarried around a year after the passing and went on to have 2 more kids with new husband.

I have 3 teenager kids from my late husband. I haven’t dated since the accident and i don’t  plan to. I know this is controversial for many, and I seriously don’t need my comments overflown with people telling me it’s okay to love again. I know it is. Please. I have no interest. I have done tons of therapy as have our kids. Nothing is directly ’wrong’ with me. I had my one big life altering love and I’m okay with going the rest of my life reminiscing that. 

My family has over the years tried to set me up, give me speeches and otherwise convince me to find a new romantic partner. I have tried everything to shut it down but they are adamant I need to date again, because of their constant pressure I’ve distanced myself a lot. I still see them mostly for the kids’ sake. I’m also very close to my in-laws and my husband’s entire family. 

My parents hosted a birthday dinner for my mom and during dinner Jane once again asked when I was gonna start dating and listed friends of her new husband who she thought suitable. I told her no and to please drop it, to which Jane replied with ‘it’s been over six years, you need to get over it and move on’. At this I kind of snapped, stood up and firmly told her that I wasn’t ever going to ‘move on’ and just because wanted to remarry in less than a year doesn’t mean I ever have to. 

The entire table went quiet, and Jane started yelling and insulting me. My kids also got progressively angrier with Jane and before everyone blew up I got us home. My family is texting all kinds of things from ‘your sister is right, time to move on’ to ‘it was cruel of you to shame Jane’. I have never commented on the fact that Jane moved on until this instance, but I felt my comment was fair given the circumstance. The guilt tripping is however getting to me and I’m wondering if I truly did something wrong here?",nta
"title: AITA for pulling my daughter from a waterpark trip because her teacher made her stay with a kid she doesn't like?
content: My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.

I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys. 

I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.

What happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job. 

My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a ""buddy."" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.

UPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!

Second, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.",nta
"title: AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist?
content: About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. 

I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. 

That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",nta

"title: AITA for pushing my partner to not cancel vacation plans?
content: Throwaway account. 


So my partner (24M) and I (25F) have been planning a trip to Europe with my sister (25F) and her partner (26M) since about January. At that point, everyone was supper excited and importantly, my partner was consistently on board with any plans made. 

So fast forward to March, plans changed from being a Mediterranean/Italian trip to finally settling on Oktoberfest and Austria in the Fall. This change was made since although my sister and I wanted to do Italy, the boys were less enthused (my partner had spent time in Italy before and the other had wanted to do Oktoberfest and loved traveling Germany). 

Since then, my sister and I put probably a hundred hours into planning to ensure a smooth week and a half since we will be going to 5 different cities in two countries. The boys lent little to no assistance beyond nodding when prices were discussed and validating we seemed to be planning a fun trip. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I’m visiting my partner (we are long distance) and I’m going on and on about how excited I am and how good of a job I feel we did and showing pictures of the places we’re going and he just smiled and said how he couldn’t wait to go with me. 

Then Saturday we’re on a call with other people in our friend group (including the two going on the trip) and he says he wants to talk to me about something just us. I laugh and hop off and call him (he’s been working through professional exams for his job and had spent the day studying so I assumed it was about this). Unfortunately not, he said he didn’t think he could do the trip anymore. 

From here, I asked why and where it was coming from. He started a new job a bit over a month ago, got a new car in March, and so on. He does live within his means. He was concerned about taking time off since starting a new job which I reminded isn’t until 5 months in. Then he said he’d prefer to get more paychecks and paying late June or July would be good for him and I said no problem, I can front him now and he can pay me when he can (I have a nice budget for travel so especially if he plans to pay me back, it won’t be a hardship) and ticket prices will skyrocket by then if they’re even available. He didn’t seem to like this. 

Additionally, he only told the others yesterday afternoon after they were online ready to just buy their tickets. They’re upset since they also spent months working to make this trip happen. 

Also before anyone says go without him, the trip becomes much more expensive with just three (lodging now split three ways instead of four) and honestly being on an arguable romantic trip as a third wheel sounds dreadful. 

I have told him I don’t want tangible things and how going on this would be all I’d want giftwise from him in general (I don’t value physical items and I’m able to get anything I need or want for myself, but I can’t buy his time and shared experiences). 

Anyway, AITA for being so upset and trying to get him to reconsider?",nta
"title: AITA for putting a baggie of dog poop in someone's trash can?
content: Well, then, Reddit. Long time reader, first time asshole.

I regularly walk my dog (a ~25lb good boy) along the same route in my neighborhood. As anyone who has done this knows, from time to time every dog will stop to do its business. Today was a normal day, in all respects but one.

I religiously carry poop bags (""biodegradable"" ones, though what they REALLY are is ""industrially compostable"", a thing which from what I can tell never actually happens) to pick up my dog's leavings. I did that today, and as I usually do, I dropped it in the nearest house's easily-available trash can (sitting in the driveway). I have done this *many* times, and nobody has ever said a thing to me.

Today, as I was walking back to the sidewalk (a journey of roughly 10 meters), the owner of the house returned in their vehicle and asked if I had put dog poop in their trash can. I said yes, not thinking anything of it. This person proceeded to tell me that THEY didn't have a dog, and THEY didn't want my dog's poop in their trash can, and to never do that again. I was blown away. I have known this person for essentially my entire life, as I grew up two houses down the street from this person. They didn't recognize me (I have recently lost significant weight), but even when I told them who I was, they remained adamant that this was offensive and that I was never to do it again. I replied that it was better than leaving the poop on their grass, but they were not swayed.

Reddit, I have always considered this to be part of the social contract; I bag and remove my dog's poop, and you allow me to put the bagged poop in your trash can. I have never and would never go over a fence or barrier, nor would I go through a gate, even an open one, but many people keep trash cans in front of their house, and I never thought twice about using it so I didn't have to carry the bag a couple miles back home.

Am I doing the wrong thing? Am I the asshole here?",yta
"title: AITA for putting a private conversation on loud speaker which cost my brother his 18 year relationship
content: Ok guys I’m extremely tried and it’s been a long ass day so please excuse any poor grammar or spelling mistakes 


To begin my brother Ben (39m fake name ) has been in a relationship with Abby(39 fake name) 18 years. They’ve been engaged 8 years they’ve nearly gotten married 3 years ago but months before the wedding Ben chickened out. 

They went to therapy and basically because our dad left us he has issues with commitment.
We thought over the last year he was finally gonna step up for Abby and be the partner she deserves. He did seem a bit anxious leading up to the big day but assured everyone he was ok 


Today they were meant to get married but as abby and us bridesmaids were about to enter the church Ben was no where to be found 

Everyone tried to calm her down saying it was traffic or he probably had a monster hangover.
Well an hour passed, than two, than three and than after the four hour mark Abby said fuck she was going back to the hotel call her when he landed.

My family looked panicked and nervous trying to get through to Ben or the groomsmen who had not arrived yet 

My other brothers and brother in laws (sister’s husband) went looking for him thinking he got hurt or arrested the night before 

I went back to the hotel with a very broken looking Abby. We drank and ate food for another hour before I got a text from my brother in law saying they found him in a bar and they were trying to talk him into GOING TO HIS OWN WEDDING. My sister rang her husband and heard him in the background  he was literally acting like a 5 year old who didn’t want to go to the doctor 

Honestly guys I had enough at this stage he mess this girl about too long and frankly leading someone along for 18 years is just cruel 


So he’s here’s were I maybe the asshole of the century. I walked into Abby’s room and told her be quiet than I rang my brother in law put him on loud speaker and asked him what was going on than for him to put Ben on the phone the drunk fool started saying shit like he didn’t think she was the one and he is only with her because they’ve been together to long and he is scared to be alone 

I let her hear everything I won’t lie I felt like a monster when she started crying. Abby than grabbed the phone told him he had one hour to get to the church or it was over for good 


Long story short Ben ended up at the Church 20 minutes later and Abby took off her dress than left the hotel alone 

So he ended being left a the Alter and she went on the honeymoon alone. I’ve been disowned by everyone expect two siblings (sisters) and I had to get Abby’s maid of honour to collect my suitcase from outside the hotel (mom dumped out when she found out) 

I’m the full blame for ruining their relationship and 98% of my family hates me",nta
"title: AITA for putting an end to an office joke?
content: Coming back from lunch today, I saw that 2 colleagues trapped 2 other colleagues in an office by blocking the door with a pallet truck.

This kind of things happens a lot, these colleagues often make ""pranks"" on each other, and it’s mostly in good spirit. It never reached this level before though. 

I get along very well with every colleague involved, but also made it clear I don’t want in on this kind of jokes. No one was agressive or rude at any point.

The trapped colleagues, while not distressed at all, were banging on the window to be let out because they had things to do, and I was told they were locked in since at least 15 minutes, and the pranksters were planning to let them like that at least 15 minutes more.

I went to unlock the door, and one of the pranksters prevented me from doing so. Another colleague, who was also prevented from doing so previously, came up, and while they were distracted, I opened the door.

Everything went smoothly, again, it’s mostly in good fun. But during the rest of my shift, I got some passive-aggressive comments from the pranksters, for ruining the fun, having a bias for the trapped colleagues.

I am pretty uncomfortable with this situation. I understand some people enjoy this kind of jokes, but I don’t like being caught in the middle of it, and that maybe I shouldn’t have interfered.

"title: AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it
content: I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?",nta
"title: AITA for putting my dog's poop in another person's trash can?
content: The other day, I was walking my dog through my neighborhood. I happened to be on the phone.

Suddenly, a truck pulled up next to me, and the woman motioned for me to stop and come around to her window. The interaction went something like this:

""Is this yours"" as she shook the dog poop bag in my face.""Uh, maybe. It looks like my bags.""""Don't throw your dog's shit in my trash can. That it so unbelievably rude. I don't shit in your trash can. It's so disrespectful for you to think that leaving this in my trash can is okay.""

I hadn't taken my headphone out before walking to her window, so while I was talking to her, the person I was on the phone with was also talking. There was so much going on, I was having a hard time processing the already ridiculous situation.

I was truly stunned. She handed me the poop bag (along with a questionable paper towel) and I took it out of reflex. I sincerely apologized and she drove away. It was such a strange interaction, I didn't know what else to do.

Here's the thing, though - it was trash day. Her trash can was on the curb. I didn't go out of my way to find her bin, and the poop would have been in there for 4 hours max before the truck came to empty it.

So, did she see me put the poop bag in there, and then jump in her car to chase me down? She found me like 5 minutes later, so she really committed to this bit.

Was this rude? It's not a huge deal to me to just carry the poop bags somewhere else,  and in the future, I won't use her trash can, obviously. But what's the consensus?

"title: AITA for putting my kid first?
content: My son (12) and I live alone. I get child support from his father. His father married (we never were) eight years ago and has had three kids since then. Each time he filed to have child support reduced and each time he was denied. The judge said reducing child support because of having more kids creates an incentive to have more kids to screw over former partners. He has said the child support will never go down until my son is 18.

His wife contacted me. She said she is pregnant with a high risk pregnancy and needs time off work, but they can't afford to live off of his salary since so much goes to child support. She asked me to agree to have it reduced. I said no, because I don't want my son to have less. She said I'm a selfish bitch because I only work part time and live mostly off of her husband's salary. She said I should get a real job or find my own man instead of relying on someone else's for support.

"title: AITA for putting non-English label on food and caused an allergic reaction
content: Not in USA. 

I’m currently visiting my parents who live in another city, staying at their place. A week ago my sister decided to come for a visit as well, bringing her boyfriend and his son, Rob (15). Our parents’ house is big with several room, so space is not a problem.

My sister’s boyfriend is from another country and doesn’t speak our language. Rob’s mother is on a honeymoon with her new husband, so he’s staying with my sister’s boyfriend. We use English to talk to them, though my parents don’t really speak English. Rob mostly keeps to himself. We usually only see him at mealtimes. Rob is allergic to shrimps, and my sister made sure we are all aware of that.

A couple nights ago I went out with my friends to a restaurant/pub. We had dinner there and then just drank at the same table well into the night. We ordered a lot of food to share and had quite a bit of leftovers. The restaurant packed the food for us and we wrote our names on the boxes, everyone getting a box to take home. 

I was not so plastered because I remembered taking my shoes off properly and putting my leftover in the fridge, but I was drunk enough to sleep like the dead for several hours straight after. 

When I woke up, I learned that early this morning my sister and her boyfriend took Rob to the hospital. As it turns out, he ate my leftover which was fried eggs with chopped/minced shrimp, making Rob unable to see that the dish contains shrimp.

Rob is fine, but my sister says I’m AH for not labeling food with shrimp in it when I know Rob is allergic. She said my name in our language doesn’t count as labeling when we have guests who don’t read the language and one of them is a teenager who is bound to get hungry at any hour. 

I don’t think I should be responsible for people eating my food without asking me first. Reddit, AITA?

Edit: Thanks for the responses!

Some clarifications: 1) when I was out with friends we ordered food in several communal dishes and everyone ate a little bit from every plate. The food is not contaminated because we used serving spoons. The leftover did look like takeout.

2) In my culture, we eat out/order in a lot because the food is cheap. We have several boxes of food we ordered in the fridge. We don’t write anything on them though, so mine should stand out for this reason.

3) My language does not use Roman alphabet. 

4) Rob ate the food at like 6 in the morning. Breakfast is around 8/9. 

5) Hospital maybe the wrong translation. More like a small government medical center. Rob had rashes but he was not in life threatening danger.",nta
"title: AITA for putting parental controls on my TV and royally pissing off my FIL?
content: I (M30's) live with my wife (F30's). We have two kids, M8 and F6.

My wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.

I don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.

My MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not ""college house party bass tearing apart the walls"" loud but it is still loud.

My kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.

My wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.

I've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.

My FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.

He complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through ""a bit of everyday noise"".

I told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.

I've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.

I decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.

My FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. 

I'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.

"title: AITA for questioning my husband's choice to buy a motorcycle?
content: My husband and I have been having some financial arguments lately. We have been together for four years and we have shared bank accounts.

For background: My husband used to be a successful entrepreneur in our home province, making well over $150,000K a year. He had access to multiple lines of credit. He used to use these lines of credit to purchase ""toys"", like snowmobiles, boats, and motorcycles, which he would enjoy for a season or two, and sell them for a profit. He gave up his portion of the business to his family (didn't sell it), and moved to a new province with me for my medical residency. He has liquidated a portion of his assets (ex. toys that he was no longer using, like an airplane and motorcycles), which resulted in an extra $20K for us to spend on living expenses. We agreed at that time that it should be allocated for our living expenses, and once we were in a good financial position later on in life, he could use the $20K to purchase some toys back.

For the first year and a half of my residency, he was not working.  Unfortunately he developed depression and alcoholism, and decided that he needed to work again. A few months ago he started working at a job that pays $110K a year.

I am finishing my medical residency in Family Medicine. Through medical school, I accrued $130K in debt. I currently make $60k a year. I will graduate in two months, and my income will be around $300K/year.

Because my husband has only worked for a few months of the last year, and I only make $60K a year, we are still in a lot of debt. Our monthly net income is about $10K, and $1500 is allocated towards each person for a ""fun fund,"" in which we can spend the money on whatever we want. He currently has $3000 left over in his fun fund, which has been saved up from the previous few months.

He is currently eyeing up a motorcycle that is about $7K in price, which is more than double of what he has left in his fun fund. He does not have a plan on how he will obtain the extra $4K. He says that the money he got from liquidating his old toys ($20K), should be potentially returned to him. The only source of extra money we have is my medical line of credit, but I would like to pay that down instead. Furthermore, we have to purchase a new vehicle as one of our vehicles broke down, which will be $15K. We also purchased him a new e-mountain bike a few months ago, which was $10K. We are also hoping to save for a down payment on a house in this new province, which will be about $150-200K. He also has two other motorcycles which he doesn't ride.

When he asked for my permission for him to buy the motorcycle, I asked him how he would find the extra funds. He said that he would ""figure it out"" as he ""always did in the past."" He then became very angry with me, and accused me of being non-supportive. He says that he feels ""trapped"" because he will never be like his old self - the spontaneous, risk taking, entrepreneur. We have been in a fight the entire weekend. I am exhausted.",nta

He just got out of this relationship after many years of trying to leave but failing. He got another girlfriend (we’ll call her Tammy) about 5 months after breaking up. After awhile of them dating I started to notice similarities between Tammy and my dads ex. For one thing she was offended very easily, which I didn’t like because I couldn’t say what i wanted around her, and when she was upset she would blast it on social media, very negatively, trying to blame everyone except herself. She has also, in the past, harassed me for not wanting to go to her house. Recently my dad messaged my mom about insurance money… at 9 pm. Which, my mom being tired, messaged back kind of rudely. Which made Tammy, who has no right to know about insurance or child support money, continually messaged my mom angrily. Which made me message Tammy with the laws of harassment in Ontario, Canada. Which says that harassment is considered 2 or more texts, because I was fed up with her emotional manipulation and harassment. Now a couple days later I find out that she was stressed because one of her friends died. But she has, believe it or not, used that as an excuse before.

"title: AITA for ratting out my friend?
content: I became friends with a guy through club soccer recently, even though we’ve been at the same school for a few years. After games we like to take a bus into the central city and bum around a bit, get some food, etc., but last time, before we left, he wanted to stop in at one of the supermarkets which had those self-checkout machines. He said the security was super lax and that the workers didn’t pay proper attention, so he grabbed a chocolate bar, a carton of milk and some bread and only payed for the bar, then took it all home with him. It’s been really bugging me and my mom caught on over dinner, so I told her about it. My mom knew my friends mom from soccer and tried to comfort me, saying he was probably just trying to help his family out, since they might be struggling considering his dad walked off after his brother was born. I know they could be having a hard time, but I just can’t shake the feeling that what he did was wrong. If everybody stole, it would destroy the economy. Couldn’t he help out by getting a part time job? So I ended up making an anonymous call to the supermarket to tip them off. My friend got called up to the office last period today and I’ve not heard from him since. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for recording my (29F) boyfriend (30M) without his knowledge?
content: Throwaway. While the title may make it seem pretty cut and dry, there are some mitigating factors that complicate who is the AH in this situation, at least in my opinion.

In arguments with my boyfriend, he’ll often accuse me of forgetting or misrepresenting his words or mine through the argument. Now the issue. One conversation (not the night of the incident) I’d become frustrated with this and said how sick I was of being told I didn’t know what happened throughout our arguments. I felt like he was making me out to be a crazy person and I didn’t believe that I was consistently misunderstanding things when I’d never had this problem before. I suggested we record an argument so we can listen back and see what was actually said. He agreed, feeling it would prove the opposite to me.

Onto the actual night: at some point during the start of an argument, he was talking and I remembered the idea to record. Not wanting to interrupt, I tapped record on my smartwatch, and we continued to talk. Once there was a lull I said I’d started recording and he was shocked and immediately angry. I reminded him of our recent conversation, but he was livid that I thought it was okay to record him without saying so first. I said that I’d thought it was okay because we’d talked about it, and I hadn’t wanted to interrupt, but that I could just stop it and delete it — and thats what I proceeded to do. 

It’s been a year since this incident and he will still bring it up as something unforgivable. Obviously, its not good to record people without their knowledge, so I may be the AH, but I felt like it was something we’d talked about and agreed to. Once I saw he took issue, I deleted it immediately. So, AITA?",info
"title: AITA for recording my brother while he was drunk?
content: Throwaway account 

Was removed at first, but I think ni have removed anything that breaks the rules.  

My brother (30m) has been an alcoholic for almost 10 years.  In and out of rehabs for as long as I can remember, he’s only been able to stay clean for 2-3 months before his inevitable relapse.  


My family had completely cut him off when he chose to be a homeless alcoholic rather than attempt sobriety and live with me, I’m also raising his child, and I have a zero tolerance alcohol policy with him (he’s a mean drunk). 


A few months back, while drunk, he was in a terrible accident and almost lost his life.  He spent over a month in ICU, and against all odds, he’s alive.  He apologized for his actions and I decided to let him live with me while he physically recovered.  It was good for a few months, he was actually able to spend time with his kid, and really embraced being a dad. Until last week. 



He’s well enough to walk to the liquor store now, which he did, and he was on a rampage.  So I pulled out my phone and started recording because he loves to deny he’s done anything.  In his words, “I can’t feel bad if I don’t remember” 

While I was recording, I asked him to make a choice, be an homeless alcoholic again, or be a father.  He very clearly made his choice and multiple times stated alcohol was the winner.  
I told him he has to man up and tell his son why he won’t be around again, because I’m tired of being the bad guy.  When he refused, I told him I recorded our conversation and would show it to the kid for him.  He freaked out and called me a disgusting person and all sorts of other names.  

Maybe I shouldn’t have recorded him in that state, but in my opinion, ignoring what was said and blacking out isn’t an excuse to not take accountability. So AITA for recoding him?


Edit to answer some questions: 
I’m involved because his 10 years old child lives with me full time and has for years, the mom isn’t in the picture.  

I’m not going to actually show the child the video, but I wanted my brother to take accountability for once in his life.  Accept he messed up, and attempt to own it. 
I know this cycle, and he’s going to tell the kid that I kicked him out, which is not true. He had a choice, and he chose to be a drunk instead.",nta
"title: AITA for recreating a ""secret"" cookie recipe the person does not give out?
content: My boyfriend's mom makes theses amazing cookie bars. She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was ""hers"" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.

I started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).

I then decided to make it ""my own"" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.

He was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said ""One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better."" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making ""her"" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.

She started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.

While I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I ""made it even better"" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?

\*\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:

I used the recipe below for the ""base"" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.

"title: AITA for refusing a pity invite?
content: My (F20) family friend “ Phoebe” (F23) is getting married this summer. Originally I wasn’t invited, only my parents. When I found out that all the other girls in the family friend group (age range 18-22) were invited I felt really sad and excluded. Despite that, I didn’t make a scene I just accepted the fact that I wasn’t invited and I wasn’t going to ask why I wasn’t invited. 

All the girls are in a groupchat (except for Phoebe) and they were all talking about what dresses they’d wear to the wedding. I was asked in the chat what I was going to wear and I replied that I wouldn’t be at the wedding because I was not invited. All the girls were very shocked because we all grew up close, so they were confused as to why Phoebe wouldn’t invite me. I told them it was okay and that it’s not a big deal. One of the girls in the groupchat “Nadia” (F21) then said that she also wouldn’t be at the wedding because she would be on a work trip that same weekend. 

The fact that all the girls were shocked about me not being invited got back to Phoebe and she sent me this exact message this morning:

“hey! we sent out invitations for the wedding earlier this month and we know it only listed your parents , but Nadia isn’t going anymore so you could come if you’d like! The thing is we already confirmed with the caterer the exact number of people so unfortunately there won’t be seating/dinner for you at the reception. We can try to figure something out for you though! Let us know!” 

I replied,

“ Thank you for reaching out Phoebe, but unfortunately I cannot attend your wedding. We grew up together and the fact that I wasn’t even a thought to be on the original guestlist but the other girls were, speaks volumes. We’ve never had issues so I’m not sure what your thought process was with that decision. I won’t be accepting a pity invite just because someone else has canceled espec with the complications of seating/dinner. I wish you a beautiful wedding day and a happy marriage nonetheless . “ 

Apparently that text message did not go over well with Phoebe and she started telling everyone that I was being very rude for refusing her invite and calling it a “pity invite”. Now everyone is telling me that I kinda deserved not to be invited.

Raising 2 kids alone, working 60 hours a week, and maintaining my home are more than I can handle as it is, so a puppy is the last thing I need! 

My boyfriend is now upset and not speaking to me. He says he’s insulted and mad, and that because I said I wanted a dog and the dog he got me (as a total surprise, without discussing it with me first) is super cute and sweet that I should want it. He says the fact I don’t means I’m a liar and he can’t trust me!

I love dogs and sometimes mention that I’d love to have one again someday (had a dog before I had kids and really miss having one — they’re the best), and I occasionally look on Petfinder for adult dogs in shelters, but I recently stopped doing that because I knew I couldn’t adopt until my kids were off to college. 

This is making my head spin. How does he not get that I don’t want an extra mouth to feed and 15-year commitment? You can’t just surprise someone with an animal! It’s a living thing with needs. I actually tried for a day to do it, because he was so excited and the puppy was so cute, but I couldn’t take it longer than 24 hours.

I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.

My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. 

He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it.

"title: AITA for refusing to answer to a nickname I don’t like?
content: Throwaway account and fake names. I don’t think I’m TAH here but one of my coworkers does and we both follow this reddit, so we’re letting reddit decide. 

I (28F) was named after a really obscure character from Greek Mythology. My preferred nickname is taken from the end of my name. I always introduce myself with “I’m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).” None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.

For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.

Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay. 

Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge.

"title: AITA for refusing to babysit my nephew even tho my sister is a single mum with no support system?
content: Me 23 and my sister 20 have always been very close. My sister loosely talks to my parents still while I have gone no contact. The father of her child is not in the picture anymore as of right now. So she is a young single mum with a two year old and little to no support system.

A year ago my sister starting seeing a guy. He did not seem to care that she had a child and was overall really sweet. It started off great. I also really liked him and was very excited for her to have found a genuinely nice and caring partner as she had such bad luck previously. He never met my nephew as my sister is very careful in that regard.

Sadly this didn’t last as more and more red flags started to show up. He was out every weekend partying, lying about who he was with, lying about girls he was texting, you get the gist. It got really toxic between the two of them. My sister got paranoid and controlling. They went no contact multiple times. But these two just can’t get enough of eachother so it keeps on going. 

After a couple months I decided I had enough.  She kept making excuses for his behaviour. We argued about it a lot. It got to a point where I told her I won’t babysit my nephew anymore just for her to visit him. I will gladly take care of him if she has any other plans but babysitting for her to go see him was off the table. I told her I can’t support this kind of relationship as it was also negatively impacting my nephew.
That arrangement worked out for a little while but I was too soft to stick to this 100% all the time so there were definitely exceptions made.

Fast forward she finds out he had sex with two other girls he met on tinder. My sister said she was done and it was over for real.

Well fuck me. Of course it wasn’t. As soon as my nephew was in daycare she would go over to his place. I found out through parking tickets she left in her car. She freaked out and told me it’s my fault she didn’t tell me cause I would have judged her and she could not stand me judging her right now when she was already down and struggling. Fair enough. Cant even lie she was right. I just kept my composure and pushed it aside because honestly? I felt like my brain was going to explode. 

I am losing my mind over this. I feel so bad because my sister is almost all on her own and I can understand the pressure of it getting to you. To her I am completely in the wrong. This is how my sister sees the situation:

- I restrict her in her freedom because I only babysit in certain situations

- she would have no issue if I didn’t babysit at all it’s just that I decided to not babysit for this one specific reason

- she says I am acting like her mother by refusing to babysit because I think the guy is no good for her

- it’s unfair because the only free time she gets for them is when I babysit or when my nephew is in daycare and I am taking that away from her

"title: AITA for refusing to be in my father's wedding even tho I ""cheated too""?
content: A story as old as time. My (f27) father (50) cheated on my mother for 5 years with a younger woman(currently 32) and he left my mother when mistress got pregnant. It tore our family apart.

I resent my father because my mother actually loved him and she is still dealing with this. Even 1 year after he left her.
I stayed on okay terms with him because I was the one to pick up and drop off my younger brother at his place.

Last week when I picked up my brother my father had big news. He proposed to his girlfriend and wanted me as his best (wo)man. It made me kinda mad ngl. But I kept calm... And told him no. He said that what happened between him and mom was none of our business and that I should respect his new relationship. I said I respect it but that doesn't mean I condone it. Obviously I would never hound him randomly about it but I don't approve of it and I don't like her. She knew the whole time my mom and we existed .

Well my dad was having none of it and told me to get off my high horse because I had cheated too and I had no right.
And I.... Guess?
When I was 17 I was with this boy for 3 months. I went to a party got shit faced and made out with a classmate for a total of 10 minutes. I felt so bad that I called my boyfriend crying and we talked it out. We broke up. I told my dad and In 10 years I never did something like that again. I have been with my partner for 5 years.
I told him he could not equate it at all. He called me a hypocrite. And that he was glad to know who I am.

Driving home I felt like I was a bit harsh. He is still my father and he is not a bad father. I just don't want to be in his wedding. I would still go. But AITA,?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to be my best friend's best man?
content: My (M27) best friend Ben (M28) is getting married to his fiancée Flora (M30) in September 2023. He proposed to her last month.

I've known Ben since high school. We both had a tough childhood and we helped each other get through it. He's like a brother I never had. Flora is great. We get along well. I'm glad Ben is with her. They make a great couple, I hope they'll last.

But I don't give a f\* about their wedding. It's not personal. I don't care about any wedding. I think getting married is dumb and meaningless. When it goes well, it doesn't change anything from before you were married, and when it goes wrong, it ruins your life.

Ben knows how I feel about marriage and weddings. He knows I avoid anything related to it, because I don't like it. We already had some friends gettings married, and I only attended when they agreed I wouldn't have to do anything except be there. Otherwise, I declined.

So imagine my surprise when Ben invited me for a night out, and asked me to be his best man. He had a whole speech prepared to convince me. He said he knew how I felt about marriage, but he thought his wedding would be special to me. He told me he couldn't imagine anyone but me as his best man.

I looked at him, asked him if he was serious, and I said no. I said I was planning to attend and buy them a gift, and that was good enough for me. He insisted, told me to think about it, how much it would mean to him, that it wasn't a big deal as I thought it was. So I told him to let it go, or I wouldn't even attend.

He got mad, called me a jerk and left. It was 10 days ago. I haven't talked to him since. He doesn't answer my texts, or in the group chat we have (we're part of a solid group of friends from high school). Our friends are mainly on his side, even though they understand where I'm coming from. They think I should suck it up and just do it for Ben. They told me Ben was really mad at me, and that I could lose him over it.

I really don't want to take part in something I despise, and I know Ben. We've had arguments, didn't talk for months before, but we always make up. I have no doubt we'll stay friends. It's not like I'm trying to prevent him from getting married.

AITA?

Edit: I wrote a comment to explain why I feel that way about marriage. I apologized to Ben for how I reacted but I still don't intend to be his best man. We're good though. ",yta
"title: AITA for refusing to buy a different meal for a client at the shelter I work at?
content: I work at a sober living facility. There are about twelve people living there right now. The house charges rent to live there, but offers a sober environment for people recovering. I am not a therapist or social worker. I am there to supervise and drive people with DUIs to appointments. We have a company car.

I am told by my boss not to offer to buy people things. They have jobs. The house provides staples like shampoo and other items. I do not spend a dime of my pay on people living here.

My brother went to the same facility a few years back. He said it changed his life. So he has offered to provide wings and pizza for everyone once a month. He works at a pizza parlor so this is something he worked out with his boss, who was his sponsor in AA.  

We recently got a new client, Alberta (34F), who hates pizza. She got upset that I brought pizza + wings and nothing else. She asked if my brother would provide another type of food. She wants me to bring her something else on the night the pizza is there. I told her this was not happening. 

She approached me another time. She said she feels like I hate her because I won't change the meal provided during our movie night.  

Alberta: It is not fair to feed \[the clients\] and not me. 

Me: That is not happening. This is an offered treat. You work, you can order yourself something else.

Alberta: I feel left out. 

Me: The offer is free pizza. If you don't like pizza, then you don't like pizza. Don't ask me again to buy you food. 

Alberta: It makes me feel like no one wants me around.

Me: When you have a bad attitude, most people don't want you around. 

Alberta: You can't talk to me like that.

Me: Don't ask about the pizza again. It is what it is and you cannot decide what is donated or not.

"title: AITA for refusing to dye my daughter’s hair because her school complained?
content: My daughter(15F) dyed her hair dark reddish brown for her birthday.I didn’t let her dye her hair in middle school but said she could in high school. The school has a dress code for hair that just specified “natural hair colors only”. Which I took to mean browns, blondes, reds, black etc basically natural tones. Her natural hair is black but I don’t think it’s much of a change. The hairdresser that did a bleaching on her hair said it was not lighten enough to cause significant damage. 

But then one of the teachers in the beginning of the oct last year began complaining to me during parent teacher meetings that her hair didn’t meet dress code. I said her hair color grew out of people’s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter’s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it’s pretty racist to say she can’t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks “natural”. 

This went on until the end of the school year. I contacted the superintendent several times but she never got back to me. It’s almost the start of school again and I get an email from the principle reminding me my daughter is only allowed black hair. She still has her reddish brown hair and doesn’t want to dye it back. But I’ve tried to fight it and the last thing to do is to barge into the superintendents office and demand she get involved.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to get in the car with my mom?
content: I'm (28F) 33 weeks pregnant, high-risk, and on modified bed-rest. I can still do moderate exercise and run errands but mostly I'm meant to be sitting with my feet up all day so I don't get sick again.

My doctor okay-ed me to continue doing my mile-walks so my mom and I went up to our local park that has a walking path. She drove her car.

We got about 1/8 mile from the car and I mentioned thinking of changing the name I'd picked for the baby. Its been a point of consternation between she and I. I had settled on a name but in the last couple weeks it began to feel like the wrong name. I've been trying out a few names. She's frustrated by my inability to pick one.

Anyway, I mentioned this wanting to change the name and she had a visceral reaction. She growled, threw her hands in the air, yelled a curse, and turned around and started storming off. I didn't realize what she was doing so I just stood there and watched. I thought she was going to turn and come baback. Instead she stormed to the car, got in, and drove away. Even if I had realize what she was doing I couldn't have caught up with her, I can only waddle these days.

I walked back to the parking lot thinking she was coming back and just messing with me but five minutes passed and she was still gone. My leggings don't have pockets so I didn't have my cellphone with me.

I went inside the community center and fortunately there were some ladies setting up for something and I asked if I could borrow a cellphone. I figured my mom wouldn't answer so I called my grandfather, who lives 10 minutes from the park. He said he'd be right there to get me. 

About the time my granddad parked my mom pulled back into the lot. She asked me why I called my grandfather instead of her and I told her that she left me in a park, without a cellphone so I borrowed someone's and called the only number I had memorized that I knew would pick me up.

Mom told my granddad she was sorry we'd bothered him and that she'd take me home. I told her I wasn't getting in the car with her and she was crazy if she thought I was. She asked why and I told her, ""you left your 8.5 month high-risk pregnant child in a park without a cellphone on an 85 degree F day, over something as stupid as naming a baby that isn't even due for another 7 weeks. She won't even know her own name for months, it literally doesn't even matter yet, but you let it become a whole drama.""

My granddad drove me home. He gave my mom a stern talking-to when we got there.

Mom is now walking around acting like she's the victim because I embarrassed her. She said I should have just got in the car with her. She's only offered a half-assed apology but it was more of a, ""sorry you feel the way you do"" apology and not a real one.

She says I'm overreacting. I'm writing this with the intent of showing her so I'll accept whatever judgement comes my way. If I overreacted I want to know it.

Edit: she didn't know I didn't have my phone.

"title: AITA for refusing to get involved in my sister and BIL’s argument?
content: I (27f) have a sister, Amy (31f). Amy and her husband Bob (33m) have been having marital issues for a while now mostly due to Bob’s job. He has a high profile and demanding job in our area and he often works so much that he’s never really home all that much. It’s been like this for around 3 years now. This is a problem not only for their marriage in general but also because they have my wonderful nieces who are triplets (all 4f). 

I moved in with them after my undergrad 2 years ago because I was going to grad school in their city and my sister really wanted me to live with them, and my BIL agreed. He was already gone most of the time by this point and so I naturally helped my sister out a lot with childcare. This continued even after I got a job and started a phd. I do a lot of babysitting, bath times, mealtimes and bedtimes and they recently started school so Amy and I share taking them to school. Sometimes I feel like Amy and I are parents and Bob is more like that uncle who occasionally visits. But when he’s home they always fight and a few months ago they decided to trial separate. They still live together, though in separate rooms. If I’m honest it feels like not much is different. 

A few days ago Bob did make it home for dinner, and when he came home I was sitting at the table talking to them when one of the girls handed me a letter from the school detailing an upcoming parent’s information evening and asked Amy if I would be going too, Amy didn’t reply because one of the other girls asked which story I would be reading for bedtime. Bob overheard everything.

He waited til the girls were asleep and blew up at Amy. How dare she let me have such an active part in parenting the kids etc. and she blew up back she wouldn’t need help parenting if he were there etc. They both tried to get me involved, and asked me if I had a side. I said while I do (Amy) I think that it’s something that was better talked about when the girls were gone and they were calmer, and suggested talking about it the next day. Bob is upset about the whole thing, and Amy is hurt I didn’t side with her immediately because she knows I agree. Idk what to do here. AITA?

ETA: I think it should be made clear that I obviously won’t be going to the parent thing, as I’m not a parent. And that my nieces know I’m not their mother, I’m their aunt. They’re just used to Bob not being there and Amy and I doing lots of things with them.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?
content: For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. 

I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. 

Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. 

Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",yta
"title: AITA for refusing to give my sis the hotel room key?
content: Apologies for format and whatever, I’m on mobile. 

To get straight to it me (22F) and my sister (27?F) are on vacation at a popular theme park that has hotels you can stay at to have early entry, etc. She paid for this trip as a birthday gift to me and while I’m very grateful for that, I knew it came with strings. 

First, she pushed me over and over to buy things I can’t afford. Drinks, food, souvenirs, add ons, tshirts, etc. I’m a poor graduate student and finally had to put my foot down about purchasing things, which made her pouty/upset at me multiple times. I shrugged this off as she had paid for my trip. Then she made me the pack mule for all of our days at the park—I carried all our IDs, cards, tickets, and anything we bought. This would be fine if she wasn’t demanding I get things out at the speed of light and then groping me to open up the fanny pack strapped across my chest if I wasn’t fast enough. She snapped at me over this multiple times. On top of that, I was expected to only do the rides/attractions she was interested in. Otherwise I’d have to ride alone, which would also be fine if she didn’t become passive aggressive about having to wait for me. In the end, I just went along with her because she did pay for everything and I’m not uber into the themes of the park, it wasn’t a huge deal to me not to choose things. 

But this all came to a head about an hour ago. I got off a ride she hadn’t wanted to get on and met her in one of the bars/restaurants. We decided to go on a specific ride, but since she had just finished her beer she wanted to sit for a minute. She was wishy washy about what she wanted to do during this break, changing the plan a few times. I said okay to the first two ideas, but after the third, I (admittedly) did get whiny about not wanting to walk halfway across the park to the other place she wanted to go. She snapped at me and asked what I wanted to do. I replied that I wanted to ride the roller coaster we talked about at the beginning, but not if she was going to act bratty about it. 

This set her off and she went on a rant about how she paid for the trip and that I needed to calm down. I responded that we’ve been doing whatever she wanted for the past two days, which made her angry. She decided to leave me alone in the park (this is my first time here) but not before chasing me down the street to get her ID and credit card from me. I gave her the ID when she demanded I give her the room key for the hotel. I said she could have her ID and cards, but that I was keeping the room key. It’s the only one we have and you need it to do certain things in the park. She demanded it and kept following me until I told her to f*** off and threw her card on the ground. This is where I’m probably the asshole.

Anyway, after that she finally left me alone and eventually she went back to our hotel, leaving me in the park alone. I’m planning on spending the remainder of the day doing the things I actually wanted to do. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for refusing to give this woman her grandma's wedding dress and jewelry back?
content: I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8"", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

Now she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to give up my Neopets account to my niece?
content: Throwaway account.

Ok so I'm upset and confused and I told Sister/BIL I would post here to settle this argument, so they will be seeing and reading this.

For those who don't know Neopets is a virtual pet game site that was really popular around the late 90s/early 2000s. It kind of died a bit for a while but has recently started to get popular again. I have been playing for years. My account is 18 years old and it has the stats to reflect that (pets/avatars/stamps/gallery/trophies etc.). If you don't play it may not mean alot and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.

I 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(

I recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).

Anyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.

Well he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.

I feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up like this, much less make the front page! Thank you everyone for your responses (and for the reward/coins OMG). I promise I'm reading all of them and I'm making sure my family has the link so they can read them too. Hopefully we can have a civil conversation about it after reading all this. I have a nice NC background I know my niece will love I plan on sending her for her birthday.

They also took over our beds and we would be screamed at if we told them to get down so we could sleep (not only dogs but they had goats/rabbits/chickens indoors at night). Fast forward to age 16, I move out and end up with a guy who was the exact same way. Forcing me to sleep on the floor while pregnant so his old dog could be comfortable (we were young, broke and didn't have a couch). Or him getting his dog treats/toys versus our kid medication he needed. When that dog died he immediately got another and the cycle continued until I left (at 23). As I said, stupid luck. But regardless, this put a very bad taste in my mouth when it came to all animals, dogs especially.

My mother still has a bunch of dogs (5) and they still completely overtake her house. She has 3 couches and no where else to sit and those couches are basically the dogs domain. If the dogs are laying down, we all have to stand. She still has other animals indoors as well (goats and rabbits). Her dogs also have zero boundaries. If you are sitting, they will come over and get on top of you. My in laws are the same. SIL has 4 dogs and SIL is very much a ""it's their house"" type. So if the dog rips food out of the kids hands? Oh well, kid shouldn't of had food down low enough. Dog jumps on you? Deal with it, it's their house, not yours. Same with MIL, who only has 1 dog but he's huge and wildly untrained. Barreling through the kids constantly and jumping on me. MIL just laughs it off. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and he's knocked me down several times. 

Probably about 2 months ago I grew extremely resentful of all these people (my mom, MIL and SIL) and decided I would no longer associate because they treat me, my husband and my kids like 2nd class citizens in comparison to their dogs. I cut all contact basically, though I didn't block them. Just started ignoring calls. Over the past month my mom and MIL have invited me and the kids over and I've refused. When my husband asked why, I reiterated that I'm not going anywhere near them or their dogs. I'm all set. He said I'm being an AH because it's not like we have to deal with it for too long and could just stay a couple hours. I still refuse. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to go to my SIL’s wedding?
content: AITA for refusing to go to my SIL wedding?

I (24f) have been with my boyfriend for 5 years. His sister (22f) is a trans woman who came out about 4 years ago. I am a super girly girl, I have pink nails all the time and I style my hair and I’m always wearing makeup and dresses.
Anyways, my SIL is getting married in 2 weeks. Her fiancée is a beautiful woman and they’re a perfect match. Both of their style is very simple. Three weeks ago was their bridal shower. I wore a sage green slit dress, hair and makeup was super simple. When I got there, my SIL was very cold with me. Her fiancée complimented me and thanked me for helping with the planning. SIL barely said anything. I figured she was nervous and just stressed out, she has social anxiety. The shower was wonderful and it looked like they had a great time.
A week ago my SIL texts me, she asks me if I can send her what I was thinking to wear to the wedding. I send her a picture of the dress I bought. Then she asks if I would consider a jumpsuit. Not usually my style but I tell her I’ll look into it. I send her a cute one I found on Amazon again. She says no. I ask her what is she thinking I should wear. She sends me a loose jumpsuit that doesn’t even look appropriate for a wedding. (Background: I am a Latina who is only 5’ tall. My waist is small, I have D size boobs, and a really big butt. When I was a kid my mom would put me in oversized clothes to hide my body and it gave me body dysmorphia and an ED). 
When I see the jumpsuit I realize that she wants me to not “show my body off.” I hate it but I can compromise. I send her a dress that tbh is not flattering to my body type at all but it’s still pretty and I can make it work. She rejects it then calls me to go off about how I’m trying to upstage her at her own wedding. I told her I’m trying to find a middle ground that doesn’t require either of us being extremely uncomfortable. She and I argue a bit on what is appropriate until finally she says “it’s my day and I decide what goes.” 
Then it clicked for me, she’s right I can’t argue with her about her day. So I tell her that I am not going to the be attending. She can set her boundaries and I either can follow them or not be in the situation. So that’s what I choose. I will not be in a situation that is uncomfortable but I’m not going to have her compromise for her own wedding.
She hangs up and calls my boyfriend crying to him. He’s at work during all of this so he’s confused. I send him the screenshots. He agrees that we were at a standoff so someone had to give. Now that he agreed with me, she has been crying to her family telling them how horrible I am for trying to always upstage her even at her wedding. Am I really the asshole? Should I apologize and wear the ugly romper?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to help my partner financially?
content: I(43F) have been with my partner(50M) for 6 years now. We have been living together for 5 of them. We are not married and we do not plan to marry in the future.

I have a son(19M) that is currently a highschool senior. My partner has a daughter(21F) who is going to college.

The background you need to understand the issue: when I met my partner I was a widow of 3 years. I am lucky enough to have a very lucrative business and some family money. Also my late husband left a substantial estate, including the house we live in. The house is a family home so it passed to my son as the only heir.
My partner also makes good money and the difference in our lifestyles was pretty much negligible.

But while I and my late husband made sure to not spoil our son (he was responsible for keeping his room clean even though we have a house keeper, he had chores during the weekends, we taught him how to cook, his allowance is reasonable, he has to save for expensive purchases like a car, a PS5...etc). My current partner and his ex-wife spoil their daughter rotten.

Due to an incident when we first moved in together (she demanded my son's bedroom since it was the second biggest, got rejected since it was his home and she only spends the weekend), and after some family therapy we agreed that she will be treated like a guest by me. She will have to follow the house rules and that it the extent of our relationship.

Now while she is spoiled she is a good girl, academically excellent, except for the aforementioned incident very respectful and just a pleasant young woman.

The probelm is that I did not know the extent to which my partner spent money on her. He pays some money as ""rent"" that I put into my son's college fund and we split the common bills in half. Everything else is our own responsibility so we don't know much about each other's finances.

Now my son is planning to do a tour of east Asia during the summer and I was happy to give him the money to do so (as a gift for getting into a very prestigious college). When my stepdaughter heard about it she asked her dad to pay for a tour of Europe since he didn't send her on one after she got into college.

He agreed because he never says no, but he came to me asking me to lend him close to $30k because he can't afford the trip on his own. I am not even giving that much to my son and his plane tickets are more expensive.

I refused. I said that since this wasn't an emergency he can save and send her on the trip after she graduates college. Now he is not talking to me, saying that I am chosing favourites (I have no relationship with his daughter so I don't know how that even is applicable) and that I am putting money over his happiness and relationship with his daughter.

So AITA? I can easily afford to lend him the full amount I just don't want to, because his reasons are not convincing enough.",info
"title: AITA for refusing to help my sister with homework?
content: This evening, my (17F) dad (40M) called me to the living room to tell me to help my sister (7F) do her homework. I loathe helping my little sister do homework as she gets distracted, angry, and sassy with me saying she doesn’t want to do it. 

I told my dad why couldn’t he help her for once as I was busy just getting out of an hr long school meeting and was doing homework. He said he was eating but as I was telling my sister to get off her iPad and get her homework out, he said forget it because I’m going to be in a bad mood. 

This isn’t the first time where my dad has tried to make me play mother for my sister, saying things such as “she acts this way because of you,” “is it that hard to just watch her while I nap?” since my sister is stressful at times when she doesn’t get what she wants. (i.e. iPad all day, having to do homework, not getting a toy, etc) I’ve tried to set boundaries for her put dad keeps making it my fault.  

Now this is where I feel like I may be TA because my dad seemed to just want to relax and eat but it’s been too many times he’s pushed parental duties on me. (giving sister a bath at seven years old, doing her hw, cleaning her room, etc.) 

I’m also afraid I may be TA because I don’t want my sister thinking I hate her since she is so young and sensitive to certain words.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to help my step sister with her house purchase and telling her and my step father that it's because of how they treated me as a child?
content: I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",nta

"title: AITA for refusing to indulge my mother's horoscopes?
content: Me (20F) and my mom (48F) have always had a fraught relationship, but I wanted to preserve some good memories before I leave. Hence, taking an interest in some of her hobbies, including very spiritual stuff.

I have no issue with her participation in daily rituals. What drives me up the wall is when she would ALWAYS, without fail, find the days where my horoscope was apparently 'bad' (seriously, I have no idea how websites come up with these things and how I always seem to get a bad read) and proceeds to **lecture me about it**. No regard whatsoever for what I was feeling (often stressed out from work/school) or what I was doing, she had to say it.

She seems to particularly enjoy telling me 'bad horoscopes' on days when I either have something very important coming up. Just a casual *'Oh your luck is really low today'* or *'Your work quality is only 20%'* right as I was going out the door to a very important interview.

Whenever I snap back, she would simply say *'You should be thanking me for letting you know'*. The thing is, I didn't ask for it and never did, if I had wanted to I would simply consult the site myself. What's more, she never provides me with any advice. It's simply just a vague ominous fact. It's as if Fate has already determined I'm going to have an absolutely shitty day no matter how hard I try.

While I recognize it's a bit petty of me, I am in a period of my life where my mental health isn't faring very well, and even if I am not technically 'superstitious' or 'spiritual', I don't need the added weight of feeling like some unseen force was out to get me. It gets worse because she declines to mention anything good, not even to cheer me up or help me regain optimism for a new day. 

I am out of ideas. We fight every day over some petty horoscope on a rag mag, and I can't be more fed up and miserable. I really don't want the catalyst to end our relationship entirely to be a bunch of vague omens but so far there seems to be nothing I can do. No amount of explanations will go through to her, not even when the entire family saw me break down after she walked in and announced *'You have no luck today, don't even hope'* right after I submitted an application to my dream job. It's not so much the horoscopes themselves but the fact that she doesn't seem to notice or choose to actively ignore the distress she causes, and her steadfast belief in them to a disturbing degree.

I recently told her that if she was going to continue with that habit then I can not bring myself to converse with her any longer, because I don't want to constantly hear a stream of prophecies about how shitty my life is. She threw a tantrum and claimed she is teaching me the ways of the world (through random horoscopes from a showbiz-centered online site, apparently). I didn't reply and proceeded to block her number.

"title: AITA for refusing to let my future husband lie about the house he and I purchased during his 'groom speech'?
content: 
My fiancè (37M) and I (33F) got engaged few months ago. We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.


My fiancè sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's ""just a confidence boost"" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.

He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?

[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",nta

I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.

My mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.

I met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care.

But recently, I began to notice that he was very lazy. To give you an idea of how lazy he is, when we eat dinner together, he'd ask us to pour him a cup of juice *with the juice and cup right in front of him*.

I taught him before how to make him tea so he knows how to. I decided that I would not take any requests for things that he can easily do himself (e.g. pour him juice, make him tea). I'd only do those if he was rlly unable to do so himself for wtv reason (e.g. he is sick) or its smth that he rlly cant do smth himself. Once he proves that he is not lazy and is willing to do things himself, then mb I will start taking more of his requests.

This morning, he asked me to make him tea when I came to the kitchen for breakfast. I said no because he needs to learn to do things himself. I told him I'd no longer enable him and start getting him to do things himself. He started to make bad excuses (e.g. he claimed his hands are not working while playing on his phone) and claimed that I wouldve made him the tea if I cared about him.

He eventually started calling for mom to make him tea, and she got angry because he woke her up and she didnt have enough sleep. My dad calmed her down and made my brother tea.

We had an agreement that we wouldn’t talk about names until we knew the gender, so of course on our way home from the gynecologist, we immediately started discussing. We’ve talked about this a little before, and we agreed that we both have veto power. I suggested my all time favorite name, Anna. My wife suggested Caeleigh (pronounced Kailey, and yes she spelled it out). I vetoed it. 

She suggested another name, Ryleigh (Riley, and again she did spell it out). I vetoed it and suggested Riley spelled the normal way. She refused. 

She then suggested Novalynn. I vetoed, suggesting Nora as an alternative. She again refused.

"title: AITA for refusing to pay for girl’s wig after she shaved it because of me?
content: There’s this girl that lives in my uni halls, we’re not roommates but we are flatmates. Let’s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We’re not best friends but we are friendly. We don’t really spend much time together.  


Over time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn’t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don’t owe the style and she’s free to wear what she likes but it’s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.


But then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I’d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. 
I joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. 
Basically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It’s just really creepy but I haven’t said anything, I wouldn’t even know what to say.

Over the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.

I deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it’s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.
She kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it’s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she’s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?",nta

He will get married soon and has recently become a Protestant, like his future wife. They attend many religious events together and sing / play Christian songs and Christian music with other people from Church.

He has asked me if I would agree to play the drums on religious songs during his wedding with other people from Church.

I understand some people need religions, that they can have a positive effect on them, I respect that, but I am an Atheist and not having a religion is important to me.

So I didn't accept to play the drums with this religious band, that would require me to work on 4-5 songs which music I don't like with lyrics I don't agree with. I wouldn't feel at ease.

He's not mad at me but he insists, so I was wondering what you guys think.

AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: I actually should have made it clear that this implied me learning these songs, by listening to them many times + practicing at home by myself before practicing with the Christian band a few times before the wedding. Not just going to the church and randomly hitting the drums! Or it would have sounded like this: [https://youtu.be/auLz3ssCsdg](https://youtu.be/auLz3ssCsdg) (this one never gets old!!)

"title: AITA for refusing to put my weight loss progress photos behind a black screen?
content: I worked my ass off over the last three years to lose 120 lbs, and I look and feel amazing. I have been obese for almost my whole childhood and all of my adulthood, and it feels almost like life has finally begun.

I posted my before and after to Facebook because I'm a dinosaur at heart, and got a message shortly after from ""Len,"" my friend's girlfriend. Len is over 300 lbs, which...I mean, I don't recommend it, but if that's your choice then whatever. She's also claims that she's an atypical anorexic who gains weight because she only eats 500 calories a day. That is blatantly not true, but not my circus/monkeys.

Len said that it was very inappropriate to post a weight loss before/after without a warning because it could cause a relapse in people with EDs, and that if I absolutely had to post it I should make it an album with a black cover photo and a warning so that people would have to click through to see the actual photo. The message also contained a long and unscientific rant about my personal choices that is not super relevant here, but didn't do much to get me in the mood to make these accommodations. So I told her that I was going to go ahead and post whatever I wanted to my own personal Facebook, and if she didn't like seeing it she should probably go ahead and unfollow me.

I guess that was a declaration of war because she absolutely blew up at me and dragged her gf/my friend into the mix, along with some other mutual friends, and it's a big chaos of ""It's no big deal to just hide the photo, [me]"" vs. ""It's no big deal to just unfollow her, Len.""",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to sell my horse?
content: Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. 

I’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.

When I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. 

At first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.

Then last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. 

So I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?

Edit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I’m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️

"title: AITA for refusing to share a room with a 1yr old, twin 2yr olds and a 4yr old?
content: So I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle’s (I’ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the “kids room” which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They’ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.

The other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I’ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.

H’s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I’ve been to their house before, it’s horrible). 

Anyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G’s shared one).

I was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.

Cue a MASSIVE explosion.

The baby cannons are pissed that I don’t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he’s a “growing boy” and he “doesn’t know how to take care of kids”.

None of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn’t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.

Cue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can’t stay. At this point, I’m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do.

So I tell them I’m leaving.
Cue more screaming.
I drove up my father’s boat, if I leave, there’s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.

I say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we’re leaving.

Well, baby cannons weren’t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.

Now I’m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I’m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. 

AITA here?

UPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to share clothes with my brother?
content: Hi, Im 18, Male. I apologize in advance if my English isn't great it's my 3rd language.

Growing up it was a tradition that whenever any of my clothes got slightly tight that they would be passed on to my brother. It was not even on a fair level either because if he asked for anything he got it and if I did it was basically ignored. This was not limited to clothing this was for everything, sometimes he would even break my stuff or bully me for the sake of it and my mom would still stand by his side and tell me I'm in the wrong. Ofcourse, she would immediately deny this if you asked her today but it was so often so to the extent that we came up with a name for it, the ""mommy privilege"". This was your typical ""I don't have a favorite child"" scenario where I was always treated harsher, expected more of and shown less compassion or love growing up, and even though I always achieved higher and acted better, who cared as long as I was me?

Now my brother is 15 and I am 18, there is a clear difference in height between us and a clear one in posture too as I go to the gym and train and am already tall while he is well, neither of these. We share a closet together, which is something that since the beginning was against my will (because I knew this would happen). My brother has almost the entire closet, the drawers are all used up by his clothes, the rows are all except a half of one are his and yet, he does not share any of it with me. He does not respect boundaries, it is not that my family does not understand personal boundaries, they all expect their personal spaces to be respected but when I ask the same of them it's an issue and I'm being a nuisance. So he starts wearing my clothes and obviously I get mad cuz like he has 50+ shirts and 20+ pants and I only have like 15 combined, and what he says to me is absolutely mind baffling. ""Mom took half of your stuff and gave it to me so it's not yours anymore"".

I'm sorry, what the \*\*\*\*?? The shirt he is wearing in particular is a birthday gift I got in the summer of 2021 and yet somehow in a few weeks of me being distracted by exam preparation (I'm a highschool senior) he managed to destroy it. I used this shirt for 2 years and kept it clean and intact and he manages to do this in 2 weeks. Very obviously, I refuse to share my things with him, I refuse to share my clothes with him and the only reason I'm even putting up with this bs from my family is the hope I'm going to have my own place soon and move out. So I talk to my mom and her solution after throwing a tantrum is ""I'll let him share YOUR clothes with you"".... I have no comment.

I refuse, and state that I don't want to share my clothes and that he already has the variety he needs he has enough clothes to open his own store and he's coming for my stuff? The funny part is the clothes she left me (8) are all either ones of which he has better duplicates or 2 which are my school uniforms. I state out loud that I'm not sharing and now the entire house is mad at me for no reason.  
So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to split my inheritance with my siblings?
content: I’ll try to summarize as much as possible. 

I (f19) have an estranged grandpa more or less. He’s my dad’s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. I have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). My grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn’t see him. 

When he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. He’d stay for a week at a time and then go home. He was an old, bitter man to be honest. He never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he’d had his whole life. 

He wasn’t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I’ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. 

I was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. 

He died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with the money, but I’m going to save it. 

My dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can’t do it. 

My dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. 

As far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he’s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. 

My little sister is the only person I’ve actually considered. She’s very young and that’s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I’m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. 

But now my family is telling me I’m unfair and the money doesn’t belong to me and I’m not deserving of it. That I’m too young and I’ll waste it on cars and clothes. 

I don’t agree and now they’re all threatening to cut me off and never speak to me, or even sue me if I don’t give them all a chunk of the money. I don’t know what to do and I’m buckling under pressure here. I’ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming I stole the money from him. Everything was through an attorney, I know I did nothing wrong legally.. but morally? Idk. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to tutor the kids I babysat because their mother was ungrateful?
content: I (23f) was a babysitter. I worked as a babysitter to three kids (8m), (7m), (3f). I literally raised the two younger ones from newborns to toddlers since their parents were busy with work.

I help the oldest kid with his assignments. His mother shared her worries regarding the oldest way back years ago. He wasn't good at reading. Of course, as someone who raised the kids as if they're my own, I took an initiative. I taught the kid how to read properly and even introduced him to reading short stories (I love reading so I feel like he's gonna miss out a lot if he didn't give reading a chance). Months and years have gone by and I am still helping the oldest kid with homeworks. I don't expect any incentive by doing so. I was happy to spend time with the kids because I bonded with them over the years.

Fast forward to last year. I brought up about how difficult it was to teach the oldest kid to read and reminisced it with the kid's mother, hoping that she'll share my enthusiasm over the nistalgic events especially her son grew to love reading because of my suggestion years ago. The mother then proceeded to gaslight me and told me that he learned reading from school and totally acted like she didn't remember my helping her oldest kid to read.

To be clear, I was totally happy to teach the kid without additional payment. I didn't even ask for a raise even if I was babysitting her kids for years. All I needed was a ""thank you"". A sign of appreciation. Maybe a mug or a shirt. Any token of appreciation at all. But nothing. I got nothing. No sign of appreciation. No anything.

I had enough. I stopped tutoring the kid and I evaded her vague requests about tutoring the middle child, too. I simply gave up and informed them that I will stop babysitting her kids anymore. I feel bad about my reaction towards the matter and I feel like I'm including the kids in my anger towards their mother. I love the kids so much and will always take an extra mile for them, but I just can't bear the toxicity of their mother that's why I left for good and never came back. AITA?

P.S. I didn't cut my contact with the kids, though. I am still playing with her kids on Roblox. Connecting with the kids is like connecting with my inner child since I spent most of my teen years working to support my education. I hope nobody misinterpret my connection with the children. I always loved taking care of kids, even playing with them on Roblox or PS5. Lol.

Edit: Just to clarify, I taught the kid how to read the whole summer. It is my fault for being humble with my words and didn't include the entire process since it might bore some.

The kid didn't know his letters. He confuses his small  letter ""b"" with ""d"". Yeah. He was at that level when I taught him how to read. He only knows ten letters and sometimes confuses them with one another. I taught him to recognize the letters until we got to the level where he could read ""ascertain"" without doubting himself if he read it right. It was not a big deal to me. He is a fast learner himself so he learned pretty fast. In just a few months, he can read the menus and stuff on youtube. I was proud. I was happy that the toddler I met years ago was finally learning how to read. It was fulfilling.

The issue here is how his mother gaslighted me and shrugged my contribution off as if they were nothing.

I was upset, yes. She neglected my efforts like they were nothing. That resulted to pettiness. I refused to tutor the middle child because of that. I even resigned. I was so upset because as someone who's being underappreciated their whole life, that sh*t stings.",yta
"title: AITA for refusing to use personal hygiene products despite my GF's protests?
content: My GF (26F) and I (30M) have been talking about this for a while and it's been an amicable discussion as much as it can be at this point.

Essentially, it does sound as bad as the title admittedly because ever since I was little (think early elementary school days), I've had an extremely odd revulsion towards any sort of artificial product. Artificial in this sense doesn't mean whether or not the ingredients are natural or not but basically anything made and sold for cleaning purposes, regardless of whether it's for personal hygiene or household cleaning. Think anything like toothpaste, bodywash, deodorant, clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. I physically gag and am on the verge of throwing up with any toothpaste for example (regardless of the flavor, taste, etc.) and I have to hold my nose if forced to use any products. Smelling anything of the sort usually makes me extremely uncomfortable and I've thrown up when exposed to them for extended periods of time.

Trust me when I say I do understand how unreasonable it sounds on the surface but to provide some context, I personally consider myself a very clean person - I shower usually twice a day on average, wash my hands thoroughly (with water) for 20-30 seconds each time, clean and vaccuum very often, etc. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I do make sure to be as clean as I can, just not with products, so basically everything is done with water. For further context and for what it's worth, I have never in my entire life had any comments on me being smelly or anything of the sort; I also barely get sick with my conscious efforts to promote cleanliness (knock on wood). 

My gf also does admit to me always been very clean and not smelling ever. But as you can probably guess, she simply can't wrap her head around and accept the fact that I simply refuse to use any of the aforementioned products. 

AITA in this case?",yta
"title: AITA for refusing to watch my sister's stepkid and exposing her lies to her husband?
content: 

My f/21 sister Jess, f/30, is married and has a 5 yo stepson. her husband works full time and she is a sahm.


Every monday, she'd call my mom at 9am to get her to go over to her house and watch her stepkid for few hours, I live at home with my parents and so I've noticed this routine for weeks now.

Last week mom went out of town to visit some relatives, and yesterday (monday) at 9am my sister called asking me to come watch her stepkid for few hours because she had an important thing to do. I said no because I had to go study and also she does this every monday so clearly it wasn't important or urgent but she insisted it was, I told her sorry but no. She ended the call then I went to the university.


Hours later, I got a call from my brother in law asking where my sister was, I said I had no idea. he proceeded to tell me he just came home at 1pm and found his son by himself at the house. I was in shock that my sister left her stepkid by himself so she could go God knows where. I told him about the conversation I had with her and he got angry.

In the evening my sister came over and started making a scene by yelling at me for bailing on her after she sent me a text message telling me she was already out the house to force me to come watch her stepson. I didn't see the fb message til she told me but she said I did this deliberately and also, exposed her to her husband because she told him she'd be at home with the kid. Not just that, but I also told her husband that mom comes over every monday morning to watch the kid for few hours which caused a huge fight between him and my sister. She yelled that I was petty and selfish and just stirred shit and caused issues in her marriage by tattling to her husband. I couldn't keep arguing I went into my room and started playing music. My dad and the others said I was to blame for not helping my sister and now being the reason she and her husband are in conflict.


AITA?

Okay guys so I saw few questions asked multiple times so I'll just put the answers out here for all to see.

1) My brother in law's wife is deceased.

2) brother in law is always at work when my sister calls my mom to get her to come over and watch her stepson.

3) most of you guys are asking where my sister goes every monday, and I even saw someone mention that I was YTA for not finding out, but I don't know anything, I have no idea what's going with my sister and I thought it was non of my business.


UPDATE: Guys! I've decided to try and find out what is really going with Jess. I'm not the type to snoop and it's not my business but she already made it my business by turning the family against me because of something she did. Ngl I came here thinking I was going to get toast but I wrong, thank goodness for that. I'll update as soon as possible. Thanks :)",nta
"title: AITA for rejecting the role of ""cool aunt"" because it was really more like unpaid babysitter?
content: My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.

I always felt kind of ""different"" from the others because I'm not very ""geeky"" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.

Well, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is ""Harry Potter"" themed.

Due to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.

Except the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said ""It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.""

I was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.

I said ""I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.""

She was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of ""chasing popularity and doing my nails"" maybe I would have more in common with them.

I'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were ""too advanced"" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were ""dumb books for vapid little girls.""

**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? ",nta
"title: AITA for removing the bedroom lock after my husband ignored a family emergency?
content: Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. 

He values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP"" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.


This past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.

"title: AITA for repeatedly asking a “friend” to pay me for easy work?
content: In September, I started doing poetry editing for this guy I had worked for before (I worked at his booth at a fair a few years ago). He refers to us as friends (he’s older and male, I’m a mid 20s female) which I don’t think we really are but whatever, he’s kind of eccentric. 

He approached me over email after we hadn’t spoken for years, asking me to do this editing, because he’s going to try to publish a poetry book, and I agreed. I did tell him I am sick with severe ME/CFS (to which he replied kindly), but we agreed that i could go at my own pace, and he said he would pay me $100 a month flat rate. Despite my illness, editing a few poems a month is still doable for me. I usually get the edits back to him within 1-4 days. 

We did some poems in September and October, and then nothing over November and December because of the holidays (so he paid me $200 total for Sept & Oct)

In January he emailed me saying “We are re starting the poems and I’m getting you back on $100 a month! No, $150 a month” and we began the poems again. We do about 3-4 poems per month, so honestly $150 is a lot of money for a small amount of work. 

He paid me for January and March, but never paid me for February. I felt shy about saying anything, but recently I decided to bring it up. 

A few days ago, at the beginning of May, when I was giving him feedback for his most recent poem he sent me (that same day) I emailed him, “Also, looking through my emails I see that we did 4 poems in February but I never received a payment for that month, and also April? Hope you don't mind me mentioning it.”

It’s clear in the above email that I am mentioning two months of payments, right? Which would be $300 total, right? 

Well, he then sent me $150, which is half of what he owes me. He replied “I just sent you $150 because you are a fantastic friend and co-conspirator of creativity.” 

Then he sent me another poem. 

I’m feeling weird about this because I had to step forward and ask to get paid, and then he sent me only half of what he owes me, and then he used what I feel is patronizing language, saying that he sent me the money because I’m a “fantastic friend” etc, as though he is doing me a favor by paying me for the work that I’ve done. 

But I’m also feeling conflicted because maybe he is kind of doing me a favor. Editing a few poems a month isn’t that difficult, and a flat rate of $150 a month is pretty good, so maybe I should just be quiet and accept what I’ve been given? I don’t know.",nta
"title: AITA for replying to a coworkers inappropriate texts by work email, and attaching them?
content: 
One of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. 

Asking me to come over and ""have some fun"" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)

He also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. 

When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like ""What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem"". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... 

And I included dealing with this fucker as a ""workday problem"" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. 

On Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:

 ""Hi 'Coworker'

I'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)

Please only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.

Additionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. 

- OP""

I didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. 

And he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? 

I screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying ""As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack."" 

He stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked ""Is this a work question?"" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? 

He walked off... 

I feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.

AITA for sending that email?

---

Edit... 

Looks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. 

I'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.

Edit 2... 

 I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. 

It's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? 

I do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.

Edit 3...

Holy shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. 

She just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. 

I asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.

I haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.

Edit 4...

He was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. 

I owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",nta
"title: AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?
content: My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

&#x200B;

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here?

"title: AITA for responding to someone who accused me of treating her like my GF?
content: Last year in college I (20 m) became friends with a girl (21 f) who I hung out with a lot. She said we should hang out after the semester ended and during the summer.

Spring semester ended in April, and I called her on May 1st. I got her voicemail, so I texted her. A day or so later I called her again, she answered, and we talked for a few minutes, but she was busy so we ended the call. The next day I texted her, asking her if she wanted to see a movie with a group of mutual friends from college. Then she sent me the follow text:

""Why are you treating me like I'm your girlfriend? I'm not your girlfriend.""

To which I responded: ""How am I treating you like my girlfriend? You were the one who said we should hang out over the summer, and like I said, it's with a group of people. Not one on one.""

Her: ""Stop harassing me. Just because I'm nice to you doesn't mean I want to date you.""

Me: ""I never did want to date you, but thanks for letting me know I dodged a bullet.""

Her: ""Typical nice guy asshole.""

She told what happened to one of our mutual friends. Even after I showed the friend our text, she (mutual friend) believed her side of the story and doesn't want anything to do with me.

Honestly, I can be socially awkward, so I'm not sure if I broke some unwritten social norm. I never implied I wanted to date her over the past two semesters, but I'm not sure if I may have unintentionally made her think otherwise?

So, AITA?

"title: AITA for returning home after I found out that my husband booked 1st class for him and his friend while I got economy?
content: 

My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled ""I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???"" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was ""royalty"" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I ""technically"" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

He (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.",nta
"title: AITA for revealing our net worth when my wife constantly says we are broke and making me look bad with money?
content: I (31M) have been with my wife (30F) for 10 years now and she always has had this habit of making me look bad with our finances. Whenever anything regarding spending money comes up she will always say how broke we are and she doesn't have the money to do this or buy that. The thing is we are doing well financially. We have decent jobs and combine our salary is roughly $125k/yr.

As of today our net worth is more than $1 million but less than 2. I had saved/invested a lot before getting married so I gave us a good head start. I control the finances/take the lead but we both agreed to living a very modest life. We both have our cars from college for example (Honda & Toyota). She knows everything about our finances because at least once a month I go over it with her every time I deposit money in our investment accounts or our kids college funds. For banking we have an emergency fund and I budget everything else to go straight into investments. We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.

A few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. 

The same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.

At a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. 

Now my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?

EDIT: Final update for now as we have a long weekend planned. Some key points I saw a lot of and wanted to give answers.

-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.

-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. 

-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.

-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. 

-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.

-I'll speak more with my wife about this. After reading posts I think she may not feel like its her money since she never saved much before we got engaged.",info

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents.

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

"title: AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth?
content: A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.

We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.

Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""

Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.

I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" 

Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""

If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for ruining my sister wedding?

the other day her MIL was visiting and started talking about her second son Jan how successful he is,  he's house etc, that he's in the right place in life to get married and have children and was thinking of having her son's wedding in the same day (its uncommon event but there's a few, and arranged marriage is very common here)
then out of the blue she said I'm available so how about she come back later tonight with Jan so we can get engaged because she doesn't have alot of time to look around for a good wife because the wedding IS THIS MONTH and she knows our family very well, like I'm some type of settlement i never felt so angry in my life and the worst of all my parents and Sab were there and didn't say anything, i joked it off (said he is not my type)and went to the kitchen
 my mom came and told me i was rude to leave like that and should be grateful that she wants me to be her DIL because my MOM think that i can't get anyone decent enough because I'm fat (I'm not that overweight just curvy i like my body) also said its time to get married because i will be finishing me degree the summer and they will not find a better family to TAKE ME IN better then them (they rich like old money rich) and then had the audacity to tell me I'm not better then my sister to be this picky and because your a more realistic person it shouldn't be a problem to get married like this, so i lose it and yelled  they can all f***k off and (MIL name) can go get some professional help because she need it.
and off course everyone heard it, few minutes later after i gone up to my room my sister come and told me i was the asshole for ruining her marriage and because of me she lost the love of her life because her MIL said she was really disappointed in how my parents raised me that she is reconsidering my sister Sab becoming her DIL.
So am i the asshole?? My family is not talking to me I'm also so angry i can't think right, i don't know if Sab talked with her fiance or not I'm just staying in my room for the time being, maybe they right and i shouldn't have yelled like that but i feel if i didn't do my engagement would have been few days .

"title: AITA for rushing home to get my sister's forgotten wedding veil, but giving up on bringing it to her?
content: My oldest sister Odette just got married at a venue that (with no traffic) is about two hours and fifteen minutes away. Odette planned to wear great-great grandma Mary's veil, which has a distinct lace pattern and is passed to only the eldest daughter. In our family it's considered good luck, heavily sentimental, and we have multiple bridal pictures of eldest daughters in the veil while standing with their mom and grandma.

&nbsp;

The bridal party and family met at Odette's house before driving to the venue. The veil had been in a garment bag, hung up in front of a closet door, but the door had been opened, the hanger fell off, and none of us missed it when we packed up. We made it to the venue by noon for the 4pm wedding. Odette realized the veil was missing and ran to me in a panic, insisting I needed to be the one to go find it: mom wouldn't drive fast enough, middle sister Constance was her MOH, and dad was dealing with setup.  I didn't think I could make it there and back, but Odette insisted and said that if needed we could stall the ceremony a little.

&nbsp;

I floored it but sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for almost two hours, Waze estimating I wouldn't be at her house until at least 2:45pm. I texted Odette that if I didn't turn around *now*, I wasn't going to make it. She texted back ""JUST GET IT HERE."" When I emphasized that I wouldn't make it for her wedding ceremony or reception if I didn't turn around, she said ""The photographer doesn't leave until 7, just get it here before then so mom, grandma, and I can take pictures."" I made it to her house on adrenaline, but it took me forever to find the veil and get on the road again.

&nbsp;

Odette's texts continued after the wedding ceremony and pictures. I was already exhausted, sitting in rush hour traffic, and upset that I'd missed the entire thing. After re-reading our texts they were all about Mary's veil. I realized that she didn't care at all about me being there, which upset me enough to turn around at 5:30pm, with an estimated arrival of 6:30pm and getting later. I texted Odette that I was sorry, but the veil was put up and the house key was in the flower pot. I woke up to a ton of angry texts from her accusing me of ruining her wedding and not trying hard enough to get back. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for saying I won’t coddle my infertile sister any more?
content: My sister “Julie” has tried to have a baby for 5 years. She had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. My heart hurts for her. However, one thing I don’t agree with is how my family has handled it. We’re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can’t come to family events that she’ll attend. She won’t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. 

I got pregnant last year. I told Julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. I said I understood. The first hurdle came with my baby shower. My MIL was throwing it. I didn’t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn’t have one period, “out of respect”. I said that was ridiculous. She didn’t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.

When my son was born, I posted a birth announcement on Facebook. My parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt Julie. I said she could just block or mute me. They said I should make the effort. Julie echoed that if I cared, I’d stop. I ended up blocking her just to save drama. 

My aunt’s 70th birthday party is next week. My husband and I planned to go, bringing our son. Julie called and asked if we were going. She then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. I said no. She doesn’t want to miss the party. My aunt is one of the few people who agree that Julie’s boundaries aren’t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn’t get to see him often. Julie got upset and started crying, saying that I was unfair. 

I finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? Would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she’s refused to give other people’s kids? Will her baby be allowed to attend events? She said that was different. I said no, I’m not coddling her anymore. My son exists, he’s family and he’s coming. She can decide if she wants to or not.

My parents yelled at me for being mean to Julie. They offered to pay for a sitter but I said no. It’s not even her house. AITA?",nta

My mom is having some health issues and will have to have a surgery and she will be out of work for two months. I will be home to take care of her over the summer and also will be sharing the room with my boyfriend. 

Now comes the area where I might be the asshole, my boyfriend is at risk of losing his job. He came to me and said he is going to ask my mom if it is okay for him to not pay rent the last two months he is living here if he does lose his job because he will be sharing the room with me and doesn’t use many things around the apartment. I told him that I think that’s a little unfair of him to ask because my mom has already supported him through a lot and I get it if maybe he doesn’t pay the full amount of rent but he should still help out because he’ll be living there still. 

He says I am the asshole because I am not on his side and that he wants to save that money for when we move in together in the fall.

"title: AITA for saying no to picking up my sons half sister from school?
content: I am a single mom of two boys ages 11 and 10. Their father and I divorced 5 years ago after I learned he was cheating on me. He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay ""friends"" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.

He married his affair partner. They had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. Last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.

What followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.

What I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.

But I guess part of me does feel bad for the child. My son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and I hate that for them.

"title: AITA for saying that my kids are not my “greatest accomplishment” and that I resent the assumption they are?
content: I love my kids, but they are not my everything. I had a whole lifetime before. I ran marathons, climbed mountains, wrote a novel that was published and did moderately successful in the 00s, and have a MFA in creative writing.

Chatting with some folks in the neighborhood, we got to talking about our greatest accomplishments. When it came to me, Tom said “Oh, well we know what your greatest accomplishment is, obviously. You have three beautiful, well-behaved children.”

I was honestly shocked, and I said no, that’s NOT my greatest accomplishment. He looked just as shocked, and I said what my greatest accomplishment is, and then said “And by the way, I resent the assumption that having kids is my greatest accomplishment. You have kids, why didn’t you say that?”

He said how he didn’t *birth* the kids, and how that’s a miracle of life and all that gag-me shit. I just rolled my eyes and said “Let’s not boil women down to their biological functions, kay?”

Jen, who has kids, chimed in and said “Well, my kids are my greatest accomplishment. I can’t imagine thinking anything else.”

Tom looked super smug, others including other moms chimed in. All of the moms agreed their kids were their greatest accomplishment.

I kind of stewed about it. After that, the woman who chimed in sent me a message asking me if I needed to talk to someone, and asked if I was depressed, because my statement was worrisome. She ended up reaching out to my husband to encourage me to get help, because it seems I’m unhappy being a mom and that puts my kids at risk.

Am I really the asshole here for thinking being a Mom isn’t the end all be all of my life? Like… wtf?

**Edit:** Why are people sending me chats instead of posting? Don't send me chats. I'm just going to ignore them. And no, AskGoblins, I don't want you to read my post on your shitty YouTube channel.

Also, Lucia-pacciola, who crossposted this to ""AmITheAngel"", my greatest accomplishment is actually climbing Kili and Denali the same summer I knocked off the final 14ers of the contiguous US states, with my now husband. But go off with thinking it's bad to be proud of having a MFA.",nta
"title: AITA for scaring my teenage brother by standing up to my dad?
content: For context, I (21F) am shortly moving abroad. I got into a fully funded program. I do however need my dad's help paying for the flight tickets and accomodation for a month. Which he happily offered to do months ago. 

Here's the deal. Whenever anything pisses my dad off, he threatens me and tells me he won't pay for anything and won't let me go. This happens very frequently. Recently, we went on a cruise. I usually don't go on family trips (haven't in 2 years) because my dad always picks arguments, but I was guilt tripped into going on this one. My brother (14M) and I shared one cabin, while my parents shared another. 4 days passed by without any conflict. On the last night though, my dad dropped in to check if we had packed up everything in our trunks. He found a pair of socks belonging to my brother near the bed. He immediately started yelling at him, saying that he's irresponsible and has no value for money. Then he turned to me and said I'm irresponsible too, and should have made sure my brother had packed properly, being the elder sister. I had spotted the socks earlier, and told my brother to pack them up, but he forgot in his excitement (there was a late night pool party for teens on the roof). I told my dad as much, but he wouldn't let go. He said I hadn't seen my responsibility through, and that I was careless. He couldn't let me go abroad if I was going to have this kind of attitude about responsibilities. 

He kept going on and on, yelling at me, and I tried to hold myself back. But I snapped at one point, and said that my education abroad had nothing to do with a pair of socks, and that he's just a control freak. This made him even more mad, and a huge argument ensued, with us both yelling back at each other. Now my brother is usually very calm, but this fight really freaked him out. He kept crying and begging me to stop yelling, but I couldn't and didn't. I feel shitty about it.

"title: AITA for screenshotting messages guys sent me and sending them to their mothers?
content: I'm an 18 year old girl who is in college atm. I've been getting bullied/harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and nsfw pictures that i'm sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail. I should have reported them or just blocked them but I had, had enough so I screenshot every message they'd sent me and found their mothers through their facebook pages and sent screenshots to them including an explanation of who I am and how their sons have been bothering me.

Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side. Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their Mothers and also how I don't know what their home life is like. 

Am I the asshole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?

Edit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.

Edit 2: also whoever reported me as worried about my current mental health...thanks? I mean i'm honestly good but thanks.",nta
"title: AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?
content: My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.

**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",nta
"title: AITA for securing my friend an art commission?
content: My(F30) friend Tammy (F33) is an artist. She has an art degree and has done some commission in the past but has since given up. She now works an office job. She expressed to me a few months ago that she wanted to get back into it but doesn't know where to start. I'm not exactly in the art world but I do work in performance art and know some people in the art world that I've done work for. I said I'll keep an eye out, see if anyone has anything I can recommend her for. 

Robert(M33), another friend of mine, announced a new project he's doing and he's looking for an artist to create a mascot for him. He didn't care about whether the artist is professional or amateur. He just wants something creative and good. So I recommended he give my friend a shot. He agreed to seeing her creation if she wants to give it a try. 

So I brought it up with Tammy and she was excited. She drew up a mascot quickly and submitted it to Robert. He loved it and commissioned her to do a full series of different poses and expressions. Tammy called me squealing and said her thank yous before starting work. 

The next week, she texted me and said Robert was breathing down her neck about the drawings. I asked her what she meant and she said he called her twice in a week asking about the progress of the mascot. She felt like she needed to get it doen yesterday and she didn't appreciate it. I called Robert to ask him about it and he said he was just looking for an update. I relayed that to Tammy and she said ""fine. I'll continue working."" 

Two weeks later, another friend (who is unrelated to this situation) sent me an email full of screenshots of Tammy blasting me in private DMs about how she hates Robert's mascot idea and how it's pissing her off but because ""my dear friend asked me to, I have to"". And how I was an asshole for accepting a commission for her when I knew she hates cartoony artwork. She talked about how she felt I was blinded by how much I like Robert that I can't see how much she'd suffering under his constant watching of her progress. 

Was I wrong to help her get a commission?",nta
"title: AITA for sending a video of me snorting a drug to my friends, which caused one of them to chastise me about it. Perspectives appreciated!
content: TL;DR at the bottom.

Sent a video of me snorting a line of my prescribed med (though they wouldn’t have known what it was) to our friend group chat, got chastised by a mate.

The group had to look after me bc of my mental health lately so I understand that was hard for them. They feel uneasy about me doing drugs (even though I’ve never done any apart from start this med this week) bc of my issues. But this guy messaged me and said “We don’t want to see you doing drugs. Don’t send us that shit again or I’ll call campus security.” I literally thought he was joking but he wasn’t.

Drugs are normal at uni. Like threatening to call campus security? Seems so unfair. I feel so bad bc I thought what I did was normal & acceptable at uni.

I explained “I hear you. Sorry. I won’t do it again. Please be empathetic as to why I’m doing it though. Just trying to help myself.” He just said “I don’t care, don’t show us” which makes me feel really bad. I didn’t expect it to upset/anger anyone.

I said “Can you elaborate about why me doing drugs isn’t ok with you guys, just so I understand.”

Him: “another time”

Me: “Open to that so long as I don’t just feel accused”

Him: “it’s not an accusation, you’ve literally done it”

I’m about talking with him in person, like I’ll feel accused or like I’ll be about to cry bc of his insensitive, accusatory & direct manner. 

I don’t get why he’s being so harsh instead of sounding understanding and kind but disagreeing. Like threatening to call security, wtf? He knows I’m just trying to help myself. He picked me up from the emergency department after I was there for my mental health last week. He knows I’m struggling.

He’s angry and isn’t making an effort to see my perspective or be sensitive to my situation.

He could have said “maybe don’t send us videos of that” instead of being so harsh and threatening. He said “You know how we feel about you doing drugs. We made it clear to you” which makes me upset bc I couldn’t remember that.

He said “if you’re gonna do shit like this, don’t expect me to pick you up from the emergency department” which feels really hurtful, unnecessary and unkind. At the time he said “I’d be more than happy to come”. He was all like “you can always call me if you need support. Wouldn’t want you to feel alone.” 

And then chastised me so harshly for that snorting video, which makes me scared to talk openly with him in future. I’m not addicted to drugs but if it happens I’d feel too scared to tell him, given his reaction to this

Maybe my wellbeing makes him concerned about me beginning to use drugs but he could have expressed it in a more decent and kind manner instead of being so angry and chastising. It made me feel like shit.

TL;DR - Sent a video of me snorting a drug to my friend group. One got very angry and chastised me over text and I feel like it was overly harsh and insensitive",yta
"title: AITA for setting a glitter trap to catch my mother in law trying to snoop?
content: For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. 

However, she’s still always “forgetting” where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we’ve put locks on the rooms we don’t want her in, there isn’t really a problem anymore.  

Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn’t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  

I did this once before when husband didn’t believe me about the snooping to prove she’d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn’t say anything about it but then my husband couldn’t deny that she’d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. 

Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There’s a  baby gate so the kids can’t get upstairs either. 

Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I’m the asshole.  MIL also says I’m the asshole but SIL says I didn’t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it’s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA?

ETA: I can’t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple’s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.  

I will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.  

And if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)",nta
"title: AITA for setting boundaries?
content: I’m first generation, growing up my mom was the peace maker in her family. Everyone called her to vent, trauma dump and talk shit about the other person. She passed away 5 years ago this year. When she first passed away I would get calls from family, thinking “oh they’re checking in on us,” making sure we’re ok. The calls became weekly for over a year, all of my aunts on my moms side (my moms sister in laws) would call and vent, talk shit about about the other, tell me that they miss my mom. They’d call on Saturday nights when I’d be out with friends or on dates, as if I didn’t have a social life (i was 25 when my mom passed) 
So one day I stopped answering, my one aunt called 9 times in one week bc she thought something was wrong. (Not answering the phone was my only way I could think of to set this boundary) at the time I was going through my own things (I had my identity stolen and on top of that lost my job, the pandemic was starting to happen and I did not have the emotional capacity to be there for everyone else) I was having body numbing anxiety attacks and barley could get of bed. I clearly did not want to share this with my family bc they would just call one another and talk about it, I stayed to myself. Fast forward to now I’m in a better spot, have a great job. 

The calls have slowed down but now looking back how insensitive of them to dump all their negativity onto me when I was the one who lost my mom, but instead of me being the one everyone checked on it turned and I was checking on everyone. Thinking about it makes me sick and how much my mom took and how much an emotional toll it took on her and they passed that onto me. We are not as close anymore for many reasons. I will still call on holidays and bdays but I keep my distance for my peace. AITA for doing so? I’ve had my aunts say “since you don’t pick up the phone I don’t call that much” and make passive aggressive comments, I just ignore but the guilt does get to me from time to time. Does anyone else experience anything like this?",nta
"title: AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters?
content: I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.

A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). 

After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.

The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.

My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""

When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",nta
"title: AITA for shouting at my mom because she kept playing with her phone while driving?
content: I (20F) came home for the weekend to visit my mom (54F). She recently went through a tough divorce with my dad and shortly afterwards she started talking to an old friend in a romantic sense (who, in my opinion, is clearly taking advantage of her because she was in a vulnerable position).

That was about 5 months ago. So fast forward to today: we have a nice day, we get some food, take pics together, see my grandma (her mom), and the entire time wbile she was driving (even going 70mph on the highway), she kept pulling up pictures of her friend on her phone and shoving it in my face or putting it on the steering wheel to look at it while driving. I kind of shied away every time she did it and in the past I've asked her not to discuss too much abt him around me because she often starts saying very explicit and graphic things that a mother should not tell her daughter (I'll leave it at that, you do the math).

Finally, after dropping her phone and going down on the car floor to grab it (while driving!) I finally lost it and yelled at her to pick up her f**king phone and that I wasnt going to get into a car accident because she couldn't stop staring at a mediocre man. This understandably made her upset and we haven't talked since.

I definitely feel like an AH because I yelled at my mom, the woman who birthed me and has given me life and so many immeasurably incredible things, both this weekend alone and just throughout my 20 years of life. But at the same time I felt so fed up with this guy and how she was acting, and the tipping point was her doing all of this while driving. Not to mention I nearly got into a head on collision 2 days prior going the same speed because someone had been texting, swerved into my lane and nearly hit me.

"title: AITA for shouting at my mom that she’s B word?
content: I (17f) live with my mom (50F). Since I remember myself I’ve been under a lot of stress from my mom when it comes to school. My mom is constantly pressuring me to study non-stop by calling me names and telling me I’d end up in the streets. I don’t even have many friends due to that reason because I never have time for them. 

Today I went to a party with my friend group and during that party, my biology teacher sent a text to each student about an extra private lesson for Tommorow before an important exam. My phone was on silent so I had no idea until I turned my phone back on and saw the lesson had already been taken by another student. 

I came back home to see my mom sitting and waiting for me. She was convinced i read the message on time and asked me how am I going to wake up in time for my lesson.I told her I’m not going because another student already took the extra hour. She got furious and screamed at me that I’m an “Idiotic b” so I snapped back and shouted “you’re the one who’s a b” (ik it sounds ridiculous but in my language it’s a very harsh word). which made her go completely silent.

"title: AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?
content: Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.

Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.

We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'

He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.

We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'

I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.

He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??

He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.

I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.

I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. 

His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!",nta
"title: AITA for showing my husband the text his mom sent me and causing her to be disowned?
content: To start me and my mother in law have never gotten along. She hates my guts and can be oversensitive often times. I tried not to give her the wrong impression about me but we just don't like each other.

Sunday, I was feeling sick (I'm a new mom btw) and couldn't eat what she cooked for dinner and she seemeed to take it personal. She sent me a private message of what seemed to be her final straw with my behavior and it stated the following: copy/paste

""Oh yes I know and feel your passive aggressive vibe. You keep pretending to be sick so you won't have to eat what I cook? What? You think my cooking is disgusting? You think I'm unhigynec? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR? Apologies I forgot you're a new mom and can't be bothered to even get your hair brushed. You finally trapped our son and now want to use the baby as a pawn.I don’t like the fact you're my grandchild's mother. I don’t think I'll ever come to terms with it because you bore him. But I’ll pretend. Pretend I don’t know my son's been having chats with his ex every chance he gets. Be mean to his mommy. Me. And you’ll see how far that gets you. Oh and when I watch your shitbeast dog it stays chained to a garage day and night until a half hour before you arrive. It stinks up my house you know same with your hair and clothes"". My mind was blown and my gut reaction was to immediately go to my husband and show him what his mom sent and he didn't take it well. He tried calling her but she didn't respond. It was 11pm and he decided to drive to his parents house and pick a fight with her about the text. According to my sister in law #1 who witnessed it he yelled at his mother and berated her and caller her names then disowned her which shocked everyone in the house. My mother in law is diabetic she fainted on the spot and my husband didn't stop he just walked out of there while his family were yelling at him. I got several calls and texts from them claiming I just caused irreparable damage in my husband's relationship with his mother, jeopardized her health because she was taken to the hospital and worsthe of all making my husband disown her over what? A dinner that i could've gotten a few bites of? A simple misunderstanding? They accused me of causing this shitshow and turning my husband on his own mother and disowning her like that. Sister in law #3 berated me for sharing the text with my husband saying I should've confronted my mother in law alone instead of escalating the situation. She said I'm responsible for whatever happens next and have to fix the problem I created.

I feel awful overall and so guilty since she's at the hospital and the family are feeling tense. My husband is avoiding me.AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for shutting down talk about having kids with “purposely controversial statements?”
content:    
Our region has done well handling COVID, so my husband and I had a small group of family over for a backyard BBQ a month ago.

We’re the only ones in the family “left” who don’t have kids. We’re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds. Mind you, husband had the snip.

MIL jokingly mentioned that maybe with all the “alone time” we’d be giving the family a little bundle of joy. We shut the idea down with good humor. She kept pressing, and SIL chimed in with “Come on, this is the perfect time to get started!”

Husband: We’ve talked about this already. Let’s drop it.

MIL: Well, I don’t care. 

Husband: Again, drop it.

MIL: I hope it happens!

Husband: Thankfully we’re very careful.

MIL: Accidents happen. It isn’t always up to you.

Husband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?

We do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.

Until SIL says, “Vasectomies can fail, you know! It’s not a 100% thing.”

It gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.

MIL: So there’s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!

Husband & I lock eyes. Party’s over.

Me: That is exactly what abortions are for.

Cue screaming and yelling, I’m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.

Husband yells at them to GTFO, don’t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.

Husband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it’s what BOTH of us would want.

Party’s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL’s post tags us, says: “We were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.”

I do not feel like we’re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn’t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line.

"title: AITA for siding with my bf after he was ""racist"" to one of my friends?
content: Me (18F) and my bf (20M) have been together for three years. I'm part of a friend group since the beggining of High School, and we spend A LOT of time together. We're graduating soon and I really didn't wanna lose contact with them

I met my bf when I went to the US to practice English, he was on the same program. He is born and raised in Asia, and he still has a hard time comprehending our cultural differences

He recently came to visit me and spend a month in my country, and last friday we both went to a restaurant with my friends. One of them is mixed, her mother is white and her father is an African immigrant. She has small features, but a dark skin and long wavy black hair. Let's call her ""Jenna""

We all sat on the table and at some point we started to talk about how the usage of sunscreen is not common here like it is in East Asia, even tho we live in a hot country. I pointed out that we don't have the same beauty standards, and for us freckles and sunburns are cute. Jenna then said ""sun exposure can also make your skin tanned"" and my bf answered ""Yes, that's true. We have a lot of products that make your skin lighter tho, I can tell you what are the best ones if you want to try""

All of my friends stared at me, surprised and angry. Jenna simply stood up and left the restaurant, without paying her part of the bill. My bf seemed very confused and asked ""Is she OK?"". I told him we could talk about it later and I told my other friends we had to go home.

The car ride was very silent, my bf was driving and I was lost in my thoughts. When we arrived we sat on the sofa and I had a talk to him about colorism and how what he said was problematic. He understood and told me he didn't know it was bad and felt ashamed of what he did. We tried to call Jenna, but she didn't pick up. He left her a message through my phone saying he felt very sorry and wouldn't do that again

The message was marked as ""read"", but she didn't respond at all. This morning I went to school while my mother took my bf shopping. When I approached Jenna to say hi, she literally acted like I wasn't there. Than one of my other friends said that they wouldn't talk to someone that was dating a racist, and if I was still with him it's because I'm racist too. I told them that he had already understood his mistake and apologized. I also said that when ""Kelly"" made fun of my bf's accent they didn't say anything about racism, and that he's still trying to learn about our culture and diversity.

They said that being racist isn't something that can change in a weekend, and I'm disgusting for siding with him. ""Sarah"" then said that they would tell other people I'm racist. I was shocked at the immaturity, and told her if they spread those lies it would throw our friendship on the trash.

I just arrived home and am afraid my bf will feel guilty.
I still think they are overreacting and I won't end my relationship because of that. So, AITA?

Edit: Some ppl said I should've done something right away. We were in a crowded restaurant, and it would cause even more of a scene there. We went home right after Jenna left",yta
"title: AITA for siting with my boyfriend
content: I (F.17) have been together with my boyfriend (M.19) for 2 years and 2 months. We are in a long-distance relationship and I visit him about every other weekend, and sometimes he visits me too. However, when we had been together for about 9 months, there was a big fight between the two of them. I was at his place and was supposed to go back home that day, but my planned train was cancelled. I called my mom to let her know that I would be arriving an hour later than planned. She yelled at me very loudly, asking why I hadn't known about it earlier and why I was telling her only 1.30 houres before my original departure time, since she was already waiting for me. I started crying and after she hung up, I called my grandparents hoping they could help me. Unfortunately, my mom was with my grandparents and took the phone away from my grandma to continue yelling at me for seeking help. I cried even harder and my boyfriend took my phone away to explain the situation to my mom since I wasn't able to. Instead, she yelled at him to stay out of it. I can't say what the conversation was about because I left the room to calm down. I only heard yelling but didn't listen. And then... the drama began. I took the earliest train I could get and my boyfriend reassured me because I didn't want to go home. When I got home, my mom yelled at me that my boyfriend shouldn't talk to her like that and that I couldn't see him for the next 2 months. He's also not allowed to come to our home anymore, even to this day. Unfortunately, the two of them still haven't made up because they both think they're in the right, and it hurts me that they're estranged. I would like to have him over again. I'm on his side because I know he was only trying to protect me and he would have stayed calm and rational if my mom hadn't started yelling. The argument hasn't been resolved for over a year, and both are stubborn. My boyfriend feels guilty about everything that happened and is now even afraid of my mother. He's very sorry about everything and would like to clear things up, but he doesn't want to apologize to my mother unless she apologizes to him for yelling. And my mother thinks she's completely right and very resentful. She's a very controlling and opinionated person and doesn't see any faults. The rest of my family thinks it's wrong that I'm on my boyfriend's side because blood is thicker than water, but I'm on his side. The argument from back then still weighs on me sometimes, but fortunately not on our relationship. I'm moving out in 3-4 months, so the argument from back then won't matter anymore, but I need to clarify whether I'm in the wrong for siding with my boyfriend. PS: For a while, I wasn't even allowed to talk about my boyfriend because my mother had so much hate for him. She's calmed down now, but she still doesn't want to see him. She even wants to forbid me from inviting him to my birthday because she would have to see him. But I won't let her ruin my 18th birthday.",yta
"title: AITA for snapping at my boyfriend when he repeatedly disturbed me?
content: This happened on Sunday. Bf loves football and had gone into town to watch his team play. My sport is F1 and that was on later in the night (UK time). The plan was that bf was going into town around lunch time, spending a few hours at the pub with his friends before going to the match, and then going back to the pub for an hour afterwards to give the trains a chance to be less busy for his journey back to mine. He said he'd be back for around 7:30pm, which would give us a chance to have dinner (a takeaway) before the race started at 8:30.

So he goes into town, does all his stuff, all good. But he didn't leave until almost 8 and the journey back is half an hour so I start getting stressed that I won't be able to settle for the race and think about suggesting we get food afterwards instead. 6 mins before the race is due to start he messages me saying the place he wants to order from closes at 9 so could I order it now and he'll collect it once he gets back. So I'm hurrying trying to order fast so I don't miss the start of the race. I get settled just in time for the start and text him that I'll be watching from now so please dont disturb. I'm watching on his iPad because it's the only device in the house that has sky.

He gets in, quietly greets me and then goes out to pick up the food. Comes back, puts it in the kitchen and shouts for me to come eat, I say I'll have it later because I wanna concentrate on the race, he keeps bugging me about it getting cold but I say it's fine.

After his food he comes and sits right next to the screen and is just scrolling on his phone but he starts singing/chanting and making silly noises. I ask him to stop bc I'm trying to watch. He stops for a bit, leaves the room, comes back, starts doing it again. I know he's had a few drinks and he's in that mood bc of his day but it's annoying me as he got to watch his sport and now he wont let me watch mine. I asked him to stop again, he went away again and came back 10 mins later asking me to do something else. It was almost the end of the race now and I was done, felt like I'd barely had the chance to actually settle and enjoy it so I snapped. Told him to leave me alone because I've been interrupted 4 times now and I just want to enjoy the one sport that I watch. In response he gets annoyed and starts threatening to take the iPad away so I can't watch it (he knew I'd be watching on the iPad, it wasn't like he came home and I'd just commandeered his iPad, the plan was he was gonna watch it with me when he got home but for some reason he started doing the things I described instead, normally he does watch it with me). I pointed out that he'd been able to watch his sport today so why shouldn't I be allowed to watch mine in peace. He started protesting that it wasn't his fault even though it was so I just ignored him and tried to focus on the end of the race and the interviews.

We didn't really talk for the rest of the night. We're okay now but just wondering AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for snapping at my sister
content: My (28f) little sister ""M"" (26f) and I have never been super close due too growing up in a abusive household and she making me her punching bag for everything. When she gets angry she says that I'm a bad mother and a worse human being and even though it really hurts when she says those things I don't let it show to her when she acts out on me.Today M called me to complain about a friend she met a couple of months ago. He had been at her house for a party this weekend and M had asked him harmless questions, but then he just stood up and left and texted M that he couldn't handle the questions and that he felt like she interrogated him and that she made him have a panic attack. M tells me that she think he was acting immature and told him that he was acting like a child and that she didn't want him to be a part off her life anymore.
I told my sister that it's okay I'd she doesn't want him in her life anymore she decides that, but she shouldn't have been so mean to him because she doesn't know if he might be struggling with some sort of anxiety. She said no he isn't, she has known him for 2 months and he does not have anxiety. I then told her that she can't know that, he can hide it from everyone and besides 2 months is not enough time to really know another. She disagreed and I just didn't want to have that discussion. But then she continues telling me that he is childish because he is diagnosed with ADHD and that he can't help being childish. I told her she can't blame it on ADHD and that she can't just call him childish just because he couldn't handle she questioning him. She got angry and started to say that I think I know everything and that it was exhausting for her to hear me say to her all the time that she was wrong, I tried to tell her that I know that I don't know everything. She then said that I don't know that I don't know everything. I knew then that she was trying to get a reaction out of me and told her that if she is done I'm going to hang up. She wasn't done, she kept saying that I was cruel and vicious and that I lied all the time and that she felt sorry for my husband and daughter for having to put up with a know-it-all like me. I snapped. Usually I don't give her a reaction, but today I just snapped. I said that enough is enough, that I'm tired of being her punching bag and she needed to grow up and take responsibility for her own words and actions, and that she is the one acting like a child and that I have had enough of her bs and that she can call me when she decides to be an adult. The thing is, that I feel bad for snapping at her. I'm usually calm towards her when she acts out like that. Our parents haven't really been there for us and the responsibility of a parent fell on me from an early age. I am no contact with my mother and the rest of the family, I just have my father and sister left and I kinda feel like I'm the one being at fault here.

So, AITA??",nta
"title: AITA for speaking up about my brothers girlfriends dog??
content:  

I (17) live with both my parents and my brother. my brothers and his girlfriend have been dating for six years now. Every few weeks she comes and stays with us for a several days. And she has a little dog that she brings with her. This girl is really sweet and respectful to us and our home, however her dog is not. 

This dog behaves terribly when he’s over. He pees everywhere, poops everywhere, eats my cats food, terrorizes my cats, and barks/screams all day long. He has been doing this for almost a year and a half. 

When my brother and his girlfriend go out on dates or for whatever reason, they leave my me and my parents alone with the dog. And while they’re gone, the dog is even more unbearable than he is when they are both home.

So today my brother and his girlfriend went to the movies and left the dog with us, he of course wouldn’t stop barking. So I texted my brother and said “ Hey, the dog is misbehaving like always, I’m not trying to be an asshole, but you need to do something about this because it’s getting out of hand” and he was like “do you want me to come home early and get him?” And I said “no no don’t worry about it. It’s fine, just enjoy your movie”….. but they decided to come home early anyway to deal with the dog. and now, in the eyes of my parents, I’m an absolute asshole because I ruined their outing. 

Even though this dog bothers everyone in the house, my parents refuse to say it to his or her face. Instead, they said “no, we never said anything this dog doesn’t bother us at all. This dog is great!” And it’s like…. You clearly don’t think that, you’re just too polite to ever set any boundaries or rules at all IN YOUR OWN HOME. 

My brother’s girlfriend was crying and left because she felt bad, which made me feel like a total dick for causing this intervention. But at the end of the day, this is our home, and that is not our dog. I decided to speak up about this dogs constant misbehavior in my home and I’m being attacked for it.

My parents went to comfort her saying how they love this dog so much and they’ve never cared that he does all these things. And the truth is that they do care, they’re just too shy to say anything. My brother tries to justify and mention all the misbehavior of our own family dogs. However, the difference is that those are OUR dogs. so their actions are OUR responsibility. But her dog, is not OUR dog. So everything that he’s been doing in our home is not for us to deal with. And I’m Not saying that she can’t come over or anything like that, I’m just saying that we need to set boundaries.",yta
"title: AITA for standing up for myself???
content: Throwaway so my family doesn't see and attack me.

I was at a celebration party with me and my family (cousins, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, the like.) There were 3 cousins of mine, lets name them Lee(F21), Elizabeth(F24), and Mary(F23). The exchange is very long so I will summarize it.

Elizabeth: The furry community is absolutely disgusting. I cant believe people actually spend thousands of dollars on fursuits and make animal noises.

Mary: I agree wholeheartedly.

Me: Um, actually, I support the furry community and don't think the entire community is all that bad. Sure, the community definitely has a huge amount of people that are really concerning, but--

Elizabeth: Are you a furry?

Me: No? I do support them though.

I then pulled out my phone and showed them a picture of me cosplaying Alastor from Hazbin Hotel.

Me: See, this is me cosplaying a furry. But I don't make animal noises.

Mary: Throw that away right now. Throw all of that away. I can't believe I'm in the same room with a furry!

Lee: You're disgusting. (Insert a bunch of racial slurs against blacks.)

Lee then repeatedly started to insult me, referring to me as a ""thing"" and then they started to use it/its pronouns. (My pronouns are she/her.) When I went quiet because I didn't want to burst out in anger in front of my nephews. When I went quiet, they started talking about how I probably had rabies and that they were going to ""put me on a leash."" I left the party and now my entire family is blowing up my phone, saying I overreacted and that I shouldn't have left. I feel so confused.

TL;DR: My cousins were being disrespectful against the furry community so I stood up against the community and got called a bunch of racial slurs and downgraded in a negative way.

Edits: I'd like to clarify me and my cousins were in the kitchen, preparing food. The family did not hear this exchange between us and if I yelled at them for downgrading me and being disrespectful to multiple communities, my nephews would hear and one of them is very sensitive to loud noises.

My dad died unexpectedly last week and my sister Jess and I lost our mom last year to a mix of cancer and the virus. 
From how our family acted in the past over scavenging over dead people’s things both Jess and I decided to send out a family memo on no one is to enter or take anything from our parents house until we get there. Both Jess and I work on the west coast so it takes some time to get there with all of our kids and family. 

I saw several notifications from my parents Ring Doorbell and I’m a lawyer. I reminded my family we will prosecute. Jess and I are on the same page. 
Jess gets to my parents house first and notices stuff is missing and my parents had security cameras and an Alexa show. It shown my cousin taking stuff from the house. So Jess did what we agreed on and called the police and two of our cousins was arrested. Because it was over a thousand dollars both are looking at felonies. My cousin said my dad promised him this stuff and I have my dad’s will making me executor of the estate. I told him he should have waited to file a claim with estate and everyone was warned about what would happen. 
Jess and I don’t have the best relationship with our extended family and We are not dropping charges. Because of this drama dad was quietly cremated with no service and we plan to hold one when scattered our parents ashes at Jess’s house in a tree planted for them.

"title: AITA for still going to my dental appointment after my husband tried to get me to reschedule?
content: 

So I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.

My husband's (m37) best friend ""Terry"" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically ""tell on me"" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.

Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.

He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.

Instead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.

content: I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.

My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it.

"title: AITA for suggesting a chore chart?
content: 
I am going to start this with no I am not getting a divorce you ppl on Reddit love to suggest that.

my husband is a soldier, I am pregnant and I stay at home taking care of the house. I do all the house work except for dishes, litter and trash. I have back problems that the pregnancy is making worse, so I can’t stand for long and my feet also get super red and puffy and numb if I stand in one spot for more than 15 minutes. I can’t clean the litter box (my OB directly told my husband to start doing it) and we usually take turns taking out the trash but on deep clean days it’s a lot and heavy so he does it. 

My husband likes to put off his chores until the last minute. He gets home, sometimes he eats the food I make with me sometimes he takes it to our room and eats while playing video games often than not it’s video games. I ask him to wash the dishes he says he will later. They sit there for days me asking for it to be done. I eventually have to wash them so I can cook, which takes all day because I can’t stand for long. I point this out to him he says he does them Saturday. But that’s disgusting bc most of the time he just puts his dish in the sink with food on it still. 

The litter box is awful. My poor cat shouldn’t have to deal with stepping in their own shut to go potty. I tell him he needs to clean out the litter box, same fucking thing. I don’t know how often he actually does it but if it’s only when I ask him to it’s once every 2-3 weeks and at that time it’s a mountain.

He also leaves food on his side of them room and all kinds of trash. It’s disgusting. His side of the room I don’t touch because then he can never find anything. But then it gets so messy in his side it goes to mine. 

He plays videogames until 12-3 in the morning. All his friends are single men that are unemployed so he stays in with them all night. I wake him up in the morning because I drive him. I have to yell at him to wake up and sometimes have to throw a pillow at him.

My suggestion ti him after I gave up on having to beg was to get him a chore chart and stickers. Put his chores and brushing teeth and shower on it and he has to put a sticker when he completes them and then he can play. He said I was treating him like a child. He is acting like a child. Besides this he is a good husband. I’m just so tired. And his friends yell loud enough Everytime I ask him something I can hear them say “women belong in the kitchen” and all other shit. 

When he does his chores and spend time with me he is wonderful. But he plays videogames constantly and it is taking over our life. We had sex maybe once in the last month bc of this. I don’t know what else to do. But I don’t want him ti feel bad and feel like I am mothering him. I am his wife, but he is the money maker so maybe I should just give up and do it all.

The $400 we get used to last the 5 of us almost 3 weeks, AND we were buying baby formula at the time. We need to figure this out because we can't afford this.

Then I get a bunch of messages from friends about 3 months later telling me to go to their channel. I'm pretty much done with them but I do and I realise they made a video about me where they claim I was emotionally abusive.

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.

"title: AITA for suing my friend / ex in Small Claims Court?
content: Throwaway account.

My ex Bernadette (35F) and I (Franky, 42M, names changed for anonymity) broke up about two and a half years ago after dating for a year, and remained friends after the breakup. 

About six months after we broke up she asked to borrow money. At the time she was working full time for a political campaign but wasn't allowed to be paid (election laws). The moment it was legal for the campaign to do so she would be paid a $15k lump sum plus an ongoing salary. She borrowed over $1200 for expenses including a hefty phone bill because it was going to get cut off the next day, and if that happened she would be unable to work or obtain that payment (and had difficulty in continuing her career path in that field). She said she would pay the loan back as soon as her payment went through in a couple weeks, and I thought it would help her personally and professionally a lot more than I'd need that cash over the next two weeks.

She borrowed the money, paid off her phone, got her lump sum payment of $15k (plus salary going forward), and essentially ghosted. She's paid back some of it, but got very angry when I asked about a repayment timeline a couple months later and asked me to ""leave it with her.""

Fast forward over a year. I've moved to a new city, and I'm in way more debt than I've ever been in before. We still have mutual friends and I am aware that she's gone on two different vacations out of the country, one of which involved flights to several different cities.

We don't talk. I messaged her and said this is dragging on, I need some sort of timetable of when she expects to be able to repay me, small installments over six months or more is fine. I support her taking time to recharge, but need to know she at least plans to repay this. No response.

A month after that I threatened to sue in small claims court to collect the debt if she was unable or unwilling to communicate an acknowledgment or basic timeline for repayment. No response.

My previous career involved me drafting claims regularly. I'm very familiar with the process. Our conversations and agreements are well documented. It wouldn't be that hard to pursue or collect. I just feel like an asshole because, well, suing friends is trash, and I know this is going to add WAY more costs onto the debt (likely at least triple, more it if she does not agree to pay, court fees are ridiculous here), but my alternative is eat it and I really don't see why I should do that either. I've got no good options. I've made her aware of the fees and still no response.

"title: AITA for supporting my wife after my daughter publicly exposed her diary which had ""cruel"" comments?
content: I have been remarried for a year now to my wife. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.

My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.

And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.

A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.

My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.

My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.

She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.

And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.

I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.

But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.

My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.

My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.

I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.

I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.

My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.

My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.

I have taken my wife's side in all this. Am I the asshole? My entire family has been blown up.",nta

Xander and Lia hate Sarah. (I wasn't there when this happened this is just what I heard)It started when Sarah told Lia that her clothes are inappropriate. They got into an arguement and Xander joined to defend Lia and tell Sarah it's none of her business.

Lia and Xander have started to refer to Sarah as ""the bitch"" when they are talking about her, especially when Sarah is around and they don't want her to find out they are talking about her. They have her name saved as the bitch in their phones

The problem started when Lia lost her phone. In an attempt to help her, Sarah called her and found the phone and found out she is ""the bitch"" that they talk about.

"title: AITA for taking neighbors cat to the shelter?
content: Apologies for my English, as it's rather wanky and not my first language. *also bad formatting (phone), sorry
Our neighbor Adam (not a real name) has a outdoor kitty, Viky. She usually walks with us when we take the dog out. We also leave cat food leftovers  and some kibbles outside and she likes to come and eat them.
Onto the situation.
Four days ago she came up to us with a terrible injury on her left eye. I won't go into the details as it was awful, but someone most likely shot her (we have some crazy person shooting dogs/cats here, not the first occurance). Only her left eye was affected but it was BAD. 
We immediately contacted Adam insisting he takes her to the vet as soon as possible. He assured us he's going to do something.
4 days later we haven't seen her outside so we assumed she's getting the care she needs.
Well, later that evening she once again came up to us whilst we were out with the dog and guess what- her eye is even worse than before and very much untreated. This time we took her inside (bathroom, as we have cats of our own) and once again texted Adam. This time he responded that he'd rather wait and not "" put her under some veterinary experiments"" (???). We insisted she's doing very badly- now she moves in slow motion, can hardly walk, doesn't eat nor drink, the eye is constantly bleeding and has a fever. 
ONCE AGAIN we texted him that it's very urgent and she needs help ASAP, but he didn't respond (he had around 12 hours to do so).
We don't have the money nor a car to even get her to the vet, but we do have an acquaintance in a shelter (in my country they're all no kill) who agreed to take her in. We didn't contact Adam to tell him this, as it was very urgent. At that point she couldn't even lift her head.
Now that she's out of our hands I'm wondering though- AITA? Maybe there was a more diplomatic way of dealing with this. I do feel like a bit of an a-hole. btw- we might follow up with animal abuse claim against them. *MINI UPDATE- yeap, she's been shot. the shelter contacted us. she's going to lose her left eye but thankfully won't lose her life..",nta

My brother and I (both early 20s, students) try to go somewhere for a few days with our dad once/yr and J comes with. Last vacation as a surprise she bought tickets to a show for everyone which was really nice of her. I did not know at the time but they were quite expensive $100-150 each. My brother and I talked about it and we covered the meal/drinks and an activity beforehand (over $300 for everyone). After the show we thanked her. 

Recently she made a comment about how she’ll never do that again and how my brother and I are ungrateful. For context, she and my brother don’t have the best relationship and she did not particularly care for the activity, but was initially wanting to go. Also on these trips, my dad pays everything for her. Airbnb got split 3 ways and meals get split 1/2 to Dad, 1/4 each to me and brother. This sounds relatively fair except usually my brother or I sleep on a couch and J drinks very expensive scotch and tequila.

"title: AITA for taking time off of work for myself instead of my girlfriend
content: I (25m) and my girlfriend (25f) were invited to a wedding a couple weeks ago by one of her college friends I haven't met. I had just landed a new job and didn't want to request half a week off straight after getting hired. The wedding was also being hosted about 7 hours away as well, and if I didn't take off work I'd have to buy a $500 roundtrip flight to make it in time. Overall, I thought the timing, location, and my relationship to the couple was enough to justify me not going but my girlfriend was pissed.

Anyways, last week I put in a notice for a day off to celebrate Mothers Day and my Dads birthday. I didn't think anything of it until I mentioned it to my girlfriend today, and now she's not talking to me. I had completely forgot about the wedding which, to my dismay, is being hosted the same week. Now I'm the bad guy who wouldn't take off for my girlfriend but will for myself.

"title: AITA for talking with too much emotion?
content: I'm very expressive and it's hurting my relationships.

I have a habit of using my hands when I speak. Usually when I talk I'm very quiet but when I'm having a full conversation or explaining something my voice is louder and some say I sound like I'm trying to start an argument. I don't know what to do. This morning my boyfriend walked out without saying goodbye because we were having a talk that 2as kind of one sided in my opinion, I was telling him something I learned on here and he was being quite rude so I asked him what was wrong and he said that I was being rude myself. He then said he's gonna have a bad day (presumably because of me) and blamed it on his sleep but I got less than him staying up all night with the baby.

I'm tired of him treating me this way and I'm honestly just talking. It really hurts my feelings and everyone wants me to talk quieter or more gentle but why should I have to do that this is just the way I talk? Just not to offend you?? 

He saw my face and saw that I really wasn't mad. And he still looked at me with that blank expression and I had to watch him storm out to the car and drive off ten minutes early just so he could get away from me without even a goodbye.  Life is so fucking lonely sometimes.

"title: AITA for telling a ""friend"" that I don't give a shit about her daughters birthday?
content: I realize it may have been harsh. Backstory: I was best friends with ""Nicole"" for 6 years and lived with her for a year. After I met my husband 5 years ago, she became offended that he was ""stealing away her best friend"", expressed her hate for him without meeting him and started growing distant very quickly. Bailing on our plans last minute and then complaining we never saw eachother, etc. I haven't seen her in 2 years. She only reaches out to me if she wants to talk about herself and it's been one sided so contact has been fairly limited. 

My family (husband, kids, pets) recently hit hard times. Lost our house, extreme loss of income (husband was in a really bad accident) and having to re-home pets due to lack of resources during this time (all in very loving homes and we are able to see them still). We are currently staying with my mother in one bedroom with 3 kids and have hardly any money to our name. I admittedly do not care about anything other than picking ourselves back up. 

My ""friend"" reached out via group chat yesterday with her daughters birthday wish list. I didn't respond to it. She later texts me saying ""Can you believe my beauty will be 14 in 2 days? She can't wait to see you! What will you be bringing so I know not to get it?"" I didn't even know there was a party, for starters. So I said ""I'm not going. I have too much going on."" (She knows what's going on right now). She responded with ""What? It's literally her birthday and you're not coming? She expects to see you."" So I said ""I literally just said I'm not going because of all the shit I have going on. I don't give a  damn about other kids birthdays. I care about providing for my kids and getting my husband's health up."" She said I'm a selfish AH for not being there for her daughter and for not caring about her kids birthday.",nta
"title: AITA for telling a Kid to not enter the chicken coop without his parents
content: So I help out at a local Chicken Coop in fact I actually run it. We own 8 hens all rescued. I like to let the hens out to explore outside their coop. Right outside is a fenced in area with a pond. Unfortunately the hens can go under the fence onto the main garden but it’s pretty easy for me to catch them. 

Last Sunday was the first time I let the hens explore the pond area. During that time was also a church service going on. My aunt and uncle are in charge of the church so they allow me to let the hens out. Last Sunday was hell for me. I had about 10 kids in the pond area splashing the water and being loud. I’m not good at telling kids off I hate it.  So this Sunday I talked to both my aunt and the man who is supposed to run this project and they agree with it. The plan was to only allow kids in if their parents and/or guardians are with them. My aunt was supposed to announce this but she forget about parental supervision. A young boy came up to the pond area and I told him he can’t come in unless he is with his parents. He runs off back to his mum. I thought great now she can come supervision or tell her son to wait till service is over to come see the hens. Nope she came over and told me off. I was soo thankful that a woman who helps run the garden was with me and she spoke up for me. I am terrible at confrontation of any kind. I did tell her that it was supposed to be announced but didn’t. She then had the audacity to say that we as adults (I’m 22f) could let 6 kids in at a time and we can handle it. I just stood there dumbfounded and hurt as i tried last week and couldn’t handle it. I’m not there for the kids I’m there for the hens. 

Later on I get a message from the hens group chat and she wrote a rant about how embarrassed her kid was to be sent back. She then suggested to wait till service is over to let the hens out. I was sooo pissed. I didn’t mean to embarrass the kid but I get overwhelmed very easily yes he want there last week but other kids were and from that experience I learnt to let the parents handle their kids. I told my aunt to deal with her and now we going to have a church meeting about it next Sunday which she won’t even be there for. 

AITA for trying saying no to this kid and to go get his parents to be allowed in.

Small Update: Today I got a message from the mother privately saying she’s sorry that the text she sent upset me. I don’t know if she figured that herself or if my aunt told her. My aunt is very protective of me and I did tell her to deal with the mother as I was really annoyed and would probably have gone off one her. I apologised to the mother as well for upsetting her child and explained what happens and why I sent him back. I promised on Sunday I would try and find an outcome that everyone is happy about. I shall update this after the meeting on Sunday is done.",info

content: Hey!

I'm (28f) quite a homebody, and I really value the stability and cleanliness of my home. Because of this, I don't often make my home available for guests as I find they make me anxious, leave a mess, and disrupt my routine. 

My friend (32f) reached out to me a month ago saying she was taking a break from her relationship and needed somewhere to stay while she thought about continuing the relationship. Apparently she had gotten in a big fight with her partner,  and wanted a week to think things over with distance. Because this seemed serious I offered my space, even though I was going to be out of town at the time she requested. 

I cleaned my space, washed all the linens, got snacks and things to be a good host, rushed to get a spare set of keys so she could use them, made time in my schedule to drop them off to her, etc. 

I then left on my trip. I came back 5 days later to my house just as I left it. She ended up deciding to stay at someone else's place. 

She then had another argument with her boyfriend and asked me again if she could stay at my place. I said no, as I've already essentially hosted her. She said ""no you didn't, I didn't even go over to your place."" 

I said ""just because you decided not to come doesn't mean I didn't make my house hosting ready, and put in the time and work to be a host. I only do this every so often and I honestly don't want to do it again."" 

She said I was being ridiculous and that it's not like I had to do a lot. Still, it throws off my routine and my peace of mind in my own home. I spent my whole trip thinking about all the cleaning I'd have to do when I'd get home because she's kind of a messy person. I was relieved that she didn't actually use the place, but it didn't mean the mental weight wasnt there. 

So, am I the asshole for saying no?",nta

Landlord had one meeting and I had a separate meeting(landlord wanted my input). I have some key things that I wanted to know because of previous bad roommate situations. One of these things is smoking. I have bad asthma and have a prescribed inhaler. I asked them if they smoke anything, they both said no. The rest of the meeting went well, so I agreed with my landlord that it would be a good match. First week of them living here, I immediately smell pot coming from their room. I give it a couple of days, smell did not let up. I called for a house meeting and reiterated, among many other things,  to not smoke in the house. If you smoke, do it outside or in your car. The woman stated she can't smoke due to drug testing at work, and the man denied smoking. Later the male roommate asked me if it was okay to smoke blunts on the patio.... I told him that if it doesn't come into the house it is fine, but if I start getting sick, there's no way. I asked him why he didn't say that he smoked when I first met him, he shrugged and said he forgot.

"title: AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?
content: So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.

I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.

Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.

Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""

I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.

My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.

So AITA here?

Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.

Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200B;

This summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200B;

I didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200B;

I'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.

That killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.""

A couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.",info
"title: AITA for telling my ILs I will not be changing the name of my bakery just because they work there?
content: The bakery was originally my parents bakery, my mom's more specifically. Dad worked there but mom ran the whole thing and she was the driving force behind it. The bakery was named something with Sun in it. When my parents had me four years later they named me Sunny. My mom had a very complicated pregnancy and delivery and I was going to be their only child. So they named me after the bakery. I always loved the connection and it was especially meaningful because my mom died when I was 7. Dad kept it running with help, so I could take it over one day if I wanted to, so mom's legacy never died. He got sick when I was 16. It was tough. He fought as long as he could but he died when I was 18 and I took over the bakery. I baked from a really young age and dreamed of running it one day. So I took over as the head baker and have kept it open myself for a decade now. In that time I met and married my wife Lila, she started working there and her mom and sister also joined the small team we have. It was going well until a few months ago. We were at Lila's parents house, her whole family was there, and they brought up how the name for the bakery feels wrong when the family has changed so much. Lila told them the bakery is still mine and given the history and who named it, they shouldn't think they would get a say in any of it. It was dropped for a while. Then they brought it up again. Lila again reminded them that it was none of their business.

Lila is expecting our first child now and she hasn't been working as much, or at all these last couple of months, and I have noticed some comments here and there from MIL especially about ""darling bakery names"" or how nice businesses names are when they tell you it's a family run thing. I would internally roll my eyes but smile and say those were great names for those people's businesses. Clearly she got annoyed because then her and my SIL cornered me recently and told me that they felt like they had such a big part in it, which they don't, that the name should reflect the family and not just me or what my mom had wanted to call it. I told them I will not be changing the name just because they work there and if that is a problem there is no reason for them to force themselves to stay if they don't want to. Both told me they do want to work there and told me I was twisting what they said, that they just want to feel more included and like this is their family business too. MIL told me that unless we plan on naming our child some sun related name, it's just going to be a random name in the future. I pointed out many businesses are that. But they told me I was being deliberately obtuse.

"title: AITA for telling my Inlaws exactly where my husband was when I was in labor?
content: I gave birth to my son 10 weeks ago. I went through exhausting period while I was nearing my due date. I was experiencing discomfort and wanted my husband by my side when I go into labor but he'd go out every night to hang out at his friend's place and watch football games. I suggested that he play/watch games at home just in case but he was having none of it and said he had to attend game night at his brother& friend's place along with his buddies. He said they had certain... How can i describe it? ""rituals?"" when watching a game and he can't enjoy doing it at home or anywhere else.

The night of our son's birth my water broke while my husband was at his buddies place watching a game. I called him and told him to get home and take me to the hospital he said he was coming but he didn't. I ended up calling my sister (she lives nearby) and she took me to the hospital. My husband showed up 2hrs later after he kept calling asking if I was still in labor and that he was almost done watching the game.

He was able to make it on time for our son's birth but I was furious with him, mad and disappointed. He apologized profoundly and has been working on regaining my trust and respect for him after what he's done. He's otherwise very supportive and involved in our son's care.

Last night I was at my in-laws house for dinner and we were talking about my son's birth date. My husband suddenly started ""recalling"" what happened that night and basically started lying about driving me to the hospital, waiting and feeling stressed out and standing on his feet for so long without food or even water. I was confused I said no! none of this was true, none of this happened in fact, he was watching a game when I went into labor and I wanted him to drive me to the hospital but didn't show up til 2 hours later. My mother in law who takes no shit from anybody and whom everyone *fears* lost it on him yelling asking him if that was true and he kept quiet. she started berating him left and right telling him to sit down and shut up when he stood up to argue then told him to stand up when he was sitting arguing. Everyone was laughing at how she basically treated him as if he was a boy in trouble. She kept saying ""Shame shame shame! on you, this is not how I raised my children to treat their wives, Jordan you are a disgrace and I'm disappointed because of what I heard about you"". He literally swallowed every bit of his mother's berating and didn't say anything til we got home where he went nuts saying I made him look neglectful, a bad husband and father by telling the family about where he was and said I shouldn't have said anything but I argued it wasn't okay for him to lie and play hero in front of his parents. He said I just caused a rift between him and family and asked if I was happy now.

aita? Should I have not said anything?

EDIT to say that he's done similar things in the past since he's a major enthusiast of football and hockey but I didn't expect it to get to that. Also this is not our first baby together, we have a 4 year old son.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my S/O to not use my car because it’s more expensive
content: So me and my S/O have been together for a few years. We both have our own cars, I have a newer car (2020 Rav4) that I paid off completely within 6 months of purchasing it completely by myself which after taxes and everything ended up being $50,000. I’m really proud of that especially at 29 years old. It was a lot of hard work. He is into older modified cars, I believe he purchased his around $7000. 

Anyways, so we mostly take my car when we go out and about together just because mine  is more of a smoother ride, better gas mileage and what not. Today he was going to go pick something up at his sisters house and he went to reach for my keys and I asked him to take his car just because if I’m not in the car I feel uncomfortable. If I end up getting into an accident or crash it, fine my fault. But if someone is else were to take my car and crash it, all my hard work would be down the drain due to someone else negligence. I could tell my S/O was offended when I asked him to take his car but come on.

Now he does help with maintenance, like we just bought tires for it. The total came out to $400 which he did help pitch in $100 and I paid the rest just due to it being my car. He does change the oil.

Idk, am I the stingy A-hole for asking him to use his car and stop trying to take mine everywhere as if it’s his car?

Edit because this question has come up a couple times, yes I would and have let him use my car if his were to break down no problem. But he just seems to always reach for my keys when his car is perfectly fine. He just doesn’t want to get it out of the garage.

Yes I help him with his car, for instance this past weekend I gave him $300 for new rims on his car and I don’t expect to drive his. His car is lowered and I know i would probably scrap the shit out of it if I tried lol",info

Backstory my cousin (33f) who I’ll call mary lost her husband (32m) and two of her three children (3f) and (9months male) in a car accident last week. Her and her daughter (5) are as you would expect it’s just heartbreaking 


Well today was the funeral my brother’s wife (26) announced her pregnancy the second the arrived at our house this morning we were like “ok congratulations but please keep it on the down low for today”

Well when we arrived at the church she kept making gagging sounds and robbing her stomach saying “I as a mom can’t imagine what she is going through” they have no kids so people would look at her and she’d tell them she was pregnant 


Afterwards at my aunts house my sil kept making everything about her like someone’s in the bathroom sil would loudly say “pregnant lady needs to pee” 
She literally told my cousins sister give her, her seat so “the lady with a baby could rest her feet”

I ignored her till she came to Mary stuck out her flat belly and said “me and Issac just found out I was pregnant and honestly we are beside ourselves it could happen to us” Mary broke down 

I snapped like who says that to a woman who just literally lost two babies?? I said loudly to my sil “no gives a fuck you’re pregnant look around it’s not just one but two babies  funerals not to mention the love of Mary’s life like I knew you were an attention seeker but for fuck sake you took the test four days ago just leave” 

she left did in tears and my bother called me a fat bitter bitch 

I’ve gotten phone calls form my bother and sil family calling me the world of name because I made a pregnant woman cry 

If I’m being honest even tho Mary and my aunt thanked me because it was all making her upset I feel worse about making a scene 

Please put me in my place if I’m wrong


So little update I found out this morning brother and sil harassed my cousin with phone calls for her to talk to me about yesterday. My aunt gave both of them an ear full than made my cousin turned off her phone my brother and sil were at my parents house trying to get their side in (parents are on my side) when I arrived . They both came at me screaming and yelling about sil feelings and she could miscarry from the stress I  caused her again i told them a  Funeral especially one for two children isn’t the time to announce a pregnancy and get the fuck out of my face . Sil said if I didn’t lose my attitude and apologise I’d never be in their child’s Life. i told her I didn’t care and if she was gonna use the kid as weapon i didn’t want to be in it’s life things got heated and my father ended up kicking out my brother and sil so yeah all this drama at a time we should be there for one another 

And to the people asking in the comments and dms you can use this story I want my bother to find it and read the comments",nta
"title: AITA for telling my SIL that I don't care that her baby died and to leave me alone?
content: Me and SIL, Daisy, have been friends since High School (15 years ago). I started dating her brother, Dan, when we were all in college. Daisy married Matt sometime after I married Dan 10 years ago. 

Matt and Daisy wanted a baby and starting trying right after marriage but they were having a lot of trouble. I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. 

I have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. 

3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. 

2 weeks before I was supposed to give birth, Dan passed away in an accident. I don't have any family except for Dan and Daisy. Daisy refused to attend the funeral because she will have to see me. The day before the funeral and I called her and begged her to come. I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. 

Soon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. 

2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said ""Ok"". She then asked ""Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?""

I pretty much said, ""I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. I don't care about Matt. I don't care that your baby died. Just leave me and my daughter alone."" and then hung up. 

Since then she has been sending me multiple emails and vm's stating how awful I am and how heartless and how much Dan would be disappointed. I continued to just ignore everything. 

So, AITA?. 

Edit: Please don't DM me about leaving a person homeless during pandemic. I am already aware of the fact. I don't care. No matter what anyone says I am not going to have any sympathy or help her in any way. I am only asking for a judgement on what I said and how I said it.

Edit 2: I am getting a lot of annoying DM's because someone cross posted this somewhere else. Please stop. 

Edit 3: Please stop giving me unsolicited advise regarding changing my mind about helping her. That's not going to happen. If I wanted advice, I would have posted it in relationship_advice, not here. I only asked you to judge what I said to her and how I said it. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE. So, please stop.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my aunt not to serve dinner with lunch?
content: My aunt, uncle and cousins are all visiting. On Sunday I said I would make lunch for everyone. My aunt has cooked several meals since the visit began, and we have gone out to eat many times. While I was cooking my aunt came in and said she needed to do prep on something she was going to make for dinner. I was annoyed, but the kitchen is big enough for two people, and there are a lot of people, so I understood needing to start early.

She made dumplings while I was making lunch. When the dish I made was done I started to make the plates. She tried to put two dumplings on each plate. I told her not to do that because they were for dinner. She said it was okay and she would make more. I said I made enough food for lunch, and there was no need for dumplings. She said she wanted everyone to try them to see if they liked them.

Everyone ate the food and said it was good and my aunt was very pleased, but I didn't say anything. My mom asked if I liked the dumplings, and I said they didn't go with the dish I made. My uncle said they did, that they complimented each other perfectly. I didn't respond. My aunt asked me why I was ""being like this"" and I said I just wanted to make one meal for the family, and I didn't try to interfere with her meals, so I didn't understand why she did mine.

My mom said I was being ridiculous, so I didn't say anything else about it. This morning my aunt made breakfast and asked me to help, but I said no, that I was busy. She asked if I was still upset about the dumplings, and I said no that I was just busy. She said I was acting like a child. I said I was busy, and if she wanted a break from cooking she had an opportunity when I wasn't busy and wasted it. She and my mom both think I'm being immature.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my band mates to practice?
content: i’m on mobile so please forgive me. I (16F) have a band concert coming up. TBH, we’re not ready, but the show goes on i suppose.

Today we had our first dress rehearsal, this consists of me and my other band mates practicing on stage so we can adjust our volume and able to point out mistakes we can’t really make out in a crammed class room.

Our rehearsal needless to say went ok, but i noticed that every time we needed to stop, it’s because our flute section keeps playing either too early or too late. I’m in percussion so it doesn’t really affect me that much, but for others, it does because people lose track of where their parts are if certain parts aren’t on time.

We have a band group chat where we notify each other of band meets coming up, gigs, etc. One of my band mates texted the group chat saying that we did a great job today and to continue practicing. Later on, I texted the group chat and this is how it went:

me: flutes, please make sure you guys practice as well. i know it’s even more stressful on you guys considering almost all of y’all are seniors and the concert is coming up fast. but once this is over it’s smooth sailing from here ☺️

flute #1: I'm sorry that's kinda rude

flute #2: I have too agree no need to single anyone out pick up a flute and you'll see how hard our parts really are

me: i understand that. wasn’t my intention to be rude

AITA? it wasn’t my intention to be rude, i just want our concert to go as smoothly as possible considering this is most people’s last concert at the high school",yta
"title: AITA for telling my best friend that our friendship wouldn't be the same if she got into a relationship?
content:  Hello! I'll try to keep this short but to preface I'm in high school/everyone I'm talking about is 16-17, so while it might seem like a small issue this is like my whole life right now haha.

Okay but to get to the point, I have been friends with my best friend (I'll call her A) for like 5 years now. About a year ago we met some guys who go to our school and everyone got super close and would talk all the time. Everyone except one of the dudes (I'll call him N) at least, who hates me and has hated me since we met! Like he actively doesn't want me participating in things, he used to try and instigate fights between A and I. He doesn't talk to me or even acknowledge my presence, just sort of talks around me if that makes any sense. Not only that though, as I actually had a falling out with the other guy I talked to in that friend group. Sooo now none of them like me! Except my friend, who still talks with them.

But! All of that is to say that as of late, it seems like N has developed a massive crush for my friend. She's liked him for almost as long as we've known him so of course she's ecstatic. We had prom a couple days ago and they not only went together (as ""friends"") but he got her a custom corsage and they spent all night together. He serenaded her with some song he wrote to ask her out and was actually supposed to confess prom night, but pussied out I guess. They're basically dating without saying that, which would all be great! If it wasn't for the fact that this dude was and still is actively against my involvement in A's life. I really want to be happy for her, and I've tried! But I can't help but just feel hurt that she (whether she admits it or not) is choosing the guy who hates her best friend over her actual best friend. I know I'm not the only person in her life and I would never ever stop her from being happy just because I'm bitter and alone or something, but I just don't get it. I wouldn't have ever pursued a guy who hated her, but it's okay when someone hates me? Eventually though I messaged her about all of this and told her that while I wouldn't stop her, that her involvement with N will change the way I see her. I said that I'd support her regardless, but that I don't like and never would like their relationship.  She ended up saying that she feels guilty about it but that it was almost too far gone at this point since they already have feelings for eachother. 

My question with this is just whether I'm being unreasonable or not. Is this normal? Am I actually being selfish/do I need to just be okay with this?

Anyway thank you for your time, any input would be appreciated :)",yta

"title: AITA for telling my brother in law he's a walking advertisement for abortion?
content: My wife was more than five months pregnant when we learned that our daughter would not survive outside the womb. We were devastated, as this was a very wanted pregnancy. My wife made the difficult decision to have an induction abortion. The procedure itself went as expected, and she is physically fine. Emotionally, we are both still grieving. I was with her the whole time.

Yesterday, we had a family gathering. My family knew we were expecting, and I had the horrible job of telling them we had lost the baby. My parents and sister expressed their sympathies. However, bil, who is extremely pro-life, throughout the night told my wife repeatedly her that she was a murderer and that she killed her own daughter, and all sorts of other awful things that made her feel much worse. I was appalled when I caught him doing this, and my wife was on the verge of breaking down all over.

I yelled at him, pointing out how he had gotten a DUI in the past that put another person in the hospital, how he was working a low-paying job selling cigarettes that kill thousands of people every year at a convenience store, and how I had needed to bail him and my sister out financially more than once for medical reasons. Then I ended with ""If anything, you're a walking advertisement for abortion. Your mother probably wishes she had aborted you.""

I took my wife home, furious. Then later, I got a call from my sister. She apologized initially, saying she realized what her husband had said was out of line, but then tried to justify it by pointing out that he was raised to believe abortion was wrong. I should have been more understanding, and it was unfair of me to point out his past struggles when he had been doing better recently. I cussed her out and hung up, but now I'm wondering if I did go too far? AITA for basically telling my brother in law he should have been aborted?

Update: thank you all so much for the support. My sister called me a few hours ago, and we talked. It turns out she didn't know what he had actually said. He made it seem like he had just said he disagreed with abortion, which I would say is still unacceptable to tell grieving parents. But when I told her what he actually said, she was horrified. She apologized profusely and is now considering leaving him (there were a lot of other red flags in their relationship).

"title: AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic
content: UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!

So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.

1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers

2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way

3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.

4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.

5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.


ORIGINAL POST

A while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.

The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.

Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""

I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.

The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.

Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""

The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.

He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.

Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. 

Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?",info
"title: AITA for telling my brother that his crush dislikes him because he’s an asshole, not because he’s “too smart”?
content: So I have a younger brother (13) who is a child prodigy. I won’t give too many details but he’s well known in the academic circles of our country and attends an institute of higher education. Naturally people are impressed with his intelligence and he’s quite popular and makes friends easily. Our parents dote on him and have never told him “no”. As a result he has become very arrogant, condescending and disrespectful to people he deems below him...that’s just about everyone.  

Lately he’s been openly talking about a girl he’s crushing on and much to his dismay she’s quite unimpressed with him. He often complains to my parents and I about his failed attempts to befriend her. 

I understand why she dislikes him. On one occasion he invited her over for a school project and I overheard their interaction. He was constantly talking over her, dismissing her ideas and even calling them stupid. 99% of the time he was talking about himself and his accomplishments, being in news articles, his future plans are etc. The poor girl obviously seemed uncomfortable. He quizzed her about her career aspirations and when she answered he proceeded to point out it’s a bad career path. 

Today he was once again complaining about her and said that she’s obviously intimidated by his superior intellect. He claimed that all girls only like “stupid guys” and that “women are emotional”.  Sadly my parents agreed and kept assuring him that this girl is obviously uncomfortable with the fact he’s so accomplished and awesome.  


After hearing this nonsense many times, I finally told him that his crush dislikes him because he behaves like an obnoxious, know-it-all asshole. 
I explained that he’d probably have a chance if he showed some modesty instead of talking down on this girl so much. 

So my parents obviously think I’m an asshole for saying this. They said that it was horrible of me to say this to a 13 year old and that he’s just a child. I told them that he needs to realise that his personality is becoming a problem and that his crush dislikes him because he’s an AH, not because he’s “too smart”. AITA?",nta

But my fiancé and I made the decision to not allow kids/babies to our ceremony because they get bored, cry, won’t sit still, have tantrums... and I just don’t want that to happen during our wedding.

She’s trying guilt trip me into letting her bring her son. Saying “and I’ve confided in my best friends and they say it’s your wedding it’s your right to have it the way you want, but yeah. I just want you to know it’s not vengeance when I don’t come. I’ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.” I suggested that she take her son (he’s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says “I can’t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I’m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn’t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He’s too smart to manipulate.”

I’m not asking her to manipulate her son. I’m asking that she be an adult, and tell him he can’t come and that children aren’t allowed to attend, so she’ll take him to his friends while she’s gone.

Not to mention, that she’s angry that I didn’t choose her to be my Maid of Honor. I chose my step-sister. While on the phone, Sam said “I don’t mean any offense by this, but FUCK HER.” She’s literally only mad because my dad cheated on my mom 10 years ago and married the woman he cheated with. She hates my sister, because she hates my step mom. 

I ended up being on the phone with her for half an hour talking to her about this. With her constantly telling me “I’m trying to get sober, so I just wanted to talk to you and tell you how I feel.” Which to me, sounds like she’s going to blame me if I still tell her no, and she decides to drink/so drugs again. 

We ended the phone call with her saying “will you just promise me one thing, even if it’s a lie? Will you just promise me that you’ll consider it, and that you’ll talk to your fiancé about it?” So I told her yes, that I promised I’d consider it/talk to him about it. And I did, I considered it, I talked (angry cried) to him, and I’m not changing my mind. 

Am I the Asshole?

***************************************

UPDATE: I texted her two days ago, and used the wording suggested by u/sunny_sally. 

“There’s nothing I want more than for you to be at my wedding. I love (her son), but after speaking to (fiancé), we came to the conclusion that we still do not feel comfortable having kids at our wedding. This is a decision we made before we started the planning, knowing that some people might disagree with it. If you aren’t able to get a baby sitter, I would completely understand why you wouldn’t come. And I also spoke with (her step dad), he said he will be attending.”

She responded in less than a minute and said “ok.”

So I guess we’ll see how this goes.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my coworker to stop using my personal belongings?
content: So, I (28F) have been working at this small software company for about three years now, and I genuinely love my job. I have great coworkers and the work environment is generally positive. However, there is this one coworker, let's call her Sarah (32F), who has been increasingly crossing boundaries.

A bit of background, Sarah joined the company around a year ago, and we were initially friendly. We would have lunch together occasionally and chat about random things. I didn't think much of it, and it seemed like a normal office friendship. However, over time, I noticed that Sarah had started to use my belongings without asking for permission. For example, she would take my stapler, pens, or even my phone charger without asking. At first, I brushed it off as her just being forgetful and not realizing that these were my personal items. I tried to be understanding and not let it bother me.

But then, things started to escalate. One day, I brought in a special lunch I had prepared as a treat for myself. It was a dish that my grandmother used to make for me, and it had a lot of sentimental value. I had placed it in the fridge with a note clearly stating it was mine. When lunchtime came around, I discovered that Sarah had taken and eaten my lunch. I confronted her, and she apologized, claiming that she thought it was meant for the whole office to share. I didn't buy it, but I let it go to avoid causing a scene.

Over the next few months, Sarah's behavior continued to worsen. She began using my personal laptop without asking, even though we all have our own work computers. She would also use my coffee mug and other personal items, despite me having my name on them. I tried to address it politely and asked her to stop, but she would just laugh it off and say she didn't mean any harm.

Finally, I reached my breaking point last week. I had bought a new, expensive pair of headphones to use at work, and I had left them on my desk overnight. When I arrived the next day, I found Sarah using them at her desk. I was furious and asked her to hand them over immediately. She tried to play it off as a joke, but I had enough. I told her that it was not funny and that she needed to stop using my personal belongings without permission. I said it was disrespectful and a violation of my privacy.

The rest of the office heard the commotion and some of my coworkers agreed with me, while others said I was overreacting and should let it go. Sarah hasn't spoken to me since, and the atmosphere has become tense. A few coworkers have even suggested that I owe Sarah an apology for embarrassing her in front of everyone.

So, AITA for telling my coworker to stop using my personal belongings?",info
"title: AITA for telling my dad I don't like his mother?
content: 
Getting straight to the point I want to talk about my grandmother. She is the embodiment of those horrible MILs where the son doesn't stand up for his wife and I hate this. Last month my mom had an injury and the doctor advised her to take complete rest and to NOT work her arms AT ALL. My grandma also had a cataract surgery around the same time but she was fine. 

My mom cooks for all of us and the doctor told her not to for a while but my grandma complained about her eye. I don't know about it so i didn't comment but because of this my mom had to continue to cook. This resulted in more pain and now my mom cant even lift her arms and also can't stand because she is also really sick, so my dad finally realised she needed rest.

My grandma was now incharge of cooking and during lunch I noticed one of the dishes barely had salt and pointed it out to her. She was so mad for no reason and acted like it was my fault there was no salt in her own cooking. She told my dad some dramatized version of this and how I hate her. I heard the convo but didn't say anything, though I wondered how someone would make such a fuss over unsalted food.

Later my dad asked me if I was rude to my grandma and if I hate her to which I replied that I don't hate anybody but I do dislike her. He didn't say anything then but gives me the cold shoulder when I try to talk to him. My mom is saying I'm wrong and that I should apologize to just keep the peace but I am dead set that my grandma should apologize to her. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: I wanna say that my grandma was capable of cooking after 1 or 2 days according to my sister so I was angry that she could've done it and my mom wouldn't be in this situation. I realise my mistake and I will apologize to both of them.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my dad my mom’s BFF was more of a parent to me than him?
content: To give a little context:

When i was around 12yo (now 25F), my parents (43F and 48M) had another baby. 
Sadly the baby didn’t make it and passed away 2 days after birth.
It obviously took a toll on both my parents, my dad, him, started being less home than ever, not even during the night. My mom, her, got depressed and would just rarely get out of bed.
My dad being never home, I kinda had to take care of me and my mom.

Thankfully, one of my mom’s friend was coming as often as she could, to help me with making dinner, cleaning and sometimes even shower my mom. She taught me how to cook some things and would even stay over some nights while I was at hers with her husband and her daughter, to just decompress and take some time off I guess.

After a lot of therapy, my mom got better, apologized to me and I forgave her. She also thanked her BFF for being there for me when she didn’t.
My dad refused to go to therapy and I guess, counted coming back home more often as his apology.
My mom’s bff, her, never stopped being there for me and my mom.
I eventually moved out when I was 19 and got limited contact with my dad.

About now, 
I’m getting married soon and asked both my mom and her BFF to walk me down the aisle. 
They both agreed to it and we all kinda cried lol.

When I told my dad, he was seemingly upset and told me that it was very distasteful to have somebody other than my dad to give me away, especially if that someone was somebody who wasn’t even family. And that it might look like her and my mom were dating. 
I replied that, while he might not see my mom bff as family, I definitely saw the woman who took care of me and my mom, even tho she didn’t have to, as family. 
He then accused me of bringing up old drama and doing this just out of spite.
I said that my decision was not out of spite but out of feelings. I consider my moms bff more of a parent so I want her to walk me down the aisle alongside my mom.
He said that he was deeply hurt that I would see a random woman as a parent instead of him.
I then told him that the decision was done and nothing about it would change. 

He stormed out and that was the end of it.

But I guess he told my family before I could cause I received a bunch of messages from my grandparents (his parents) telling me that I was cruel to do this to him even tho he always did the best for me. And that if I was going trough with my decision they would not come.
My aunt and uncle also texted me that I should put my resentment on the side and let him walk me with my mom.

Both my husband and my mom said that it was my wedding and that I could choose whoever I wanted and they’d be okay with whatever I decide. 

But I think my dad also complained to my mom’s bff bc she told me that if I wanted to switch her n my dad, she’d completely understand.

I don’t want to switch bc I really want her here but I think maybe it’d be easier for everybody if I did. 

I’m completely at loss here and need some extra advices thank you.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my dad not to have sex in my apartment?
content: My dad (60M) separated from my mom (59F) 4 months ago after she found out he was a sugar daddy and cheating on her with multiple women. She rightly kicked him out of the house. I (30F) kindly let him stay at my apartment temporarily until my parents sell their house and he gets his own place. I'm temporarily living with my mom in my parents' house. Side note: my dad is 100% a narcissist and was emotionally abusive to me, my sibling (28M), and my mom growing up so he is not a nice guy.

A week ago he asked me if I would be okay if he got a girlfriend one day, I said sure you're an adult, whatever...he claims he went to therapy after the separation and seemed like he was trying to be a better person as of late but it could just be an illusion. The question sounded more like: would I be upset seeing him date someone else other than my mom, not if I was okay with him using my apartment for his dates.

So I went to my apartment recently to grab some stuff while he was on a business trip (he gave me permission to go there whenever I want, I mean it is my place). I found women's lingerie, pyjamas, and a dress hanging in a closet where I store my luggage. So I felt super gross about the fact the he's having sex with someone in my bed in my apartment.

I texted him about it and at first he apologized but then passive aggressively said he felt uncomfortable when I had sex with my bf in my early twenties in a spare room in the basement so he said it was a similar situation and should have known better. Knowing how he is, I knew better and could tell he was trying to shift the blame from himself to me.

I'm wondering if I'm in the right to tell him to not have sex in my apartment, or if I'm being hypocritical?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my dad's wife she needs to accept she is not a mother and is not entitled to demand a dance at my wedding?
content: My dad married Sandy when I was 16. Sandy has no kids. She was upset to learn that I mostly went to my grandparents house after school and that I wanted to continue that when she moved in, something I had been doing since my mom died when I was 4. I'm close to my grandparents. My mom was their only child and I'm their only grandchild. So maybe that made us a little closer or maybe it's just all the time we spent together. But anyway, that was a time when Sandy wanted me to be home after school instead of at my grandparents because she wanted the chance to have some ""mother son time"" and she said she was taking her role as my mother seriously. I told her it was nice and all but she wasn't my mother and that was okay, not to stress it. A few weeks after that exchange she told me about her first marriage. How she raised her stepkids from the time they were elementary schoolers to teenagers and then her husband died and they wanted to be with blood family and cut all contact with her. She was like I know you're older and all but I have always wanted to be a mother and you lost yours when you were 4, so why not let me be your new mother and we can both get what we need. I told her that was not something I needed and sorry. 

I know she was never happy about that. She always kept trying to push that boundary. She would introduce herself as my mom, me her son and would talk about being a boy mom. I never wanted a new mom and always made that clear.

It was a couple of weeks ago that things turned a little nasty. She heard I was doing a special dance with my grandma at my wedding in November and told me she deserved a dance too. She said she's the person who is in the position of mom, she's the future grandmother of my children and she deserves her chance to be honored with something public like that. She told me I am a young man and need to learn how to treat a woman who has been in the role of my mom for a decade now. I laughed which only made her angry. She told me she was demanding a dance after everything she has done for me. This is when I told her that she needs to accept she is not a mother, that as sad as it is, she can't make it happen with someone else's child and that she is not entitled to demand a dance at my wedding since she is not a mother or a parent to me.

She said knowing what she has been through I should be ashamed of myself for talking to her like that. My dad called me after and asked if there was anything I could give her to make her feel better because she's really hurt.

"title: AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad [50M].
content: My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it. 

I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my daughter that I’m disappointed in her?
content: Hello all.

It’s been rough with my only daughter as of late.

My husband and I (both of us are 55) have one daughter (30F). We have been married coming up on 32 years soon. 

My daughter was in a long relationship and married for approximately 9 years, and for a long time I thought that is was a good relationship, when out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband. 

We were told it was a mutual decision, but that ultimately, he wasn’t the greatest partner, and there were many things that she was not satisfied with in their relationship. So she wanted to leave. We supported her decision.

About a year after the divorce, she introduced us to her new boyfriend. And while my husband and I thought it may be a bit early to date, we decided to continue to support her and meet him. He was, and is a very charming man who treats our daughter wonderfully, and you can tell she is extremely happy.

Now to the argument. Recently, we were talking with one of our daughters friends who was visiting our town, and were discussing our daughters job and her wonderful boyfriend. Her friend in the conversation made a comment about how they were lucky to be in the same orientation together when they started work.

As soon as she saw our confused faces, she gave us the full story, as she realized we hadn’t been given it. Our daughter had told us while her and her boyfriend worked for the same employer, they didn’t meet until after the divorce.

We pressed the friend for more information, and she begrudgingly told us that our daughter and her boyfriend had met during orientation at work while our daughter was going through her marital issues. This led to them becoming closer and her filing for divorce from her ex husband about a year later.

So later that day, I asked to have a conversation with my daughter and brought up what her friend had told us. She turned white as snow, and basically confirmed her friends story. But reiterated that there was no physical cheating.

I told her that physical cheating was not the only way that you could hurt someone. And that it appeared that she had emotionally cheated on her ex husband. He may not have been the greatest person, but it didn’t excuse her actions. I told her that I was disappointed in her, and while I supported her leaving a bad marriage, that I couldn’t look at her and her boyfriend the same in this new light in regards to cheating. I still love her and will treat her boyfriend with respect, but it is definitely something I have a hard time looking past.

She got angry with me for not continuing to support her in her journey beyond divorce.

"title: AITA for telling my daughter to get over herself?
content: I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

My son says I’m being terrible and I need to re-evaluate my life. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for telling my elder sister to walk home instead of going through the effort of picking her up and driving her home?
content: For important context, it's common in my country for singles to still live with family. In fact, moving out while single is considered a bit odd and a sign of poor relations.

With that out of the way, she went with my parents for some medical tests, her included, while I held the fort at home. The lab is roughly 600 meters away, which I think is a reasonably short walking distance given the weather, and the family (air conditioned) office (which I am not working for) is in the same compound, though they all decided to take one of the cars to the lab anyway. The weather is 29 degrees celsius: Somewhat hot, but hardly unreasonable for short walks in my opinion at least, or I simply have an unusually high tolerance for heat, which is where the question comes in.

My sister finished early, waited in the family office to cool off and she wanted to get back home since she was getting bored waiting for my parents to finish their tests, and rang me if I could get the car and fetch her. Now, for more context, at the time, she was wearing a t shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers. 

At the time, I was still working (from home, since I'm working for an offshore company), and it wasn't break time yet, so I told her that she could probably just walk back home by herself. At that moment, she got angry, told me I was being heartless and unreasonable for asking her to walk home in the clothes she was wearing goven the weather, and hung up, and simply chose to wait the extra hour for my parents to finish up and drive home with her.

I had the strongest desire to point out that when I fresh out of college, and couldn't sustain the cost of fuel by myself if I kept driving to work everyday, I walked that exact distance regularly at all kinds of weather to the bus stop while wearing similar clothing. At this point, I'm not sure if I was just desensitised to the weather and would just be adding fuel to the fire, if she's the one who's too used to being driven in air conditioned vehicles and simply overreacting, or maybe there's something else I'm not seeing",nta
"title: AITA for telling my ex his lack of money is not my issue?
content: I (36F) have a daughter Sadie (12) with my ex-husband John (39). We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.

I have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. 

Well, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.

The problem came when I went to pick her up last weekend.I had a business meeting and couldn't drive her over, so Amanda offered to just pick Sadie up from school, which hadn't happened before. When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.

They sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.

I told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.

They've been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me a selfish AH, and after telling the story to a friend, he told me I was rubbing my success in their face, but I still don't feel like I did anything wrong. Still, AITA?

EDIT: I got temporary guardianship while waiting for a court hearing. We're going to try to get full custody and have John get one day a week of visitation, supervised for at least the first few months, and no contact with Amanda or her kids.This way, he still sees Sadie just as much and they can try to repair their relationship, but she doesn't have to go back there. All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back. I've talked to Sadie and we've decided that she's going to try therapy for a little while to help deal with everything that's happened.

UPDATE: We've had the hearing and our custody arrangement's been modified. Any and all decisions relating to Sadie are made by me, and me alone. John has supervised visitation once a week, and Sadie will continue in therapy to deal with all the issues Amanda and co. have caused her. 

They tried to push for 50/50 custody split on grounds of alienation (so me trying to put Sadie against her father), but we made it clear from the start that we wanted to keep Amanda and her children away, and wanted supervision only because we don't feel safe leaving him alone as of yet, but that we were open to modifications. Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. 

Amanda's pissed, and has tried to contact me and Sadie, but I made it clear to her that if she keeps harrassing me or my daughter, I'll have to make this known to the authorities. Sadie and I have blocked her everywhere, and any communication between John and us is made through text messages or emails only. 

I'd like to thank you all for your support throughout all of this, it really means a lot to us. Sending you loads of love!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?
content: We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",info
"title: AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?
content: Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.

Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""

I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""

He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""

I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""

The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""

He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.

I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?

He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.

So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""

He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.

Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.

AITA?

**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.

Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.

The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.

Also, we don't do Christmas. 

Check your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened.",info
"title: AITA for telling my fiancé that he had it easier than me growing up?
content: My fiancé (29M) and I (28NB) have been together for 14 years. Despite growing up in the same area we come from very different backgrounds.

For context, my parents are addicts. My mother, in particular, was very neglectful. My parent divorced as soon as I was old enough to remember it. Living with my mom, our house was a wreck. Our water got turned off sometimes. I had to grow up quickly to endure my childhood, definitely too quickly, and while I’ve suffered for it, I’ve learned how to get over issues fairly quickly in my daily life.

On the other hand, my fiancé grew up with his parents in a loving marriage. There was very minimal conflict in his home. His parents paid for his college, let him live at home rent-free as long as he needed, and he never experienced the kind of trauma I went through. I’m genuinely happy that he hasn’t been through that but sometimes it makes understanding each other tough.

Recently we’ve been having issues that are out of our control. I have health problems that make housework hard for me, he’s had a hard semester at school for a second degree, and we’ve been caring for a sick pet.

My fiancé came home the other day in a very bad mood and I asked what was wrong. He refused to explain. I asked how I could help or if he wanted to be left alone. All he’d say is that I couldn’t help and that he’s upset because “things keep happening.” I tried to gently explain that things will keep happening, that’s just part of life and actively stressing about it will just make it worse. He’s usually the type of person who needs and asks for tough love, hence my response. He got upset and said that he doesn’t want things to keep happening, and that he thought that now that his semester was over everything else would stop too. I, admittedly, got frustrated, because it often feels like he doesn’t know how to cope with problems when they don’t go away immediately and I got snippy with him. I told him that he’s having trouble coping with issues as an adult because he didn’t have to deal with them growing up since he had it so much easier than I did and that he needs to learn how to handle them since he won’t tell me how to help him.

He didn’t say anything then, but last night, when I was upset I asked for some comfort, and he said he didn’t want to comfort me after what I’d said to him the other day. I’m honestly not sure if what I said was too much.

"title: AITA for telling my flatmates what to do all the time?
content: I see a lot of problems that need addressing but I try and pick my battles so I don't come off as bossy.

The main one is that they don't turn on the kitchen fan when they're cooking so I end up smelling their food all the way from my room (because of a small crevice in the doorframe that lets a lot of air in) especially when I'm sleeping. I often go into the kitchen and ask them to turn it on politely like ""hey do you mind just keeping the fan on while you cook, I just don't want the smell stinking up my room is all"", and they argue with me that it's loud and unnecessary.

And then it'll be other things like wiping the counter when they're done. I always find it greasy with bits of food lying around. They probably just forget and that's why I keep reminding them and now I'm being called bossy

Just yesterday, I went into the kitchen and saw one of them finished cooking but the smell was still lingering pretty strong. I turned the fan on full, and he turns it off as soon as I walk away. He says ""I'm already done cooking, why are you turning it on?""

I told him it's because the smell is still travelling around the house and he says ""alright, whatever you say, dictator""

"title: AITA for telling my friend I don’t care what she thinks about my hair
content: This is kind of stupid but I feel like I want a little bit more of peoples opinion

So basically I have curly hair

And no it’s not wavy that looks like it curls,it’s noticeable that my hair is curly

My friend however (Lola) has straight hair

Her hair is a lot thinner than mine, not thin to the point she’s balding because we’re both not even near the age for that to happen but her hair outlines her head shape while mine only outlines the top and my head shape becomes less noticeable 

Lola has always been one of those people who will criticize you and say “I’m just being honest” even tho when someone treats them the same they get upset

She’s that kind of person

So a few days ago I we saw eachother in our 3rd period but I was talking to my friend who was behind me

Me and Lola used to be a lot closer but one thing led to another and now we’re starting to drift apart

Anyways I had washed my hair that morning so the curls were nice and defined

She had said she liked them and as I was about to say thank you she said “I love your curls but they’re like really flat.. just saying”

Honestly this isn’t the first time she’s commented something like this, I was obviously sick of her and her commentary that no one asked for

So I’m return I said “I don’t care bro and plus look at your hair it’s way flatter than mine-?”

She responded with something like “i was just being honest u don’t have to act like that”

I can’t really remember what I said back to her but I do remember she turned around to her boyfriend and he called me an “angry bitch”

Honestly I hate her boyfriend with my heart and soul and I wish he gets hit by a car but that’s beside the point

"title: AITA for telling my friend I had unexpected plans and had to cancel ours?
content: Me (25F) had initially agreed to the plans my friend (23F) had made for us. Since our birthdays were right next to each other, we thought it would be a good idea to celebrate together. I initially had agreed because it seemed like a good idea. Our birthday is two months from now. However, last night, my parents told me they’d appreciate if I spent my birthday with them this year since I haven’t been able to since I started working at 20. I felt bad and agreed. I immediately told my friend this and communicated how I wanted to make it up to her. She immediately shut off and acted silent and distant. She said it was okay but she left me on read when I tried to ask if everything was ok. I don’t understand? Would she rather I lied to her? Or tell her last minute? Did she expect that I’d say no to my parents and go with her instead?

Edit: A lot of people have been saying I should add more context so here it is (sorry this is my first time posting!) 

My friend planned a two day weekend trip for her birthday and since our birthdays were next to each other, she figured we’d celebrate it together. I agreed and we looked into some things we could do. Everything is still at the planning stage at this point. I also need to clarify that the trip isn’t ONLY the two of us, of course. We have other girls coming who are mostly her friends since this was originally her idea (I don’t mind either, I don’t have much friends and her friends are super civil with me). However, when my parents called recently and asked if it’s okay for me to celebrate with them for the first time in five years, I couldn’t say no. I’ve been working non-stop since I migrated and now that I had the money to fly back to my home country, being on the vacation with my friend just felt wrong. I also owe a lot to my parents since they’ve worked day and night to be able to bring me to where I am now. I also do work 7 times a week because I have 3 different jobs I attend to. 

Of course I told my friend this, but she acted cold and distant. It’s been five days and I’ve been trying to contact her but she’s left me on read and blocked me on some of our socials. It really hurts me that she couldn’t see my side even if I was really understanding of hers. I know it was hurtful for me to cancel but I didn’t entirely ghost her. In fact, I told her that we can celebrate another way in another time where it could be just the two of us since I felt so bad. I’ve already said sorry but I was also hoping she’d also understand my part. When you’ve been financially struggling all your life and when you’re finally able to afford to give back to your parents, this really was an opportunity I couldn’t pass out on.

Update: Been reading all your replies and it really has given me a wider and broad POV with this whole situation! I do see the error of my mistakes in this and have been taking accountability. I really did try to communicate right away on what i can do to make it up to her (and if we can find a compromise) however, it seems like she really isn’t willing. I can’t really force her to forgive me but I’m glad I got to share this entire situation with this community ◡̈",yta
"title: AITA for telling my friend I’ve thought about proposing to my girlfriend of over a year?
content: Really what you see is what you get with this story. I [20M] told my friend [21F] while we were on the phone that I proposed to my girlfriend [19F]. I meant it as a joke, and remarked after a minute that I was joking, but then seriously stated that I have thought of proposing to her and would like to someday. 

My friend instantly said that that statement made her confused and uncomfortable and has been refusing to talk to me for the rest of the day. I’m not sure what I did wrong here, or maybe I touched a nerve. I feel bad because I didn’t think it was that serious and am prone to making jokes that I fail to think about before saying. 

AITA?

Edit: for people asking for more info:

1. The joke might’ve come off as more serious. That’s my fault completely. I guess I really didn’t realize how seriously people take that kind of declaration. I just thought because of my age she wouldn’t believe me but obviously that’s not an assumption I can make out of nowhere. 

2. I was making the joke to probe what her reaction would be, and while I didn’t expect one of overwhelming joy and excitement, I definitely didn’t expect it to be one of discomfort. 

3. This is my best friend. She’s gone on dates and has had crushes on multiple people. We have been friends for over 6 years. If she is secretly in love with me, that would make me beyond uncomfortable, and I really hope that’s not the case.

Edit 2: I’ll add this for the people asking for the context of the conversation up until that point: nothing. We were just shooting the shit on a phone call and I said “I proposed to my girlfriend”. At first she was silent and then responded “what? Are you serious?” And I said “yup”. And then she was dead silent so I noticed I messed up and said “I’m just kidding, but I’d like to someday” and she just hasn’t spoken to me since.

Final edit: we talked it out and I learned she has an unhealthy obsession with me. She said she knew I was joking, she just felt herself getting furious and frustrated and angry that’s she couldn’t control my love life. Thanks for the comments.",info
"title: AITA for telling my friend group that one friend had changed?
content: I (19F) just got back from my first year at college. In high school, I was part of a friend group that was mostly connected through social justice. We weren't exactly ""popular"" (ok, we weren't popular at all), but we all felt a strong sense of empowerment and community with each other and we were very close. We had one friend, ""D"", who was a lot more involved with the popular crowd being a cheerleader, but she was also very politically active and was super outgoing and bubbly, whereas the rest of us were a lot more reserved, so we kind of needed her in the group to initiate ""hang outs"" and things of that nature, and she is a genuinely nice person.

Right now, she and I are the only two people from our group that have come home for the summer, so we planned a little get-together for lunch. I had figured that broadening her social scope and being in a more ""adult"" environment in college would bring her ""cheerleader"" side down a bit and raise her social justice side more, since that tends to happen in college, and that would make her more similar to the rest of us. However, as soon as we sat down and started talking, I could tell that college had the opposite effect on her. Whereas I had thrown myself into politically-leaning clubs and activities that had challenged me to think philosophically, she had joined a sorority and, as bad as it sounds, become slightly air-headed. I quickly realized that we simply were no longer compatible as friends. There was nothing wrong with me or her, but we just wouldn't be able to continue the friendship due to how far our personalities had grown apart. I texted her that night to tell her this, and she seemed to understand and accept that.

Here is where the conflict arises: the rest of our friends will also be arriving home within the next 2 weeks. D texted the group to see if anyone would be interested in hanging out (this was not directed towards me, of course). Knowing my friends, I knew that none of them would have much more luck with her than I did, and I felt that they had the right to know what they were getting into. I texted them all to let them know that D had changed and how, and we agreed that they would tell her honestly that they couldn't continue their friendships with her either and why. 

I didn't think D would be upset as she wasn't when I had said the same to her, but she was actually really mad at me for ""telling them what their opinions of her should be"" and that she would be much more okay with this if they had come to this decision on their own accords. I can understand this, but at the same time, I felt as though they had the right to know who she was now.

I (14m) have a friend(14m) that does not study at all and is failing most of his classes. Every day after school we all play video games together and all of us get average to above average grades except for him who fails almost all his classes. Our finals exams have started yesterday and we continuously urge him to study even during his free time yet he never listens to us. We all study together in a group at set times every evening. Everyone studies except for him who usually wastes his time on his laptop.

Yesterday we told him that we would let him play with us only if he promised to study hard during study hours. He agreed and we played together and when we were studying he continued to waste his time and did very minimal studying.

Tomorrow he has a very important exam in a subject that he is failing, and he does not realize how important this exam is to his future. He wanted to play with us again today. We told him that he has to study and that he cannot play with us today. He started arguing with us saying things like, ""Why should you care about my life?"" so we told him that we are his friends and we care about him, because we have known him for a long time and if he doesn't want us to care about him then there is no point in continuing to be friends with him. To which he responded, ""If you're not going to play with me than I can just play by myself"", at which point we told him that we are not going to talk to him until he starts taking his studies seriously. He started getting mad at us and started saying that we were being unfair. At which point we told him that if he is not going to change, then he can kindly get out of my room.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my friend not to play a song with her band?
content: My(f15) best friend Emily (f15) is a drummer in a band and the friend mentioned in the title. The lead singer of the band Chloe (f15) wrote a song about having a crush on my sister(f15). This in itself is a little uncomfortable for me but harmless. However, Chloe decided to play the song in fort of our entire year group. Once again it is a little weird but would be harmless, if she hadn’t already told lots of people in our year group who the song was about. The titular character in the song had an extremely close name to my sisters name, and now many people think that Chloe has a crush on my sister. This is problematic in two ways because my sister doesn’t like girls and Chloe is in a relationship. 

Emily told me they were preforming the song a few days before. I told my sister who was already aware that Chloe had a prior crush on her because she is also aware of the song and i was trying to make sure that she was prepared for it. 

When Emily told me, I expressed how I thought it would make my sister uncomfortable and how they(the band) weren’t considering other people. But they preformed it anyway today. 

After the preference (in an assembly) I went to Emily and expressed again how it made my sister uncomfortable and how everything was already putting the pieces together and figured it was my sister. Another rumor that has been spreading is that Chloe still has a crush on my sister. 

Throughout all this, Emily was saying how Chloe no longer has a crush on my sister so it’s fine. She also kept bringing up that point that it is no different from any other love song and that Chloe just really wanted to preform the song. She told me that not everyone would know it’s about my sister and how it would be ok. 

I don’t know if i am over reacting to the song being played or if it is really not a big deal. And I don’t think i have a place to say if they can or can’t play a song.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my friend she needs to get over it?
content: Throwaway account.

My (28F) best friend, Sarah (28F), is getting married next month.  I am the MOH.  We have been friends for about 10 years.  Her family is like my second family. They've included me in holidays when I couldn't make it to my own family, and they have yearly family reunions that they always invite me to.  Point being, I know the whole family quite well.  So, Her cousin, Cassie (26F), has been engaged for about a year.  And we just found out last week that she and her fiancé decided to move their wedding up.  It's now two weeks after Sarah's wedding.  When Sarah heard this, she freaked out, saying that Cassie was trying to steal her spotlight, and take all of the attention away.  This is very unlike Sarah's personality.  She's typically a very chill person, who doesn't make a big deal about things.

Now, when she called Cassie to yell at her, Cassie said that she and her fiancé made the decision to move the date up because of their grandpa (both Sarah and Cassie's grandpa).  They are very close to him, and he is very elderly and ill.  No one is really sure how much time he has left.  When Cassie originally booked a venue, she even specifically chose it because it would be easily accessible by her grandpa.  They venue happened to have a cancelation or something, and all of the planning worked out, so they were able to move it up. It is so important to both Sarah and Cassie that their grandpa is at their weddings, so Cassie wanted to make sure that it was in a time frame when he would still be alive.  

Sarah was still livid.  And this is literally ALL I've been hearing about for the past week.  I've been trying really hard to play the good friend and MOH role and just listen, but personally, I think Sarah is being ridiculous.  So, I finally had enough and told her that she needed to get over it.  We all know why Cassie moved the wedding, it makes sense that she did, and as far as any of us know, everyone who is invited to both weddings is still going to both weddings (so it's not like people canceled on Sarah's wedding to go to Cassie's).  Sarah got so angry with me.  She told me to leave, and that she will have to reconsider my role in her wedding.  I was honestly shocked at her reaction, because it's so unlike her.

"title: AITA for telling my friend she was overstepping and to keep her opinions to herself?
content: My (f26) friend (f27) and I had an argument and I want to know if I was wrong or she was overstepping.

Some days ago I had an argument with my boyfriend (m26) regarding food, the argument is unimportant, he did say some hurtful stuff to me and I was very angry at him. When I was angry I told my friend about the fight, she let me vent and agreed that he was wrong and suggested me to re think the relationship since we have only been living together for a short while (little over a month) and I don't deserve to be treated how he treats me. However, after that my boyfriend apologized, we spoke and I forgave him. Since then we have been doing better, we're not fighting over who cooks anymore since he wants to do it and I let him (and honestly he's a better cook than I am, so it's best for the two of us)

Yesterday I went out to have breakfast with my friend. She asked me how things were between my boyfriend and I (I told her before though text that we were ok) so I told her we were doing great and I told her I am glad that we were able to sort this out since I love him, we have been dating for nearly two years and I can't imagine not being with him. 

Then she told me ""that good, although I still don't think you should've forgave him"" I told her he apologized and she said that still she would never let a man talk to her like my boyfriend spoke to me. I told her he doesn't always talk like that, we were angry and of course things got out of control but nothing else happened, we're fine. She doubled down that I was kinda an asshole to myself for forgiving him. I told her she was overstepping and she should keep her opinions to herself. We argued and I ended up telling her that she's a bitch and thats why none of her relationships work out. She got very angry, called me an asshole again and left. 

I know what I told her was hurtful, but I would've never told her so if she would've just drop the subject when I asked her to. Our friends group are kinda divided now, some have took her side because I went too far, some have took my side because she was overstepping. So am I really an asshole or is she?

Edit: my boyfriend and I argued because I wanted to prepare food for him as my ""love language"" to him since he appreciates eating some nice food, however I am not good at it, I have been cooking for us since we moved in together. He got tired of it and asked me to stop and let him cook, I got upset, he told me my food tastes like shit (or something along those lines) I told him I was trying my best and he asked me how could I mess up a simple recipe. I got angry and stopped talking to him. Later he apologized and we're fine now. He's not abusive or controlling, food is a delicate matter to him, he's a cook and his parents are too so he's used to eat very good food, now he's cooking and I'm showing my love to him in a different way. This argument is very dumb.",yta

At the start of 2023 we let them know were taking the kids to Disneyland and cant make  the trip.  We were an 1 income home, now we have 2 incomes.  Later I said that we can take the trip, friend said that she needs to talk to her partner about it, her partner was hurt thinking we did not want to go with them &they had made different plans. 
I said that we want to go to the trip and 1 income was our issue, we looked forward to it &we all cherished that time. Friend understood, we looked &we thought on taking the trip after Memorial Day. On March we didn’t settle the rental.
Easter I find out I need surgery my husband said that we would not be able to take a vacation. I had not met with my friend, rental was not settled nor I had mentioned surgery. 
Mid April friend messaged she had made the reservation dates were taken, new dates were nothing close to what we had previously talked, they were in the middle of a working week.  I asked if she would get the a refund if cancelled, I explained the surgery and that it would be a very heavy expense. She asked me if we had changed our minds about the trip, I explained that we did not, health issues had been making me miserable and we had to plan for my surgery. She said I should have told her we were having doubts about the trip. I told her we had not doubts about it and that she was right, I should’ve communicated better with her about the change. I told her I wish she would’ve also let me know she was going to do the reservation and that I would’ve brought my situation right away. She then said she understood the surgery and that communication was definitely lacking, she mentioned that back on December we had said we didn’t want to make the trip and that her and her partner changed their plans,  then I said we did want to go and they had changed their plans again to be able to go on the yearly trip. She said she reserved it thinking we would be able to get the days off since they’re literally the only days available that it was her mistake and she would try to cancel it. I apologized for putting us on the situation, I explained that it has never been that we don’t want to take a trip with them and  I hope they do see that I said we love going on vacations with them. I told her she’s my best friend and I love having our kids and us together doing things we all love at the beach. I said I was really looking forward to being able to spend another year at the beach with them and I feel really bad that money was our issue. I told her I hope we can both see this thing as learning to do better with our communication and not let it strain us apart.

She did not reply to my apology, I know I should’ve communicated I was going to have a surgery and couldn’t make it to the trip I genuinely apologized about it. AITA?",nta

content: Still high-school students here, so you'll obviously see lots of immaturity.

My friend, let's call him Mohammed, decided to run away from home. He gave us his reason, it was because he got into an argument with his parents because he got caught vaping and smoking weed for the 7th time. He lost access to all of his electronics so naturally he was upset, and decided to go to run away from home. When he came to school, he told us he was kicked out of his house, but by the end of the day he clarified he was exaggerating and just didn't want to go home. My friend, who I'll call Evan, decided to drive Mohammed home to his house, and then take him into town. I got home and around 30 minutes later I get a call from Mohammed's phone. His mother is on the other end literally crying saying she can't find her son. She's worried sick so I give her Evan's number and tell her he was last with Evan and went out into town with him.

I do not know what Evan told this woman but all I know is he said something along the lines of ""Mohammed isn't with me but he's somewhere safe with a few friends"" which was a lie. I go to the gum 1.5 hours later and get a text from Mohammed's mom. She's still looking for him. I figured Evan would have told the truth so I was confused. I texted her back saying that I'd help her in any way I can but I had no idea where he was since Evan left with him and told her Evan would know for sure. She then told me what Evan said and I told her I couldn't help in that case but could ask some friends. I get home frome the gym and Evan calls me, explains he lied, I lose my shit at him and Mohammed and tell them they're being incredibly stupid and they need to come clean ***right now***. Mohammed, high again, mumbles something and Evan goes ""bro Mohammed knows what's best for him"". They roll into my driveway and Evan goes ""oh btw Chris I'm at your house, can you give me the tent so Mohammed can sleep in it."" 10:30pm, around 2°C, and Mohammed is going to sleep in a tent.

Evan calls his girlfriend as a last effort and she kept saying no, Mohammed can not stay here, until Evan puts her on the spot and puts her on speaker and says Mohammed is in the car too and she finally relents and says yes. After this I got pissed so I called them morons, told them goodnight, and went inside. I immediately texted Mohammed's mother and said I knew where he is and gave her the address he was staying at, as well as my address just incase. Mohammed's aunt calls me and asks me a few questions which I happily answer and she thanks me and says goodbye. Mohammed's mother picked him up and she texts me profusely thanking me. Igo to school today and I keep hearing about how I ""snitched in Mohammed bro"" to which I responded that my decision if Mohammed didn't want that to happen, he could quit smoking weed and not away from home and getting high and lying to his family.

"title: AITA for telling my friend’s secret to other friends?
content: This was about a month ago now but here goes. So in my friend group one of the guys, we’ll call him josh, and one of the girls, we’ll call her Sarah, had just started talking to each other and it was clear that they both liked each other. After a while of that even though they weren’t officially together they’d both agreed to be exclusive with each other and do nothing sexual with anyone else. Now I’m a lot closer to Sarah than I am with Josh and when her mental health isn’t great she doesn’t talk to anyone at all and wants to be left alone. She also didn’t talk Josh in this time at all. Josh had been messaging me and my other friends about this because it was having a bad affect on his mental health. Even though he liked her he understood if she didn’t want to be in their…whatever sort of relationship you’d call it but he just wanted her to tell him that but she wouldn’t. One day out of nowhere Sarah texted me and told me she’d just slept with someone. She claims it wasn’t because he offered her free weed but we aren’t certain. I asked Sarah if she was ever going to tell Josh and she said no because it would complicate things however she was going to tell him about why she hasn’t texted him and that she doesn’t want to be in this relationship anymore. I agreed that she should end the relationship however I did say she should tell Josh about the guy she slept with but she didn’t want to. One day all the boys from the friend group were having a night together and it was clear that Josh was upset and he said he was unsure what to do about Sarah. I found out that Sarah still hadn’t told him that she wants to end their relationship so I pulled him aside and told him everything. Sarah doesn’t wanna be with you, Sarah basically cheated on you etc. As upset as he was he was glad that I told him and said he was going to talk to her. Before he had a chance to do that I told Sarah that I told Josh about her sleeping with her ‘drug dealer.’ She was upset about that and then when Josh did confront her she told him that she was gonna tell him, despite telling me that she wasn’t. She hasn’t spoken to me or the majority of our friend group since. Whether I’m the AH or not, I don’t regret telling Josh.

My future MIL and SIL were like what the hell is this, this isn't a bachelorette party. They asked me why I didn't include them and why my sister handled the whole thing. I said my sister is my MOH (and only bridesmaid technically) and she wanted to do this for me. They know mine and my sister's history, they are aware that this is what I planned for hers when she was getting married. They also know I'm not a very formal kind of person or a party animal. But both of them claimed this was a childish party and not something a future bride should be doing to celebrate her engagement or wedding. They told me it might be understandable that a teenager who knows no better would arrange something like this but a grown woman in her 30s should know better. I told them they did not have to be rude and my sister was planning something I would enjoy instead of something she knows I won't have fun during.

They were complaining that they are too old, too offended and all kinds of other comments about the party. They are yet to RSVP to my sister also. So when they complained to me repeatedly I told them nobody is forcing them to come and if it is so offensive to them, RSVPing no is a valid choice and nobody will give them crap for it.

They told me we will all be family soon and I should not be so casually telling them I do not want them there. Their comment annoyed me when they had been bitching about it for a while. But maybe I am TA for this. My fiance told his mom and sister they are being crazy over the top and ridiculous and that not everything will be exactly how they want it. They told him what I said and how I am telling my future family their presence is not wanted. He shrugged them off. But I do have to ask still AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it makes her uncomfortable?
content: My late best friend and I knew each other since we were little. We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.

One day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren’t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.

A few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our ""wedding anniversary"" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.

4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.

Today was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it’s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.

I was furious at her comments because she wasn’t just a “dead girl”. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It’s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.

When I told her that I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came back home yet.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend she can't just take back a replacement item she gave to me after the lost item was found?
content: 
My girlfriend and I had a long debate about this quite a while ago, and it still remains a touchy subject in our relationship. Please weigh in. (FYI: busy day ahead, won't be able to check responses until way late tomorrow).


Situation: my girlfriend lost my volleyball when she borrowed it during one of our routine league nights. She offered to replace it at no cost to me, since she acknowledged the ball going missing was entirely her fault. True to her word, she gifted me a new ball before our next league night. 

Note: She *physically* gave the replacement ball to me and it was now in my possession (ie. it is now ""my"" ball). 

When we got to our league later on (-perhaps later that day or the following day, I forget which TBH), my lost ball had been found by the staff and my girlfriend handed it back to me. At which point, she also said: ""I'm going to take back the other ball now"" and went to take it from my bag. I told her it wasn't ok for her to do that and challenged her on that point.


Her POV: According to her, as I was no longer missing my original ball, so it was ok for her to take back the replacement ball.

She believes that by returning my original ball, the 'debt' is settled, and since the replacement was no longer necessary for me to possess, it was hers to keep now as she had paid for it.
 

My POV: Once you give something to someone, you no longer have ownership of said item, as that has ownership has been transferred over to the recipient. Therefore, what happens with that item from that point on is not for the giver to decide.

I believe that for her to (re-)assume ownership of something she has given away to be a huge transgression on her part. Taking  back a gift is a big no-no in my eyes. My gripe is that I feel like she should have asked for the replacement ball back, rather than have assumed ownership of it outright.

If I wanted to donate the ball, or, heck, even just keep it for myself, I feel it would have been my prerogative to do so, not hers.

Now, to clarify:

1- As she had given me the ball as a replacement and the original had been found, _I feel the morally correct thing for me to do would have been to offer the replacement ball back to her_ , as a token for her generosity in the first place. However, she had 'robbed' me of this opportunity by deciding to take back the replacement ball before I could offer it back to her. 

2- If she had not yet given me the ball (ie. she had purchased it but have not yet physically given it to me) before returning my original ball, I feel she would have been within her rights to keep the replacement, as ownership hadn't been transferred over to me through the act of giving.

So, AITA?

(Final word: I gave her the ball because of clarification point #1.)

Update: My girlfriend and I are currently reading the comments together and we are having an absolute laugh!  We didn't anticipate such a high volume of responses (over 1000 at this point!)! She feels validated. 🤣 There were definitely lots of points for us -and me in particular- to reflect on. I can't get back to everybody, but I will be responding to as many as I can over the next few days.

Also, not that it matters much, but the volleyball is worth ~$90 CDN.

To those mentioning autism/mental health issues ... I've already had some concerns over being on the spectrum before. Categories and the 'pedantics' of things are things I worry/stress about very often, much more than those around me. Thank you for pointing that out and making room for this in the conversation. Perhaps this is worth me looking into further.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend she isn’t welcome at my house anymore unless she seriously fixes her attitude regarding my best friend?
content: Disclaimer: no, I am not seeking relationship advice or validation on it. I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. 

I (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It’s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it’s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We’ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It’s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn’t impact how I see him. 

Mark is single after a breakup right now and I’ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah’s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was “making eyes” at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We’re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.

I have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark’s house too and I won’t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn’t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn’t feel like a joke. I told her “if you seriously can’t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you’re not welcome here anymore. You’re 30, act like it. Get out.”

Hannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I’m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.

Update: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.

Update 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.

Final update: love who you love! Gay, straight, bi, pan, whatever, who cares? Love whoever you wanna love and enjoy your lives!!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs treatment?
content: My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.

It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.

She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. 

Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my group members they were horrors to work with?
content: I (21 F) am a college student who had a big project for one of my classes this semester and was paired with literally the worst group I have ever worked with. 

This project was to host an event and talk about a social issue important to us. I had two group members I'll call Ash and Ben. Ash came to class but would not talk even when asked a direct question. Ben would zoom into class occasionally and talked to Ash and me maybe 3 times all semester. Long story short; I ended up doing every single assignment for the project on my own because they wouldn't help even when directly asked. I emailed them when we had around a month left to set up a time and place for our event and was ignored. I sent a follow-up and it was ignored. I had to get the professor to message the entire group before Ash and Ben would answer my emails and that only lasted a day. I went through this process twice and before I knew it Ash and Ben weren't doing any part of their assigned roles and we had to present next class. 

I sent one final email reminding them of presenting (they didn't pay attention so didn't know) and with less than 20 hours until class they finally responded and the event was set up. The main holdback was honestly Ben because it was their job to send out email invites and set up the Zoom link. Since it was such little notice we weren't able to have many people join the event. One of the assignments we had to do for this project was to create an even agenda and these two geniuses didn't even realize we had one, so they were scrambling to make one minutes before the event started. I told them we had one and where to find it and was beyond pissed at this point. 

It didn't get better after the event either. The reflection assignment we had to do ended up being a group one, which both Ash and Ben claimed to have done. 4 days after the due date and neither of them had turned one in so I turned my own in. After that, I sent them an email saying they were horrible group members. I told them were disrespectful and I hoped they never treated another group like that again. 

Ben emailed back to trying to say he actually did everything and when I responded with proof he did not, he seemed to have let it be, until today. Today I had his version of the reflection shared with me where he only uses my name specifically to blame for every issue while cc'ing the professor. I can prove every he said wrong by just taking screenshots so idk what his angle is here. 

I guess I didn't *need* to send them a message so I could be an asshole for that but at the same time, this project put me through hell with stress. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my housemate to stop singing?
content: I(F15) live in this house with my parents(MF40s) who is renting it from a friend. We have this Chinese housemate (F28) who lives behind us with her mother(F64). Ever since we moved in, I hear her in her unit, when she comes near our wall, singing and doing weird noises like motorcycle sounds and pretending she's a siren. She would randomly make these sounds while doing stuff. She has a habit of singing in the shower. She would play old music from like 2005 or something and sing along. She's really into Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and musicals. But she tends to get too into it like she thinks she's Beyoncé or BLACKPINK. My parents are friends with her mother and they said she used to pursue singing but gave up because it's ""hard as an Asian"". Like no it isn't, look how popular KPop is. I think she's not trying hard enough nor is she good enough.

I tried being sympathetic and give her excuses but every day, she sings in the shower and she's making all these weird sounds. It's really bothering me and it makes me anxious on whether she'll stay quiet today or not. My parents told me to just put on headphones until she stops. But I shouldn't have to. Why do I have to do that when she's the one making noise? So I told her I need her to stop singing and making weird noises. I have anxiety and her making these noises are setting me off. She looked at me funny and said I needed to talk to my parents, not her. I stood my ground and told her that I have anxiety and she needs to accomodate me because I have a medical need. She slammed the door in my face. And later, my parents told me I was ""an asshole"" for bothering her.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my husband I’m upset that he missed work again because of his drinking
content: I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for 6 years and we have both always enjoyed drinking socially and just casually. The issue I have is that he misses work sometimes when he drinks, and when I express how I am upset with him about it he tells me how I drink too and it’s not like he misses work all the time. He used to miss work a LOT. But it has improved, but it is starting to happen more often again. 

I have not gotten upset with him for awhile over it because he gets sad and starts saying how he’s mad at himself too. But this is the second time he’s done this in the past month and I don’t want it to be a habit again. So AITA for getting upset?

EDIT: I believe I might be the asshole because I have missed work in the past because of drinking, but I corrected it because I don’t want that to be a habit I carry out. But I have still done it so maybe I’m being a hypocrite.

EDIT 2: Haven’t gotten the verdict yet but I’m going with ESH because I should also just stop drinking altogether. If I can slow down I can stop overall. I don’t want this to be the warning sign to stop that I ignored.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my husband he’s being a bad father?
content: I 30 female am married to my husband Jack 37 male for 3 years. We have a daughter together Hannah 3 and my step daughter Ashley (his daughter from a precious relationship) is 10. 

Hannah started dance classes this year. This is her first year performing at a recital and we were all very excited. We had tickets for all 3 shows (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) and couldn’t wait to watch her perform. 

Ashley found out earlier this week she’d be performing for her school chorus. The girl who originally was going to do it got sick. Ashley performance was Sunday at the same time as Hannah’s dance recital that night. 

Ashley told me how it would mean a lot to her if we went. So I worked it out with the dance school that Hannah would go the recital that night with my parents and Jack and I would go watch Ashley performance. (I would have pulled Hannah from dance but I was afraid she would want to sing during Ashley’s performance and Ashley should be able to have her own moment.)

When I told my husband he was so upset. He said he wanted to be there for all of Hannah’s performances and we shouldn’t be pawning her off on my parents. I said my parents were going to the show anyway and her bestfriends mom will help her with the costume (I helped her daughter the day prior). He said I was crazy if I thought sending our 3 year old without us was a good idea. She’s stayed with her grandparents and gone to do things with them before. 

I told him he was being stupid and that Ashley needed her dad too. He refused to go and went with Hannah and told me to meet him at the dance recital. I went to Ashley’s performance instead. While I was there I was saying hello to Ashley’s mother and ended up finding out Jack never answered her about if he could bring her new black shoes. Ashley didn’t realize until today the ones at her moms house were too small (doesn’t wear them often) and I didn’t want her to feel different from the other kids. Luckily I got there early and there’s a shoe store down the street so I went to buy some and told her mom to keep them there so she has a pair at both houses now. 

When I went home my husband and I got into a huge argument. He said I let down Hannah and she was sad. I told him to keep in mind she’s 3 she ALWAYS wants us and then forgets about it in 5 minutes when she sees something else she wants. I told him he needs to remember we have another child to also think about not just Hannah. I told him he was an awful father for not showing up for Ashley and for not even mentioning she needed shoes. Even if he wasn’t going the least he could do was bring her the shoes. Him and I are still arguing and he’s sleeping on the couch. He won’t even talk to me and honestly I don’t want to talk to him either. 

I feel like I might have crossed the line calling him a bad father. I was really angry. AITA?

Edit 1: 

I just realized I didn’t say why the shoes were mentioned. He asked me what that charge was for and when I told him he was mad I bought shoes for her mothers house. He said he pays enough in child support and buy her things for our house so it’s ridiculous.

Edit 2:

This morning Jack and I took the girls out for breakfast. During breakfast Jack was telling Ashley about Hannah dance recitals. Ashley wasn’t able to make the recitals because she had practice for chorus the other two nights. Ashley asked if that’s why he missed her singing and Jack said yes. Ashley said her mom recorded it and maybe we could all watch it together one night so he could see. Jack made a comment about her mother. I didn’t hear exactly what he said but by Ashley’s reaction and his face I could tell it wasn’t kind. Ashley then went to the bathroom and I told him to cut the comments and that it wasn’t necessary. I went to check on Ashley and she was crying. 

So I texted Jack and told him I was taking both the girls out for the day until he could figure out an apology to Ashley. I told him the same way he wouldn’t want someone talking about him or I to Hannah he shouldn’t be doing that to Ashley’s mother. He could either get therapy and apologize to his daughter or I’d be going to my parents when I get home after taking the girls out. 

When I got the girls in my car I called Ashley’s mom and picked her up. The 4 of us will be at the amusement park today. 

Jack has been texting me apologizing all morning. I’ve already told him I’m not the person he needs to apologize to.

Update: 

Ashley decided she wanted to stay at her moms house last night which I totally understood. Her mom also kept Hannah overnight for me so that Jack and I could talk about what happened with Ashley without either of the girls over hearing anything. 

I showed my husband this post and he cried reading through everyone’s responses. He’s opened his eyes to seeing that the favoritism is obvious to not only the girls but to everyone else. We talked about therapy and he’s agreed to go. We found a place that will actually do a family therapy where Jack, myself, and Ashley’s mom can have sessions together (Ashley’s mom also thinks it’s a great idea) and we can have the girls go as well but individually with just them and the therapist to talk. Blended families aren’t always easy to navigate and we want both the girls to also receive the benefits of having someone outside the family unit to confide in. 

This morning my husband decided he wanted to call Ashley to apologize. I told him it really should be done in person to seem genuine and he should call her first and be prepared if she’s not ready to talk to him yet and if she doesn’t want to accept his apology at this time. This way Ashley can decide when she’s ready to speak to someone who’s hurt her feelings. 

Once Ashley is out of school he will call her and see if she’d like to hear his apology. If she does and accepts his apology we’ll be watching her performance recording. Jack is also going to be apologizing to her mom for the comment that was made and ask if she’d like to do more family outings or dinners with us. He thinks it’ll be good for Ashley to also see them getting along which I think is a great idea.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my husband the nanny is in charge?
content: I want to preface this by saying that I am aware this is a very privileged issue but I’m trying to get some perspective on my opinion. 

My husband and I have 3 kids that are 10 months, 3 years and 6 years old. My husband has a high profile job and it means he’s gone often. I work a regular 9-5. We originally used daycare for our oldest but my middle was born right when the pandemic began, so we hired a nanny. She originally worked when I did. But by the time baby came around, I was very overwhelmed doing bath and bedtime on my own, on top of developing postpartum depression. After a breakdown, we spoke with the nanny and she agreed to adjust her hours so she’s helping me with dinner, bath and bed. 

We’ve gotten close over the past 6 months doing this. In many ways, she’s become like a third parent to the kids. She’s so good with them. We’ve created a routine that works well. I tend to the baby during bath and bed, she handles the older 2.  It’s a nice rhythm and my mental health has gotten so much better.

My husband isn’t traveling all the time but most nights, he isn’t even home for dinner and bed. He will help me weekends he’s home. But because he’s gone so often, he’s reluctant to be firm with the kids.

There are times he’s come home when our nanny is there. He tries to help her with bath and bed, but allows the boys to rough house, lets them break the routine and it seriously throws them off and delays bedtime.

My nanny shared with me she feels awkward. Obviously she doesn’t want to undermine her employer but it just makes her job harder. But my husband also doesn’t want her to go home when he arrives as he says he can’t handle it alone. 

I told him if that’s the case, then he needs to defer to the nanny and follow her lead. She knows our boys best and she has to deal with the aftermath when they don’t listen and give her a hard time.

My husband feels that she’s just an employee and he’s the dad. His salary does pay for her. However, I don’t feel this is fair to her.

I told him he either follows her lead for bed and bath or he doesn’t help at all. He told me I’m allowing the nanny to take over and replace him. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my husband to cut off his parents?
content: 
I (18F) am married to my husband (19m). We got married young because we had a baby when we were 17&18 and share a 1 year old son. When we found out I was pregnant, his family was so excited. They set up a baby shower for us during COVID even though nobody could go, just to make me feel special. 

A important part of the story is that my in laws do not speak great english, if any at all. There is very little communication between us, or it is translated between my husband. 

Other than that, my husband has a dog that currently lives at his parents. The dog was a family idea, but once my husband bought it, everyone decided they didnt want to help. He is called all hours of the night to let the dog go potty, even though they are 4 feet away from the dog and we do not live there. This was the starting point. After this he started running errands for them while he was visiting the house, including picking up McDonalds which he was asked to pay for. At this point I was mad and told him he was being used. He disagreed and said I was being disrespectful to his parents. 

I let it go for a while, but recently its just getting worse. He was sick and definitely needed to rest so he asked his parents to take the dog out. They were furious and cussed him out over the phone. He hung up and went to bed because he was so tired. I waited till he fell asleep and turned off his ringer so he could get some rest.

He woke up the next day with 20+ texts and missed calls from his parents telling him how horrible he is and irresponsible. He felt awful he slept through the messages and I told him to be glad he got to rest and not worry about it. 

This snowballed into them picking fights with him randomly and even complaining to his boss about him. That was the last straw for me. He was so upset and both of his parents were telling him how disrespectful he is to them. 

I bottle up how I feel because I know he is close with his mom, but I cant anymore. It is beyond what I thought it could be. My husband has been financially responsible for himself since he was 12. They dont help him in any way. 

I finally told him how I felt and that I was tired of being a babysitter for ignorant and rude people. I expressed that he is depressed and exhausted from this relationship and it needs to end. He got so mad that I would suggest that and told me I was being so disrespectful and its none of my business. I don’t think I am the asshole for suggesting it because clearly this relationship is toxic to us, but my husband will not cut them off no matter what they do. 

He is their grocery shopper, babysitter, chauffeur, he even pays some of their bills. They are extremely selfish, and I do not want to be around them anymore. 

Am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my husband we spend too much time with his parents?
content: Background:

We lived in SC for 3 years. Things were awesome. We made many friends and it felt like home.

Then, my husband wanted to move back to Montana. His mom said we can stay at her place to save to buy a house there. I did not want this, but my husband said he wanted to move back, and we could always visit SC.  I saw that he missed home and probably didn’t love SC as much as I did, so I compromised.

The issue:

We have been back in Montana at his parent's house for the past 9 months. When everyone is off work, I feel pressured to be “present” at dinner time. I don’t mind this occasionally – but every day is taking a toll on my mental.

Sometimes I just want to relax on my own/with him. However, his parents are automatically included in many plans. For instance: When I went on a trip to Denver, my husband texted me “I want to take you out for sushi, let’s do that when you get back :).” I got excited because I thought that meant a date night. But when I got back, it was all of us going out for sushi.

Yesterday:

He said, “Let’s go to church and then the movies afterward with my parents.” I said, “Can just the two of us have lunch?” and then he said, “Let’s go pick up Chipotle and take it home and then go to the movies \[with his parents\].” And then I said, “No I mean have a nice lunch, the weather is so nice! Let’s grab lunch outdoors – just us.” And then he said, “I’m not in an outdoors mood, I'm in a movies mood.”

Then I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. I didn’t want it to come out the wrong way and he cut me off and said, “Too late.”  And I said, “This is nothing against them – I want us to do our own thing.” He said, “You’re not about to cut out my quality time with my family.”

I grew angry because we LIVE with them, have dinner with them almost every day, and go on dates with them.

After we grabbed Chipotle to-go, I started bawling. I told him I can’t enter the house looking like this, I need to take a breather. But he pulled up in his parent’s driveway. As he was getting out of the car, I told him “Please don’t tell them - I don’t want them to take this the wrong way.” He asked, “You’re not coming inside?” and I'm like “Are you serious!? You really want me to come in looking like this!?” So, I left for my parent’s house to get some space. It’s been two days and he has not checked in. I feel like I offended him, but I don’t know how else I could’ve voiced my concern.

AITA for telling him we spend too much time with his parents?

TLDR: My husband and I moved to his parent’s home in Montana. After going on many double dates with his parents and having dinner after work with them almost every weeknight, I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. He got mad and said that I'm trying to cut down his quality family time. AITA for saying we spend too much time with them?",nta

Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her ""house"" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.


I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.


I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as ""punishment"" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.

My ex husband called me yelling about my ""pathetic attempt"" to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her ""future inlaws"". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my kids not to bother visiting if they insist on calling another woman mom
content: My ex and I have 2 kids together (12f and 10f). We separated when they were 6 months and 2 years old, divorced at 1 and 3, and he remarried when they were 3 and 5. I've never gotten along with his wife because she seems convinced that she's my kids' mom. It's only gotten worse since I remarried and moved. 

I tried to get primary custody of the kids when I moved but both of the kids asked to stay with their dad and their lawyer argued that they'd have to share a room with my stepkids and go to public school at my house while their dad has a house triple the size of mine where they'll have their own rooms and they'd go to a good private school so I ended up getting them every other weekend. 

Their stepmom used to contact me constantly about foods they like/don't like/are sensitive to, not wanting the kids to have to share their toys, keeping an eye out for teasing by my stepkids (nothing happened, my 10 yo is just sensitive), and using something like a night light/white noise machine at night. Every time I tell her to back off and I know what I'm doing with my own kids but she never listens. Then she started picking them up instead of their dad. I told her I wouldn't let the kids go with anyone but their dad and they actually took me to court over this and had my custody reduced to visitation at their house for almost 2 years. 

Now I have them every other weekend again and I started to realize they call their stepmom mommy/mama, they don't call me anything, and they only call my husband by his first name. I tried to correct them every time they called her mom but she'd give me a look and tell them it was okay and that they could call her whatever they want. 

I eventually told them not to bother visiting if they insist on calling another woman mom but won't even call me mom. They haven't visited or called in over a month. Part of me thinks they turned the kids against us and wants to go to court for parental alienation but part of me just wants to let go and focus on my new family. AITA for telling them not to bother visiting if they insist on calling another woman mom but not me?",yta
"title: AITA for telling my kids that I don't care if they dislike my husband but they have to respect him
content: Throwaway

I have three kids the youngest is 24 and the oldest is 29. There father died when they the youngest was a teenager. It was a rough time. I didn't date for the whole time they were in the house since I didn't want to bring people back that may not stay. Also, the kids really didn't like the idea of me moving on from dad.

Anyways they were at college I got back out there and started to date. I met Jim and he is a great guy, we dated for a while before I introduced him to the kids during one of the spring breaks. When my youngest graduated college I got married to Jim that same year. They were not happy and my oldest refused to come to the wedding since I was replacing their father. We got over that hill and they were happy I was happy.

Now they just can't deal with Jim at all, I get invited to a family event they get mad at me for bringing Jim. It's been rough even though he has never given them a reason to hate him, he is a polite guy that is kinda shy at times.

My oldest is getting married and I got an invite to the wedding. He called me up and told me that Jim can't come. I told him that he is my husband and we are a package deal. This got into an argument and all the kids jumped in, I told them I don't care if they dislike my husband but they have to respect him. That means he gets invites to family events.They called me an ass by the end of that

"title: AITA for telling my mom I need to be paid if I help with her new business?
content: For reference, my family moved to YS from S. Korea. My mom (52f) is thinking about opening up a new business with her coworker. Something about a golf wear? She doesn't speak English well and I'm assuming her coworker doesn't either, and she asked if I (27f) could help her out here and there.

The thing is, I'm in the process of job interviews at vet clinics. I have 5 interviews this week alone. Most vet clinics would want me to be full time and typical day would be anytime between 7 AM to 7 PM, 4 or 5 days a week. I'm not sure when my mom wants to start on her business, what their business hours would be, etc, and what exactly she would want me to help her with aside from translating. 

I told my mom I probably can't but if I did help out, I'd like to be paid. Or at least help me out with gas or groceries or buy me dinner. She got mad at me and said I don't care about her, she's supported me all this years, etc, and kept trying to guilt trip me into saying yes to free labor. One thing I hate about Asian cultures is that parents expect their kids to say yes to everything and not question it even if it's ridiculous. I calmly told her that I have my own life and she can take my offer or hire someone else to do the job, which would be far more expensive than what I'm expecting.

She's still upset that I'm not giving into her pressure. AITA?",yta

content: I (17 F- i apologise in advance to any typos you may find english is not my first language) live with my mom and my dad, my mom and I always had a rather rough relationship everything I gave her or made for her she would look at it,smile and thank me for me later find that in the trash or trwoed somewhere she would forget it. 

As a child I never payed to much attention to that for me it was normal that behavior.Until I reached 14 where I gave her a portrait that I decorated of me,her and my dad to later find that she replaced the original photo to one of her wedding.


Today (7th may), where I live is Mother's Day, and I thought of giving her something for both of us to do to try to rebuild our relationship since we didn't talk as much since my 14th anniversary, so I gave her a set from lego which u can build I gave her the bouquet since she loves flowers in what when she opened the present she had the same reaction she has whit every present I give her. 

Later today, I asked her if she was down to build that with me, and she looked at me, laughed, and told me, anda I quote, ""You bought to yourself, right? You just used mother's day as an excuse I know who I live whit"" I was shocked I looked her dead in the eyes and told her she will only receive a smile a gift or any other thing from me when she learned how to be grateful for the thinghs people give her .At one point, she was yelling at me telling me I was a brat on what my father came in and said the one being a brat was her and only her.


Note:it is not the first time, and unfortunately, it will not be the last that she does this to me or any other family member she didn't apologise but knowing how she is in a few days she is coming home whit something she bought to me as a gift and honestly I am tires of that.

"title: AITA for telling my mom not to tell me how to talk to my brother?
content: Me (23) and my brother (29) have been talking about getting an apartment together. I currently live with 2 roommates who are moving to different places so I will be on my own and he lives at home. The plan as discussed with both him and my parents would be that I moved home for a few months so we would not be looking to rent at peak prices then we would move out together. My mom was the one to offer me moving home, I did not ask for it.

 He has worked at the same chain store for 11 years, and his location is ~1 hour from where I work. When discussing our plans and options I mentioned that he could look into transferring if he wanted to. Currently he has no commute and he'd be looking at a ~30 min commute if we split the difference. I didn't tell him he has to I just suggested he thinks about it, but also that it was his choice and It didn't matter to me. 

When I spoke to my mother afterward also mentioning the commute, she said maybe we should live closer to him so he wouldn't have to drive so far (meaning I would have to drive further so he drove less). I said I'd like not to commute much more than 30min if possible since I already have to pay ~$8 in tolls a day. I mentioned to my mom what I said about my brother transferring and she said ""he doesn't want to do that. Don't mention it again. Don't bring it up."" In that harsh quiet mom tone. I was taken aback but moved on.

After driving home and thinking about it was was pretty upset so I texted her 

Me: I do not appreciate you trying to dictate what I can and cannot discuss with *brother. If we are going to be signing a lease together we need to be able to have adult conversations about all of our options. 

Mom: Moving back here might not be a good idea for you 

I feel like this was an unnecessary escalation and I'm confused about what I said warranting that. Now I'm looking for a place on my own cause I don't know what else to do, since I can no longer go home I need to find a place quickly and my brother isn't ready to move yet.

Was I in the wrong to bring that up with my brother, or say that to my mom? I really am confused.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom she’s a whore?
content: Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

“To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”

She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I’m not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",nta

"title: AITA for telling my mom she’s mentally abusive ?
content: Ok so, around a month or two ago me and my mom were in a fight she kept on telling me that I constantly made her feel like she was a bad mom and that she could be worse, and while yes I knew that she could be worse, she’s not a great mom either. She could be extremely manipulative, would constantly yell at me even though it wasn’t my fault, and just overall made me terrified of her. It didn’t make things any better when I was literally SAed and then she blamed me for it. I was already blaming myself as it was. But there have been multiple other incidents where she would make me feel like shit was my fault even though it wasn’t. So I had ended up saying that she wasn’t a good mom and she was really abusive sometimes. She had started crying and told me to leave her alone so I went up to my room, she didn’t say much to me about it but she hates it when I bring it up.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom that I need some space in my room cause I’m having intense period pain and need to sleep?
content: So me (24f) live with my family, we are Asian moving out isn’t a thing here.

We live in an apartment and we all have our separate rooms and yet my mom and my nephew who is 5 spend most of the time in my room which leaves me with no space of my own, normally I’m silent about it but sometimes its really really draining for my own mental health as I get no room to think of my own.

So yesterday I was feeling really sick due to my period and it was 11pm and told my mom that I just took some pain killer and will be headed to my room to sleep, she said okay. After 10 minutes my brother(39m) came into my room to feed my nephew, I told my mom that I’ll be sleeping so can you please tell him to feed my nephew in some other room, and she said no, let him feed him here they’ll go out quick, mind you that it usually takes 1 and a half hour to feel, I felt so angry and helpless that I went to a spare room and after they left I told mom that I was feeling really sick n I just needed to sleep, she lashed out at me and told that you should seal your room if you are so bothered by people in your room. 

Since then today my mom isn’t talking to me much and not coming to my room at all and avoiding it at all cost, which is kind of making me guilty that if I overreacted?

So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom to stop asking for my friend’s and boyfriend’s numbers?
content: I (23f) still live with my parents and here lately they have really been in my business. Ever since me and my boyfriend got through our little break and have hung out more, my mom (51f) has been on me more about giving her my boyfriend and best friend’s cell phone numbers since I hang out with them frequently. Whenever I question her about it, she goes into this whole guilt trip about how there could be some emergency and she may not be able to reach me so she’d have to call whoever I’m with. Well, that went on and I caved and gave her my boyfriend’s number. She kept it in her notes app and said she’d only use it if she had to. 

Fast forward to three days ago, I’m at work. For clarification, I sometimes substitute at the daycare my mom works at, so we’re both there. She walks by and as I’m trying to wrangle the kids into a line, she comes up and says “you never gave me your friend’s phone number”. 

I’m already upset because of the kids, so I turn around and say “why do you need it so badly?” And she goes into the whole guilt trip thing I stated previously. That’s when I told her I have my phone on me all the time, she will be able to reach me when she needs me. I told her she’s treating me like a kid here recently and I’m almost 24, so she doesn’t need my friend’s or boyfriend’s phone numbers. Then she says I’m still her kid no matter how old I get. I said I get that, but she needs to back off and just let me live.

So I’m wondering if I’m the asshole in this situation, or are my actions justified?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom to “get a job”?
content: Due to some reasons, my mother lost her job. Right before Covid, she was hired into another job but soon lost it due to the pandemic. It has been 3 years now and she does not have a job. I have never mentioned it as I do not have a place to say anything. I am so grateful for my mother as she provides me so much love, but at times she tends to be very negative. When I was younger, my parents tended to talk about their financial issues in front of me. I remember this one time when I was around six, they were talking about being tight on money. Little me thought that we would become homeless and live on the streets. I remember being on the couch scared for hours. Fast forward to now, I am older but not old enough to provide for myself. We have been tight on money due to rising electrical bills and only my father working. My father has been asking my mother to get a job for a while now. The thing is, she does not even try to. Usually I just stay back and don’t say anything but today was different. My mother started to talk about using less water since the bills doubled. Of course I understood. Earlier I mentioned how my parents talked about money in front of younger me. I think this might have caused some sort of fear when it came to “being tight on money” because six year old me took this as living on the streets (if that makes sense). I asked my mother “are we really broke?” and she said yes. So then I asked “then we are poor?” Which she responded with yes again. This made me really anxious but luckily my brother reassured me by saying we are not rich, but definitely not poor. My mother on the other hand disagreed and said we are. This somehow resulted in an argument. I honestly do not remember 100% what caused me to say “then can you get a job?” To her. I think it might have been the fact that her saying we are poor reminded of six year old me being scared on the couch in the fear of losing a home and food. I know I should have been more careful with my words, but I just really wish that she tried a little harder to find a job. My father told me how she does not try to find a job at all even after the amount of times he has asked her. She relied on me emotionally a lot and would tell me how she does not know if she can still do her job just as well as before. The thing is, how can she know if she doesn’t try? Anyways, after I told her “can you find a job?” She got upset. I understand why and would have apologized but then she said that the way I talked just now was ghetto and that I’m a low class kid below everyone. So then I asked “do you know what ghetto means?”. In response she said that it means me. Keep in mind my mother calls anything she finds unpleasant ghetto. She went off on me which hurt. After when my father came home, my mother blew everything out of proportion which wasn’t unusual. I told him my side of the story but per usual he doesn’t care. Am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom we haven’t had a good relationship in a long time and I wanted to go live with my dad?
content: I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother. That has since crashed and burned since she dated and married my stepdad “Gary” six years ago. Gary treats his son “Ian” (19M) like he’s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to “make the transition easier for everyone.” Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn’t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn’t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn’t affect me at all.

My dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He’s home now and he’s offering to have me come live with him. I’m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I’d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn’t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven’t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary’s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because ”I wasn’t family” so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn’t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. 

She’s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I’m being.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I’m treating them and how I’m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I’m the asshole for “making things hard” for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back.

I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

"title: AITA for telling my mother I want to break generational curses and speaking to her ‘without compassion’ infront of my husband.
content: I (29F) grew up with an impulsive mother (father in and out of picture, out for most part. Her impulsiveness and lack of understanding regarding money is a sore point for me, we had financial lows because of her choices. She ruined one of my brothers credit and made my other one take out an overdraft).

She knows it is a sore point for me, she decided while owing money to open a store just after the pandemic and after already having no savings, being close to retirement and a previously opened store that failed and I had to watch her cry and the bailiffs come in.  We begged her not to open and save the money but no one can tell her anything. This is one of many bad memories regarding money. 
I recently got married, she called me and said there’s a property for sale I should invest in, I politely said no, she had asked why - I said me and hubby have our own plans on investment. She insisted the house was a good investment, it wasn’t. The potential rental income wouldn’t pay the mortgage. I politely said no again, and she kept on asking me why, getting louder and louder with each ‘why’.  I told her that even my husband agrees it is a bad investment (he was in earshot). She continued insisting, and I said “Mum, I would really like to break certain generational curses and I definitely want to change our families relationship with money. She went silent then said “WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU NEVER WENT HUNGRY, YOU ALWAYS HAD A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD”… We did, go hungry a few times but I left that out and just replied reminding her we spent a good portion of our time through out the years as kids, teenagers and young adults hiding from bailiffs when they knocked at the door and I don’t want to relive that. She said that that is normal and a part of life. I said “no mum, it isn’t”. And she just said “Ok”, I tried to comfort her as I saw she was upset and she just kept replying with a bunch of sarcastic “Ok’s”.

"title: AITA for telling my mother her behavior was disgusting?
content: I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong for telling my parents that their actions are hurtful. They've always been my rocks, even when I went through a tough breakup with my ex, Kevin, who didn't value me and made cruel comments about my appearance. I went to college in Maine and called my parents every day, but I also met someone special named Adam, who was a 45-year-old professor. We loved each other, but I ended up spending every Thanksgiving with Adam's family, which meant missing out on spending those holidays with my own family. I was always respectful and called to let them know I couldn't make it, but eventually, my parents stopped calling me altogether.

The other day, I happened to scroll through my mom's Instagram and saw a photo of her and my ex, Kevin, with the caption ""my fake son is the best."" This made me feel hurt and disrespected, especially given Kevin's past behavior towards me. When I reached out to my mom via a DM to express my feelings, she replied dismissively, saying that since I don't visit anyway, I shouldn't be bothered and should just spend time with my new family. 

My husband disagrees with my parents' behavior and thinks they're being bad people for associating themselves with my ex. However, some of my friends are telling me to just let it go since I don't see my parents often anyway. Despite this, I feel that it's reasonable to expect my family to be sensitive and respectful of my past experiences.",info
"title: AITA for telling my mother to stop commenting on my looks, whatever the comments imply?
content: I (25F) have a long history of dealing with bullying targeting my looks that dates back to my early teenage years. I've had people call me ""seagull poop"", ""toilet face"", ""tumor"", ""nature's mistake"" and more. They even started involving other people in an actual taunting contest. Eventually I became the joke of the entire town. 

My life wasn't easier in other settings. Strangers stopped me on the street just to insult my appearance, older boys in school tortured me and even my female friends hinted at how they could get guys while it wasn't an option for me. At home, my mom aggressively pointed out every flaw she saw in my face and body, then pulling the ""I only say it to make you work on yourself"" card on me to justify the most hurtful words. 

All of this went on for years. Miraculously, in my late teens my looks somehow ""stabilized"" and the bullying subsided. I partially regained control over my life and was finally given the chance to make more positive memories. I started engaging in dating and better friendships, exploring my identity and the world outside.

Nonetheless, the constant dehumanization I was put through took a huge toll on my mental health. Still as of today my body image is extremely negative, to the point I can't even look at pictures of me. I am very easily triggered by any circumstance that reminds me of those times (e.g. when I walk by a group of male teenagers on the street my heart starts pounding and I instantly hide my face because I expect to hear insults at any moment). Most aspects of my life, including my studies and career, have been heavily impacted by my paralyzing anxiety for negative judgement and intense fear of other people. Not even having validating friendships, people finding me attractive and a loving long-term partner seem to help me fight the feeling of being a renegade. 

As for my mom, over the years I have fought for and managed to obtain a gentler appearance-related discourse on her side, but still she doesn't seem to understand how insanely hard my life is and my desire to avoid constant comments. 

Last night, as everytime I see her again, she started scanning my body and she told me I look more toned now that I started swimming. I snapped and told her ""You REALLY can't help it, you always HAVE to observe my body and remind me of how different it should be"". She said she just wanted to cheer me for the ""results"" I am getting from swimming. I told her all I want is to be left alone and I don't care about any unprompted comment, whether intended as positive or negative, as I am trying very hard to build a life where my looks are finally not the biggest deal for me and the biggest focus for everybody else. She started crying and told me that she feels like I am stuck in the past and she really can't say anything to me. 

I was very enraged, but now I kinda feel bad. AITA for wanting to be blessed with body neutrality and not welcoming compliments that still imply that the ""before"" was not good enough?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mum she couldn’t wear white to my wedding?
content: I got married recently, my mum basically wanted to make the day just as much about her as possible.  Honestly, I lost count of the number of times I heard “well I am the mother of the bride!” She kept moaning that the mother of the bride doesn’t have a role in the wedding. 

Leading up to the wedding she told me she was going shopping for a mother of the bride dress and she sent me a picture of a floor length ivory, lacy dress that she wanted to buy for the wedding.  I text her back saying it looked like a wedding dress and that she couldn’t wear it (my wedding dress was ivory). She got very defensive saying that she “is the mother of the bride” she needed to stand out too. I told her yes the mother of the bride is important but she can’t wear white. I explained what I thought was a well known rule that no one except the bride (and the flower girls) could should wear white to a wedding. 

In the end I text my dad for help who also involved mums close friend. They went shopping with her and when she showed them the dress she liked they both said “ you can’t wear that! It’s basically a wedding dress”.  She told them she had never heard of the unwritten rule about not wearing white to someone’s wedding, and that she wanted to stand out too. 

She was not happy with me for speaking to my dad behind her back and grudgingly picked a different dress. But she feels that I was being a bridezilla for dictating what she wears. 

So AITA for telling her not to wear white/ivory to my wedding?


EDIT. Thank you all for the comments, it seems the majority think I am NTA.  But to answer a few questions:
Yes she did have a role in the wedding, she signed the witness book, walked down the aisle first with the flower girls as they were young and scared to go down alone. I said she could do a speech as well if she wanted but she declined.  There were other things too. 

Yes the wedding is over and she didn’t end up wearing a white or ivory dress, her dress was white with red flowers with a bright red hat and I just decided to pick my battles. 

Finally for the person who said that I am dragging this up after the wedding is over and IATA for not letting it go, she keeps bringing it up saying I was a bridezilla for not letting her choose her outfit and that I wanted all the attention on me.  It had me doubting myself as my sister also agreed with her. None of my other friends and family thing I was a bridezilla and all said they had a smashing time at the wedding.  The day was about my husband and I, I do not crave the spotlight at all. My primary concern was what people would say about her and too her on the day.",info
"title: AITA for telling my nephew he can move in with me when he's older?
content: Nephew is currently 8 years old. He is living in a very toxic household right now and I am his comfort person. My sister is his mom. He's the only child from her current marriage. She was married before and has my 15 year old nephew and 13 year old niece. Her husband was also married before and has two boys and two girls who are also teens. The dynamic with the two ex's is very toxic. My nephew has been caught up in it in every possible way. The two ex's have said cruel things to his face (calling him disability slurs, saying he's worthless, he should never have been born, etc). The thing that makes this even worse, not that I think there is ever an excuse, is he was not born as the result of an affair. Both my sister and her husband were divorced. These ex's simply don't like that fact. None of his half siblings like him and all of them have been mean to him and have crossed into bullying him over the years. His parents tell him they don't mean it and they're just hurting and expect my nephew to process all this without issue. They have not put him in therapy, have not sat down to talk to him about stuff and when he talks to them, he feels dismissed and like they don't care.

I have attempted to speak to both my sister and her husband. No dice. I'm just the uncle. I don't see everything is the vibe they give off when I try to communicate these concerns to them.

My big reason for not pushing this more for my nephew is a fear I will be cut out of his life if I annoy my sister and her husband too much.

So instead of trying to get my sister and her husband to make things easier for him I have just decided to be the uncle he needs. He can talk to me, come to my house, I will take him out and I do everything to make sure he feels loved and wanted, like he's not a mistake, that not everyone hates him, that he has someone in his corner. A few times he has asked if he could live with me and he can't. So I have told him maybe one day. But he was very upset a couple of weeks ago. It was my mom's birthday and everyone was there. He'd been called names by his older siblings and his parents were more focused on the older kids than him. He said nobody wanted him, not even me really. I told him I can't just take him to live with me since he's a kid and his parents have say over that. But I told him when he's older he can move in with me, when he's legally old enough to choose, and that I will still always be here for him.

My sister overheard and went crazy. She told me I had no right to try and take her son off of him. She and the rest of her family left, including my nephew. She told me to go fuck myself. Her husband was also furious at me and said nephew is not my kid and that I should never say shit like that.

"title: AITA for telling my new co worker it was misleading of him to be wearing his wedding band when he's a widower?
content: 

Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named ""James"" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break.


We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).
James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.

For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.
I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.


AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?

This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my niece to stay in the closet until she gets her inheritance?
content: My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian.  I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.

However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.

My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.

Since both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.

She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.

My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.

I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.

Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?

**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.  She is a powerful advocate of LGBTQ+ rights so she had an angry knee-jerk reaction to my dad's bigotry.**",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents I don't want to work for them after college?
content: The other day, my (18F) parents sat me and my brother down to talk some things about our family business. For the past three years, we've writen fiction books as a family (my dad writes the books; we help do social media content, promotion and other stuff like emails to illustrators and whatnot; and it goes under a female pen name my mom is the face of) and sell them online. My parents are really passionate about making this a successful, multi-million dollar company and I am happy to support them because it will help us all as a family.

It's not their main job--my mom works and my dad is retired but they work very hard in it, but I admit we are struggling and haven't made much money but we're not giving up.

Back to the conversation, along the way my parents asked me if I saw myself working for the business once I graduate college, so like 22. (By the way it id a close by college so I still will be living at home.) I just graduated high school and I think I should keep helping now, but I think after college I would like to do other things. Seems the right time for it.

I told them that and they got very disappointed. They said they were really hurt by my response and not being supportive enough especially when I know they're struggling and they need all the encouragement they can get. And that I should at least help out a little bit, or part-time even after I graduate, as I can still help them (and thus, the family) while I do my own thing.

On one hand I can see what they mean, but on the other, I didn't mean to hurt them at all with my answer. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents I won’t go on vacation with them if they don’t make a decision on their own?
content: Some background, my (f 22) parents separated when I was 13. I’m gonna refer to my parents as “Ryan”(53 m) and “Tom” (55 m)to make it easier to follow. My dads’ breakup was messy and there’s still a lot of animosity between them. Idk all the details because I was young when it happened and honestly I don’t want to know because I love them both and I don’t want my opinions to change on them. Neither of them say anything bad about one another to me but they definitely don’t get along. 

Onto the issue. Both of them have good jobs and we’ve always gone on really fun family vacations at the end of summer. Since they split, they each have continued to do those vacations and allowed me to choose which one I would go on. At first I just switched back and forth but the past few years it’s almost become a competition. A few years ago Ryan chose to go to Hawaii and Tom chose London but once I decided on Hawaii Tom changed it to Tokyo because he knew I wanted to go there. This year Ryan chose Paris because I’ve been obsessed since I was a kid and Tom chose Italy because visiting the colosseum is on my bucket list. I’m sick of being the one that has to choose and I always feel so bad for the person I don’t choose to go on a family vacation with. 

I talked to each of them one on one and basically said that I won’t be going on any family vacations ever again until they can figure it out on their own. The competition makes it so stressful for me and I spend most of the vacation texting the other one because I feel bad. Tom told me he understood but Ryan told me that it’s really hurting him that I won’t go on any vacations ever again. I told him that I would go again once they worked it out and he said “you know that’s never going to happen. We can’t work anything out” Idk what to do. Am I being mean? I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings and ik that I probably sound so spoiled but AITA?

"title: AITA for telling my parents that I'm not the ""black sheep"" of the family?
content: I (20m) finished second year of college, and I have a sister (16f) who finished 11th grade and a brother (26m). My brother has a prestigious high paying software job, and lives a great life. He did well in college and got a bachelor and master degree in computer science. And my sister is actively involved in a bunch of clubs at school, got gymnastics and piano awards, does well academically, and is going to work at a restaurant over the summer. But I struggled last year, and my GPA dropped from like 3.8 to 3.6. My major is architecture and it's just that the studios are so long and hard, plus I had a tough time in physics. I didn't get any summer internships, so I'm taking summer classes.

This summer I'll be commuting to school 3 days a week, so that requires gas, parking, and insurance, which my parents helped pay for. But it costs a good deal of money, so they aren't too happy about it. Also, because of my classes I won't be able to help around much at home with chores, other family members will have to do more chores inevitably. My parents already talk about that themselves, and when I overhear their conversation they talk about how I'm a burden who does nothing useful.

Earlier today my parents were saying how I should be like my brother who excelled in college and makes 6 figures. I said that I'm trying my hardest, and that some classes like physics or certain architecture courses are very difficult. Often I spend entire days in studio and thus didn't really have a social life. They pointed out that my sister is very social and still does well academically, and even got a summer job. I felt really bad and told them that internships are hard to come by and that recruiters prefer 3rd years and up over 1st and 2nd years. Then my dad said that my brother got internships starting his second year, because he is smarter and more hard working than me. That made me really mad so I said that I do work very hard, and that intelligence is partially genetic. Both my parents got mad at me, and told me to be more like my siblings. I couldn't contain it any more so I screamed that I am not the black sheep of the family, and that they need to stop treating me as such. I told them I don't appreciate being called a burden, and that everyone goes at their own pace. However my mom said that I asked to be treated like this because I didn't work hard enough in school (which I did, despite being in a brutal major).

I stopped talking to my parents after this incident (about 2 hours ago), and I just isolated myself to my room crying.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents they were bad parents to me?
content: I (19M) have an autistic brother (20M). He’s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he’s got my parents convinced he just doesn’t understand what he’s doing, and they don’t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he’s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.

The problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I’m sorry that they feel that way, but I’m still going. Well here’s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn’t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they’d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.

I got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn’t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I’d just not live my life because of him?

She started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I’m refusing. My grandpa said he’s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don’t think I need to give them one. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents to stop hooking me up with single girls from their church? AITA for not wanting to get married?
content: The last year and a half has been hard for me, to say the least.

Last March, my brilliant and hilarious and beautiful girlfriend Natalie suddenly passed away.  Everyone always gave shit about us because of politics.  We met in college when were were poly sci majors: she is very liberal (think AOC) and I'm pretty conservative.  We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  

Well, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were ""drift compatible"".  

I wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.

My parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.

No offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. 

My parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  

But when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  

They are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.  But like I said, Natalie was my soulmate and I just can't see myself being with anyone else but her.  Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.

Edit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.  But around the time she died, it was more like how funny it would be if the bridal party wore blue and the groomsmen wore red because the bride is a Democrat and the groom is a Republican/Romeo and Juliet deal.

Fuck, I wish we got to do that.  Natalie thought it was hilarious.

Edit of the edit:  Sweet Disney's ghost!  I am ashamed to admit this, but I broke down when I saw all of your responses.  Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all great and wonderful people and God will reward you for your kindness.  Your support is overwhelming.  I haven't felt this supported in a very, very long time.  

I am reading all of your comments.  Thank you, thank you so much.  I've been feeling so lost for a long time, and with the virus it has been sending me into a tailspin.  I am saving this post so when I feel dark, I can come here and read your comments and I know that even though we are strangers, we have each others backs.  

And in this day and age, we need it even more than ever.  God bless you all!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my pregnant gf to stop talking about her deceased cousin
content: My (29M) girlfriend Tiffany (32F) is six months pregnant with our first baby. A couple of weeks ago her cousin passed away unexpectedly. Tiffany’s aunt and cousin will be coming from overseas to collect his body and will be staying with my girlfriend. (We don’t live together yet but will do before the baby arrives). 

Last night I was out to dinner with my girlfriend who was saying she doesn’t know how long her aunt and cousin will be staying with her and it’s stressing her out a little bit as we’ll be moving, she’s working a lot and she’s pregnant (low risk, she’s had a good pregnancy so far).

Now I was working all day and haven’t had a day off in 14 days. I’m physically and mentally drained. I asked my girlfriend to pause on speaking about the situation with her cousin and family and to focus on more positive things such as the fact we’ll be having a beautiful baby and we’ve finally found a place to live after a long search. 

My girlfriend asked why she’s not allowed to talk about negative things. I said she can but that we also have a lot of good things going on at the moment and we don’t need to keep speaking about her family. She said she’d only been discussing it for 5 minutes and she was done anyway, she just wanted to share how she was feeling since I’d asked. She then got up from the dinner table and left the restaurant. She had a hospital appointment to check for gestational diabetes this morning and apart from me checking that her appointment went fine, we haven’t spoken since.

"title: AITA for telling my roommate she was being rude when she asked guests to clean up at her party?
content: I (F, 27) am a current second year medical student, living in a house with 2 classmates. One of them, let’s call her Ali (F,27),  I lived with last year in this house with a different third roommate. My/Our friend is the current third roommate, let’s call her Bea (F,28).

Throughout the school year we would have little random get togethers, and the pattern would always be that Ali would host and invite, leave a big mess, then literally leave for a camping trip and Bea and I would have to clean up together. If Bea and I hosted, we would always clean up after ourselves and our guests.

This year, Ali wanted to host again. Bea and I said okay to having people over but made it clear that we would not be part of the hosting, meaning we would not be doing the bulk of the cleaning. As the night was winding down (around 1am), Ali decides that she is leaving at 7am the next morning with her boyfriend to go on a trip. She asks if Bea and I will help with some cleaning since she won’t be able to. We agree to helping with SOME cleaning but still said this is your party and we’re not going to do all of it.

A proceeds to go back to the bonfire. Afterwards, Ali tells the guests that she’s tired, is going to bed and asks if they can clean up and put the fire out. This is about 20 drunken medical students, at someone else’s house, who are being asked to clean up and bring things into a house they have never been in. 

Ali leaves, showers, and goes to bed without once checking on our guests who are literally cleaning up everything outside. Meanwhile, Bea notices that the guests are stumbling around outside and rushes downstairs to help.

Next morning, Ali leaves at 7am. When I went downstairs, it smelled disgusting; trash, dirt, and leaves everywhere in the house. It almost looked how it did the night before.

Generally, I believe that the host should clean up after her guests, and be the last one up to say goodbye and make sure everything is okay. I’m not opposed to having people help out, but as host I feel it is rude to ask that of them and then leave.

I texted Ali the next morning about how the house was left and that I felt it was rude that she asked the guests to clean up and put out the fire.  She called me in a huff, saying that “YOU agreed clean” and I said yes, I would help, but you’ve left us with literally everything. She then said that she spoke to Bea and that Bea had agreed to clean. I reiterated that I said we don’t mind HELPING but that this was not the first time she has done this. She had said when she went down in the morning everything was brought inside—and I was like yes, by Bea and everyone else, not you. 

She continued to send defensive statements that still did not address the fact that she left her own party and instead called me rude for “blaming her unfairly”.  My friends and I all agree but in this regard, AITA?",nta

Last week, my roommate’s cousin (19f) came to stay at our place. We agreed to her staying 4 days. We are on day 6. The dynamic immediately changed when she arrived. Her cousin, who we will call Beth, is a self-proclaimed sex addict and alcoholic. She is incredibly rude. She refuses to pay for any food that she eats in our apartment because “it is rude to make your guests pay”. She leaves a mess everywhere she goes. She keeps shutting our AC off even though it’s humid and we live in Arkansas. Beth also has drunk all of the alcohol in our apartment without asking. 

All of those things I can take. Last night, however, was different. My roommate, Beth, myself, and our friends Mel and Zaya were hanging out. Zaya’s parents just split up and she was really upset about it. Beth took it upon herself to constantly remind Zaya that her parents are getting divorced to the point where Zaya was inconsolably crying. I told Beth to shut up, and she threw a drink in my face. Beth later told my roommate that she has been doing this on purpose to drive a wedge between all of us. She said it like it was a fun little game. 

My roommate and I got in our first real fight that night. My roommate has even been complaining about how awful it has been to have Beth here. I told her that if Beth is not gone by 5 pm tomorrow, then I was leaving. My roommate got extremely mad at me because it is her family and I shouldn’t be putting her in that position.

content: My roommate  (24f) is a big Game of Thrones fan. She’s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, ‘Arya’. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.

The next day, which was yesterday, she said she’s found a way to name her baby ‘Arya’ and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. 

She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name.

content:  

Hi everyone,

I'm currently living with a roommate who loves to blast loud music at all hours of the day and night. It's been an ongoing issue for us, and I recently decided to confront them about it.

However, the situation quickly turned sour when they pointed out that I sometimes play loud music too. They accused me of being hypocritical and unfair for expecting them to stop while I don't always follow the same rule.

I understand their point, and I admit that I can be guilty of playing music loudly at times. But I feel like there's a difference between occasionally forgetting to turn down the volume and intentionally blasting music non-stop for hours on end.

I also pointed out that I'm usually receptive when they ask me to turn down the volume, whereas they always refuse to do the same for me. But they still insist that I'm being hypocritical and that we should both be held to the same standard.

content: I'm a 19 year old man with a 3mo old son. His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.

The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.

I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?

ETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again.",info
"title: AITA for telling my sister I wont baptise their 2 Year Old?
content: Am I The Asshole for telling my sister i wont baptise her kid after i found out what she really thinks about me? 

To tell this story, you'll need a little context. 

I am a mid - to late twenties male, have two siblings, but for the purposes of this story, you'll only need one, my older sister. Early 30s. Married with two kids

I was living with my fiance, and our roommate was in the process of moving out of our apartment, so we were looking forward to having our whole apartment to ourselves, as we were planning to conceive a child and get married.

I got a call from my mom, who informed me that my father and herself had made the decision to separate. My mother asked my fiance and I to move into the family home to help financially because she would not be able to afford the house on her own. I said okay, and my fiance and I made plans to move in. 

During the process of prepping a space for my fiance and I, my mom found my father's old IPad from a failed business venture, which was still logged into his Facebook. On his Facebook messenger, my mom began to read OUTLOUD (remember this for later) what my sister and himself were saying about ME and her

Essentially, they had dragged myself and my mom through the mud. Saying ""the only reason he is moving in is for free babysitting for their kid"" or ""he has middle child syndrome"" and ""he takes advantage and manipulates everyone around him.""

Now, to clarify, I've always had a rocky relationship with my dad, so the behavior from him wasn't out of character. However, with my sister, although we had a tough time getting along as kids, after we had grown up and started our own lives, I was under the impression that we had grown closer. And could even be described as friends.

But having to hear and then read all these nasty horrible things she was saying about ME to my father broke my heart. 

I stopped talking to her after that. 

Mom and dad got back together after a death in the family. 

Which caused my fiance and I to have to live at the family home un the dark unfinished basment for awhile which was difficult.

During our stay I had it out with my sister. Because she was always over at the family home making my mom and younger siblings babysit her kids (Ironic Right?) She told me that the messages were private and that since I was never supposed to see them, I should forget about them.

She said she was sorry that I saw them but not sorry for writing them.

I saved face and pretended that I forgave her  but still haven't spoken to her much.

My fiance and I moved out as quickly as we could to get away from all this.

My sister recently started asking while I was visiting my mom if I could baptise her 2 year old. 

I told her no. I'm not interested in having anything to do with her family after finding out the things she thinks of me. 

Am I the Asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister her jealousy and over the top reactions to me are why I don't want to do joint stuff with our kids?
content: My sister and I are a year apart in age. She's 27 and I'm 26. Growing up we weren't exactly close but we were okay. We have a cousin Beth who is 27. My sister always saw her as a potential BFF and always wanted to hang out with her, but she was way too intense for Beth and was kinda stalkery around Beth. For example she requested a change in class schedule every year of high school a week in so they'd be in all the same classes, she wanted to join every extra curricular Beth did, if Beth was over at our house she'd make up a reason for our parents to let her walk Beth home, even when Beth didn't want to walk with her, she'd wait for her at her locker in school just to speak to her, she asked our parents to take her to a soft play area when she was younger because Beth was going to a party there. Stuff like that was constant. To make things worse Beth and I got along really well. My sister used to hate it and would insert herself into everything and attempt to push me out. More recently she invited Beth to be there when she had my nephew.

Now my sister and I have babies 4 days apart in age. My sister and I chose names that are very different stylistically for our kids. She went with George for her son. My daughter is Lyric. I don't do a lot of social media but I do have an Instagram and Beth commented on the post where I announced my daughter's name saying how much she loved it, etc.

Then a few weeks later we were all at our grandparents and Beth brought up my daughter's name and how she thought it fit her perfectly and was cute. My sister was so jealous. When my partner and I were leaving she asked me why the hell Beth liked my daughter's name so much and how come she never gushed about George the same was she did Lyric. She said she assumed that an Elizabeth who went by Beth would appreciate a strong, classic, royal name. I told her it was nothing to do with me. She told me I must have asked Beth what kind of names she liked when I was pregnant and that's why she was so in love with my daughter's name. She told me I always hogged Beth and that my daughter has a dumb name and she'll hate me.

I could feel the jealousy rolling off her even without her saying that. But it made me realize how we need to keep our distance and I don't want my daughter subjected to that. Now my sister is suggesting that we do joint stuff with the kids. So like birthday parties and Easter parties and stuff. I was like no way are we doing that. She was saying it was perfect and I was being selfish and denying the cousins the chance to be close. I told her her jealousy and over the top reactions to it are why we're not doing joint stuff and that she is not going to get the chance to treat my daughter the way she treats me and is not going to ruin my daughter's special celebrations just because she's jealous that I get along with Beth.

My sister said I was being unfair, bullying her and punishing her for feeling left out which ""makes me an even bigger bitch"". AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister no one cares who she dates?
content: My brother was seeing a girl from outside our culture for a few months, and no one liked that he was doing that. We were all relieved when they broke up and he started seeing someone else. My sister started seeing someone from outside our culture too, but no one really cares. She kept trying to bait our parents into saying something, but they just told her to do what makes her happy. Eventually she broke up with this guy.

She said we are the reason she broke up with him, because she knew we would never accept him, just like we didn't accept our brother's girlfriend. I told her she's silly. No one cares who she dates. Only women count for passing on our culture, so she can have kids with anyone, and it won't make a difference. She just wants drama, but no one cares.

She said I'm an asshole, but I don't see how. She wants us to disapprove, but why should we? She's a woman. If she has kids they'll be members of our culture regardless, and if she doesn't have kids it matters even less. If anyone has a reason to feel put out it is our brother, but what does she have to complain about? Am I the asshole for pointing this out?",yta
"title: AITA for telling my sister she needs to let go of the fact she didn't get her picture perfect pregnancy announcement and help her kids?
content: My sister has two kids. An 11 year old girl and a 10 year old boy. Their father and my sister were married, unhappily, before he died. Both were amazing parents who loved their kids. They did not work as a couple. Both were so young when they started dating and then she got pregnant and they fought to try and make a family work for the kids but it only made them hate each other over time. Then he died and my niblings were heartbroken. At 5 and 6 they were young but he was one of their two favorite people.

My sister has remarried since, about a year ago and she recently learned she was pregnant. She had this big photo perfect announcement planned with her, her husband and the kids, to show their excitement for the new baby arriving and the growing of their blended family. Except my niblings are not excited and this was not a happy thing for them. They told my sister they didn't want to be part of her announcement and when she asked why, they said they kind of hate that she is pregnant with someone else's baby and they don't want to be a blended family. She was heartbroken. She questioned them on why and they said her husband is just her husband and not their dad and this baby ""isn't dad's"" and how they wouldn't have chosen for a baby to come along.

It's been weeks now and my sister is mourning the announcement she planned and I think she is holding onto some negative feelings toward the kids. I think she dropped the ball a lot on this because clearly she never asked her kids how they felt about her husband or about the changes that had come into their lives. She just assumed they were happy and now her bubble has burst.

The kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. This is when I knew I needed to speak to my sister. She told me how much of a shock it was for her kids to say they weren't excited and didn't want the family they have. She also told me how much it broke her heart that they didn't do the announcement for her and now she won't be able to show the baby this exciting, loving announcement they get older, won't be able to show how the whole family was excited for their arrival. I told her she needs to let go of the fact she won't get her announcement as she wanted it. That she has two kids who need her and she needs to help them through this because they think everyone would be better off if they lived with me and that is not good for them to feel that way. She told me I was being unfair to her and piling on about something she's upset about. I told her she always told me being mom came first, her kids needs came first and that meant sometimes adults had to deal with their own shit quickly. I told her that was what her kids needed right now.

She still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked. She is still not happy with me though. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister she needs to seek therapy to help her through her struggles?
content: My sister suffered a very bad miscarriage last year. This was not her first but it was the miscarriage that put her in the hospital for two weeks and left her unable to be pregnant again. She has always longed to be a mother and now she knows she can never give birth to her own biological child. It has been a lot for her.

Along with that she has been a stepmom for 8 years to 17 and 16 year old girls and a 14 year old boy. She loves those kids fiercely, and has grown to see them as her kids. But those feelings are not reciprocated and a few months ago she heard that from all three of her stepchildren in a therapy session. She sobbed her heart out to me over it. She told me she really had believed they had built up a relationship where she was now their mother too and where they wanted to be her children, where they loved her. She said it never bothered her what they would call her but that she thought she would at least be loved back, that it wouldn't be this tragic one sided bond.

Her husband has tried reassuring her through assuring her that his kids will likely realize they love her and she is their mother when they are older. He has told her he bets she will be Mother of the Brides and Groom one day, and will be grandmother to their future grandchildren.

She has been crying to me a lot. She has admitted she has been crying every day since she miscarried the last time. She told me how people have told her adoption is an option and all she can think is how much it would pain her to share the role of mother, that she knows what it's like to not be fully accepted, to not truly be mom to the children and she doesn't think she could do it. I told her it was better to accept that about herself than to take a step that wouldn't work for her, or for the potential child. I then brought up that therapy could help her come to terms with everything. Therapy was recommended by the doctor when she was released from hospital but she was very against the idea. She refused any follow up calls about that also. I told her I love her and she can always talk to me. But she might feel better if she has a professional help her through it. She got angry at first, from her body language, then she cried harder and told me it scared her. I reassured her the best I could.

Her husband was furious with me. He said therapy doesn't work for everyone and how I was suggesting therapy because I don't think his kids are kind enough to love and embrace her one day in the future, that he knows it's what I really think and that is probably why I am pushing her to ""accept how things are"". I told him even if his kids do accept her one day, it won't help her with the grief of her losses and the loss of the baby she wanted to have so badly. He said it wasn't my place to talk to her about this. That it was his. And I suggested therapy for the wrong reasons.

"title: AITA for telling my sister she needs to stop checking in on me?
content: Bare with me here. 

My (23 they/them) sister (26) and I share a car. We split payment evenly. However, she currently is not working and I am, so I’m paying 100% of the car despite still sharing use of it with her. 

I’m the youngest of my siblings and frequently feel like I am treated as if I’m still a kid by them, but especially by her as she somewhat raised me. It’s frequently noticed by others that she still acts like my mom despite the fact I’m 23. 

I’ve been talking with my therapist about the desire to become more independent and able to go where I want without constantly having to tell people where I’m going or when I’ll be back. She’s agrees with me that it’s no one’s business as long as it doesn’t interfere with other plans. 

If I’m gone longer than expected, she virtually always sends me a text checking if I’m okay or rather just asks “you dead?”

If I’m gone for like five hours and she doesn’t know where I went in the first place, I could probably understand this. 

The issue is that we both know each other’s schedules. We have a calendar we write appointments and other things on so we know when to schedule things and not overlap. Obviously though life isn’t on a schedule so I might decide to go get dinner or stop for lunch on the way home from a doctor’s appointment. 

Which is basically what happened today. I had my first appointment with a new doctor 20 minutes away. Meaning a forty minute total drive and what anyone would assume an appointment that lasts at least an hour. Meaning at the absolute earliest, I would be home at around 2:40. I stopped on the way home to get ice cream as it’s a beautiful day. 

My sister texts me at 3:20 asking if I’m dead. 

When I get home I told her that while I appreciated the concern, she doesn’t need to ask if I’m dead when I arrive home 40 minutes later than she expects. I also told her she just generally doesn’t need to do that as I don’t need to tell her where I’m at or when I’m getting home. 

She got defensive and explained it’s not crazy to check that I didn’t get in a car accident if I’m gone for too long. 

I told her that if I was a car accident she would hear about it but that I’m an adult and considering I’m paying for the entirety of the car right now, it’s not really reasonable that she needs to know where I’m at or when I’m getting back if she doesn’t have a prior commitment.  

Eventually she just said she didn’t want to get into it and changed the subject. 

So AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t need to check in on me?",info
"title: AITA for telling my sister she was out of her mind when she said she wanted to take back my child whom I adopted from her?
content: My (36) sister N (29) got pregnant at 18. I am infertile and knew I couldn't have kids so when N said she was giving her baby for adoption, I decided to be her mom. N went no contact 5 months after giving birth. For a bit of background, N got pregnant by a one night stand and she apparently didn't remember or know the father at the time of birth but when V was 2, a man T (35) messaged me on social media claiming to be the father of my child. N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life. I got too emotional and hung up. T came home from work and on explaining to him, he was beyond furious. I then got a call from my parents saying I was an asshole for telling N she couldn't she her baby. I said I never said that and I welcomed her to bond with V but they refused to listen and said I was being insensitive and harsh and flaunting my family.

I now feel bad because me and N were very close as sisters and I feel quite close to her situation since I know the struggles of infertility. T said there was no way he was letting my sister have full time and I agree but I want to know if am the asshole for being too harsh and telling her about T.

Edit - I did legally adopt V at birth. T adopted her too after we got married. N never wanted kids and I feel the only reason she wants V now is because her husband wants kids. I don't know but I think this is it and T agrees.

Edit 2 - For all the people wandering why I said we were close, I  meant growing up.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister that at the rate she's going, my dad will be paying her rent into her 40s?
content: I have a twin sister. We are both 22. Our parents are divorced and don't get along, but all four of us were present at the time and those three actually were on the same page for this. Anyway, my sister and I were born and raised in Dallas, but she moved to Austin for college, and I stayed here for college. Well, we just graduated, but she is still staying in Austin to take a gap year. She is also moving out of the dorms into an apartment. 

Well, my dad is a complete pushover, so not only is he paying for her rent, but he is constantly going down from Dallas to Austin to set up her apartment; hauling furniture up there (it is on the second story and there is no elevator), mounting the TV, assembling desks, etc. To add insult to injury, my sister has barely helped, much preferring to grab lunch with our mom and hang out at the dog park while my dad and I slave away. 

Well, I was just dragged down there a few days ago, (and listen I get it, I'm not perfect, I have work to do, I am not fully independent, but I think I am better off than her at least) and we were laboring away. We were done for that saturday evening as my mom and sister returned, but we needed to come back at 10am on sunday to do some more work. She refused to let us come at 10am, saying it was too early and she needed her sleep, and to come at 1pm instead. 

At this point, I tell her in an irritated manner something along the lines of ""if you keep going at this rate, dad will be paying your rent well into your 40s"". My mom yelled at me something along the lines of ""at least she is independent and mature enough to live on her own unlike you"". I really did not say much back as my sister just called me a bully and my dad said I should not say rude things without purpose.

 While I did not say much back, my mind was racing. First off, I thought it is high time for my sister to grow the hell up already. Secondly my mom saying that my sister's ""independence"" is better than mine is laughable. Firstly it is easy for her to say considering my dad is footing the bill for everything while my mom has done $0 as most women are in divorce. Secondly, while I would understand it if my sister was footing the bill, she is not. My sister racked up $120k ish for her liberal arts bachelor's degree that my dad foot the bill on. And you can see what she is up to now after college. Meanwhile I stayed at home, got a scholarship, and my bill was about $30k ish that my dad paid for for a bachelor's of science in business. I wonder which is the more mature path? Now I am getting a damn job. 

As for my sister's commentary, it is not even worth spending my time on. Lastly, my dad's comment is the only one that may have some merit, and ties into why I could potentially be the asshole. ""If there is nothing nice to say, don't say it"" is a famous saying, and me not abiding by that could hypothetically make me the asshole, but I think the circumstances surrounding everything make me not the asshole. But I am bias, so it is for you to decide. Aita?",yta
"title: AITA for telling my sister there’s a reason her kids chose to live with their dad?
content: Throwaway. I (32F) have a 14 year old daughter Jess. Her father and my husband died in an accident when she was young, so it’s been just us two for a long time. As a result we are very close and she’s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they’ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first ‘boyfriend’. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it’s just the mum inside me but I couldn’t be happier for her. 

I went to my older sisters house for coffee earlier this morning. Backstory, my sister has two teenagers (16 and 17), who live almost full time with their dad. They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won’t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don’t want to live with her. 

My daughter came up in conversation and so bought up her first date. When I explained how it went, my sister laughed and told me that I must be joking. When she realised I was serious, she told me I was a terrible mother for letting my daughter walk all over me and not setting boundaries. She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said ‘I would never allow my kids to do that,’ so I replied by saying ‘That’s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.’ She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I’m wondering if I crossed the line.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister to stop making her daughter fat?
content: Hi everyone, I know weight seems to be a very sensitive topic for obvious reasons, but i swear this is coming from a place of love and concern not judgement. 

So I(24f) went to visit my older sister (43f) and my niece (7f) for a month. I haven’t seen them in almost a year since I live far. Anyway when i get there i find my niece looks several pounds heavier than I last saw her. But i don’t comment Im just happy to see them and spend time with them. Over the few weeks im there i notice that theres more junk food than there is nutritious food in the house. Then i notice just how much they order take out (junk). This concerns me as someone who also grew up with parents who didn’t prioritise health, i was very overweight all my childhood and this caused alot of health issues for me, including asthma. I was out playing with my niece and she couldnt run even 1min without wheezing.

So I decided to advise my sister on being exposing her daughter to a healthier life, not saying she mustn’t have her favourite treats but a balance. My sister took offence and i got the whole fat shaming rant. Thats im becoming the aunts who used to criticise my body when i was young and overweight. This made me feel like an AH cause those aunts added to my self esteem issues as a kid.. but i never and would never say that to my niece i just suggested my sister adjusted her diet abit.

AITA


Edit: for those who are asking the most common questions Ill just respond here as i cant reply to each comment 

1. How much did she gain?

    - she looks very overweight, to the point where     
       her neck is disappearing. 

2. How is their financial situation?

    - To be honest Im not sure but my sister just 
       bought a new car, so maybe that affects her 
       finances.  They dont seem to be struggling 
       though 

3. If my niece were skinny with same eating habits, 
    would u be concerned?

   - ABSOLUTELY. Getting all the vital nutrients is 
      important for health, and i did cook healthier 
      food a couple of times i was there just so i can 
      ensure they get all the nutrients they need.

4. Although many say Asthma is not caused by 
    weight gain, excessive weight gain does affect it 
    though.. I’m speaking from experience. The 
    moment I started losing weight, training and 
    eating healthier i stopped having asthma attacks.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family on me like it's supposed to mean something?
content: As stated in a prior post I was kicked out at 15 for being gay. From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.

My sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.

This was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as ""Family"" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.

I told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.

Before we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.

So AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?

Good Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  

I wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. 

 My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  

I have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. 

I have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.

I guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly. 

Thank you all for all your replies and support!!! ",nta
"title: AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?
content: Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” 

He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).

My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",info
"title: AITA for telling my surrogate to stop acting like she was my husband's wife?
content: 
My husband and I have been together for 5 years. We wanted kids but because of my health problems this wasn't possible.
We decided to go with surrogacy, my friend nominated her sister ( Brittany 29) I agreed right away cause I know Brittany and the family.
We've set everything up. Discussed payment, short and long term plans, counseling and dr appointments. We explored IVF and chose a private clininc to get it done.

It started after Brittany took a pregnancy test. She only told my husband though she had both our numbers. she only sent my husband a pic of the test while he was at work and sent me nothing when I gave her my personal contact info but it was okay. Things got complicated when Brittany started having access to our credit cards for her own wants and claim they were the baby's needs. She excluded me from dr visits and scans and had only my husband go with her. Her excuse was my husband drives and has time since I work and ""unavailable"" most of the time. I felt isolated from this experience but said nothing knowing she's bearing a lot of burden so I had patience. My husband had no idea what was going on and if this was normal. This was new to us so we didn't know.


She's 7 months in and last week she had us visit to discuss things that I thought we'd previously agreed on but she said she changed her mind about and her mom was there too. I heard Brittany out and was shocked when she gave a list of how things should be from now on since she said ""there was lot of confusion"" in the past cause of me stressing her out by complaining.
She requested she gets say in things like baby name after I ""deleted"" the list of names she sent to my husband.
She wanted more access to my husband's credit cards/free time to get stuff done at her place. Also more time with the baby than agreed on.
Then wrapped up by saying only my husband should be with her in the delivery room and used the hospital as excuse. I got up and firmly stated I don't agree on her new terms and that she had to stop acting like she was my husband's wife and this was their baby. My husband didn't speak til she started crying. He asked me to sit down but I said I had boundaries, reminded her what her role was and how she overstepped.

Her mom went off and and said her daughter was being mistreated when she put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for us, to make us a family. She gave up a part of her life in those months to give us what we want and I was acting selfish and ungrateful. She had us leave then told my friend and it got more complicated. I was told to apologize for what i said. IATA


Edit: yes, we agreed on paying for the surrogacy like I stated above. So no favors or anything.

Edit: No, we did not have a legal contract because my friend said there was no need for us to do that and basically talked us out of it since we are considered family but we had an agreement including paying her.

Edit: Question about whether Brittany had kids of her own. She was a single mom of a 4 year old who passed away from an accident. She had him at young age but she always seemed in good mental and physical health.",info

"title: AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?
content: I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.

Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.

Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my wife her parents cannot sleep in our bed when they are house sitting?
content: We went out of town a few weeks ago for a wedding and my inlaws came from out of state to watch our daughter. We have a 3 bedroom house with a full guest room and bathroom on the first floor and our mater and kids room upstairs. Before moving in with me my wife used to let her parents sleep in her bed when they would come visit and she would go sleep on the couch. 

Well she asked recently if they could sleep in our master room and I right away said no, I don't want anyone other than us and our kid in our bed as it feels weird to me and we have a guest room for you know guests! 

This caused a big fight to happen between my wife and me until she finally caught on to my way of seeing things but her mom was totally offended at the notion that she was not allowed to sleep in our bed. 

Am I the asshole here because I don't want my inlaws sleeping in my bed? I asked my own parents about it and they both said they would never even think of asking since we have the guest room already available...",info
"title: AITA for telling my wife she should've saved herself the trouble of cooking me a birthday dinner, considering her cookinv skills?
content: *cooking



My(28m) wife(24) has terrible cooking skills so she rarely even attempts to cook.

We have a housemaid who cooks except for sundays so we rely on takeouts every sunday. 

My birthday was on last Sunday, I don't really celebrate it so we planned that I'll have lunch with my friends and dinner with my wife. I asked her if we can go eat at some nice place and she declined saying she will arrange the dinner. I thought she was going to order something.

By the time I reached home in the evening, whole house smelled weird. She said she has cooked me a dinner.

I was stunned because that was least expected but decided to go along with that and waited until she set the table up.


I won' go into details but one dish looked half burnt and other was more like tasteless water instead of what she was calling a soup. 
The dessert was barely edible. She knew she messed up but expected me to try them all. 


I thanked her and told her we can still order or go out and she should not have bothered cooking because she knows of her poor cooking skills very well. 


She got upset and told me at least I could've tried it before she cleaned the table and told me I can order for myself. 
She had her own cooked meal and did not touched what I ordered. 


Now I look back and think maybe I was a bit too harsh, does this make me an AH?",yta

My wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. 

I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. 

Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far.",info
"title: AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable.
content: My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. 

When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" 

This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. 

At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. 

I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. 

Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",nta

I tell him I'm not really in the mood to put up with my mother and he drops it. A few days later he suggests we at least invite them over. I again refuse and he continues saying we control the interaction and that ""they're your parents, at least try to have a relationship with them.""

I again refuse saying I have no desire to interact with them ever again. He says I'm being immature and that I shouldn't hold their responses while they were grieving against them. To which I get pissed and start berating him for pushing the topic and remind him that I lost my sister too.

He apologised but I wasn't in a good mood and honestly just didn't want to be near him so I went to a mutuals. He calls the next day asking if I'm coming home soon and I tell him ""idk, do you plan on being a decent boyfriend soon?"" He says I'm being unfair and that he's sorry for pushing the subject again and I tell him to call me back when he's done being my parents' bitch.

Two days pass I go back home and he's again apologising and I tell him to save his breath. He asks if we're okay and I tell him we're fine. He apologises again and asks if I want to talk about it and I tell him ""not with you.""

"title: AITA for telling off my girlfriend after she took MDMA and went to a rave without telling me?
content: For context, me and my SO have been together over a year. 4 Months ago, we had got into an argument because she had floated the idea of doing Molly with her brother and going to a rave. I was iffy about it because she had hid something that she did that was pretty bad from me a few months before this, so my trust was a little iffy, and I wasn't ready and my trust wasn't built enough to let her go to a rave, even if she was with her brother.

I think the reason I didn't want her going at the time is a few things. Im no stranger to MDMA, I've taken it years ago, but I stopped and don't do anything now. My main problem is I don't want something happening where she may dance with another guy, or talk to another guy, or get harmed or something, I don't know, it just didn't feel like a right idea at the time. She did go with her brother, who would protect her from that, but even still, I wanted time to let the idea be okay with me.

Fastforward to today. Yesterday, she went without telling me. She told me after she did it, while she was still high on MDMA. Now here's my thing. If she would have told me before, I WOULDNT have cared, honestly. Im upset because she hid it from me. She says she hid it because it was ""last minute"" and she didn't want me to get mad at her and have an argument and cause a ""bad high"" for her, so that's supposedly why she told me after. to give more context, we do tend to get in bad arguments at small things, but in this case, I wouldn't have cared if she had told me.

I feel like I lost a bit of trust in her. I fully trusted and loved her before this, but my trust feels gone. She hid it from me. Right now, we are on break. I broke up with her because I kept trying to tell her that I didn't like that she hid it from me, and all she can say is ""im not you're property"", ""I still told you afterwards"". she did apologize, but that was only 10% of our talk, 90% is just her justifying why it was okay, Its like she's missing the point. I never told her im upset because she didn't ask me, I told her im upset she didn't tell me.

So genuinely, im open to being the asshole because I know I am at times, but can someone tell me if im justified in being upset about this?",yta
"title: AITA for telling the new neighbors that they got what they paid for, including being shunned by the neighborhood?
content: Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics – think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle.

My home’s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we’d hold parties, etc. It’s been a neighborhood treasure for years.

Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it.

The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s.

We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they’d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren’t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven’t been very friendly. The guy says that he’s surprised considering it felt like a “nice” and somewhat “affluent” neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors.

I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake?

They said they didn’t know what I meant, so I asked if they’d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.

I said “Yes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.""

The guy said “Well it’s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?”

I said “Well, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.” I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

"title: AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job?
content: I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.

We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. 

A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.

She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.

I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. 

It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.

I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)

Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.

I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. 

However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.

I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. 

She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.

"title: AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her ""You have to include everyone"" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson?
content: My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say ""No"" to things she feels uncomfortable with.

There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. 

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

OP

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?

////

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",nta

Today we saw each other at a mutual's birthday gathering and he seemed upset so I asked what the matter was and he said he was upset that the first time he was seeing me was at a party with others, despite inviting me to lunch. I told him I was busy but he brought up the fact that we live 10 minutes away and thought I'd be more keen to meet him after not seeing him since last year.

I moved out of home a while ago to go to college and found a one bedroom real cheap in a city. It was only $700 because it was affordable housing and the area was not good and I just had this entry level job I did part time while also taking classes. My mom suddenly got fired and got a new job in my city but lived liked 3 hours away. So I told her she could sleep on my couch as long as she needed and she did for like a semester. Then I got accepted into graduate school and knew that while I could still afford the apartment there might come a time it would be difficult since I would have to attend full time classes. My mother who often complained I lived in the “hood” wanted us to move into a house together in a better area. I agreed knowing that my finances might get less secure in the future. Now note that we moved and my rent is still $700 living with my mom but it is a large house (3 bed 2 bath $2200). I said we should get a roommate to make it more affordable but she didn’t want to.  in a nice area (my mom pays 3/4 the rent because she makes like three times the amount I do.

content: I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. 
A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. 
Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. 
Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said ""besides, he's right, kids need a mom"". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said ""see, it's even turning you into a pu**y"". 
My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said ""listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person"". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. 
She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless.

"title: AITA for treating my mom on her birthday, but not my dad?
content: My mom and dad's birthdays are days apart. I live in another province from them so when their birthdays come, I usually just do video calls via FB messenger. My mom's birthday comes first and on the day, I tried calling her the first thing in the morning. She didn't answer which I thought was weird since she is an early bird. Later that evening, I called again and she answered. She didn't seem happy and I asked what the celebration plans are and she said that there's nothing planned and she's too busy baking cakes for her business. I knew something was wrong at that point so I called my brother who lives nearby my parents after the call with my mom. I found out that my mom doesn't have anything planned because they're trying to minimize expenses. When I asked why, my brother said that all of their money was spent into paying another one of my father's debts. Yes, another one - for a more than a decade old 2nd hand SUV... which they didn't need because they still have a fully functioning vehicle. I got sad and mad at the same time; sad for my mom who doesn't get to at least have a nice dinner or cake on her birthday and she deserves better, and mad at my father because he's doing it again with this surprise ""purchases"" which he is unable to pay for.

I asked my wife if I can take a bit from what I was supposed to put into our savings so that I can give some money to my brother so that they can have a surprise dinner, even if it's a day after my mom's birthday. My brother agreed to arrange the party and apologized that he can't pitch in since our father also borrowed all the extra cash he had left, which is also the same situation with our youngest sibling.

The next day, the surprise party pushed through. They had dinner and cake at a restaurant and mom was teary-eyed-happy. As long as she's happy, that's all that matters to me.

A week after, father's birthday came and I sent him a greeting by text since he doesn't have any active IM account,  to which I got a thank you reply with a smiley.  I asked my brother if they had plans for father's birthday, to which unsurprisingly the answer is a resounding ""NO"". ""Can't do bro - no monnies."", which I understand completely. I didn't bother to check about the ""celebration"", or rather the lack thereof the rest of the day.

A few days after, I got a message from my aunt saying that father was heartbroken that we didn't bother to give him a celebration for his birthday, despite having one for mother. I did explain to her why and that the TLDR is the lack of funds and the fact that he basically drained my mom's bank account and wallet to pay for a debt of a purchase of an item that he didn't ""need"" and wasn't discussed to our mom prior.

content: When my oldest told me she was pregnant, she was still in college, unemployed and the baby's father was refusing to be involved.

I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.

My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. 

My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.

I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.

My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.

She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.

My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.

"title: AITA for trying to convince my ex not to date her sister’s boyfriend?
content: Before I start let me say that I know she’s her own person and can make her own decisions but I still care about her and want her to think through her actions

My ex gf (21f) has recently ended our 5 year relationship after her sister (24f) passed away. She was very emotional and ultimately decided that her and I (20m) needed to go out own ways and we broke up. It was messy and we’re both still hurting and heartbroken but she’s told me that she’s just kinda floating through life rn and just making decisions based on emotions instead of logic (she broke up with me because she felt it was right instead of because she thought it through)

While her sister was in the hospital we spent a lot of time with her brother and her sister’s boyfriend (25m), let’s call him Nate, because we were all grieving together. And eventually she started hanging out with her family without me because hanging around them was draining me mentally. Eventually her sister passed and she spent a few nights at her brothers and Nate’s places and when she came home she decided to end our relationship

 It’s been about 3 weeks since then and we both kinda hoped things would work out between us but recently she told me that while she was crying to Nate about me that he kissed her on the lips without asking. She kissed him back but they didn’t go any further and she told me the next day that she was confused but wanted to explore her options with Nate and see where things go. Obviously being told that crushed me and I felt disgusted that she would want a relationship with her dead sister’s boyfriend and I was angry at Nate for taking advantage of her while she was in such an emotional state. After trying to convince her of how gross this situation is and how she shouldn’t be doing it she still insists on seeing him and potentially starting a relationship with him. My main problem (other than not wanting her to move on yet) is that I don’t think he sees her as a real person she’s just a younger version of his dead girlfriend and he wants her back so bad he’s projecting his emotions onto her and also that he’s a known cheater and I don’t think he is going to change for my ex

I know I shouldn’t care and that it’s not my decision to make but hers but I still want what’s best for her but I just wanna know if what I’m doing is the right thing to do

TLDR: my ex is considering a relationship with her recently deceased sister’s boyfriend and I feel like that’s gross and don’t want that",yta

"title: AITA for trying to understand why our Ex friend wants nothing to do with us anymore?
content: Context: This is very recent and me and my friends are still reeling over it. Generally speaking just because we feel we were right does not mean that something we did was not wrong; however, Friend wants nothing to do with select few in our friend group because of (what we deem) lack of communication. 

I, f20, have a small college friend group. We do any and everything together. We have laughed and cried together and have been witness to the lows of the lows with some who are close. For more context: we told each other anything we felt comfortable with without judgement. Me and my roommate have the biggest dorm of all our female friends and often invite them for activities. It was not until recent (a month ago) did things suddenly change. 

Ex-friend, who I’ll call P, suddenly dropped all contact with us. We decided, collectively, to let them be; and when their whereabouts were questioned, we figured they were off with another friend of the group they had recently become close with.

We had noticed their lack of communication and distance progress until one night last week. I asked the group if it was wise to confide in another friend of the group that P had also become closer with. I will call them R. I talked to R and R took it upon themselves to tell P about how we felt. 

P then texts a long paragraph about us talking sh*t behind their backs and deemed we told anyone who would listen that P was ignoring them on purpose. In their spew they revealed that they became distant during our lunch and dinner times because I was triggering them. I was clueless.

P also began targeting me and my roommate and neglecting the feelings of another friend when they wanted to speak up. P blames this for blowing up when we should’ve come to them directly instead of confiding in someone else, when they did not communicate first about their triggers when ample help was offered. 

They called us high schoolers but gave us silent treatment for a month. They deemed us immature when all we wanted was to understand.

P said we “no longer brought them joy and company”. R later apologized and talked but requested distance as well which we did not fight. Talking to P was akin to talking to a brick wall as they continued to refused to properly address miscommunications and what could be done to resolve issues. We all apologized except for P. 

“I wish to not resolve or be friends. You are all toxic and damaging to my mental health” without further explanation or opportunity for understandings. 

We cared very much for them when they were struggling and I don’t mean to say this as grounds for obligatory friendship but I say this to help acknowledge the fact that what we did was because we cared not because we were expecting them to return favors. 

TLDR: Our ex-friend distanced themselves without communication for something they were struggling with and deemed us the toxic bad guys for wanting to understand.

"title: AITA for upsetting my coworker
content: This happened last week. My husband says I’m fine, a friend said I’m a jerk … 

I work in a cubicle farm next to several people, including Ronald (55? m). It’s a pretty quiet office as these things go, no one plays music out loud or yells when they talk on the phone, but there are about a hundred of us total so it’s not silent. We type on keyboards, open and shut drawers, talk to one another and to customers, walk around the building. Normal stuff.

Ronald is very easily annoyed by what I think is a normal level of noise. He has asked people to stop typing so loudly, complained that people’s chairs squeak too much, said that so-and-so should find quieter food to eat (we eat lunch at our desks), made someone turn down their small desk fan because it was too noisy for him, et cetera.

My job is very sedentary, and I have an issue where my legs become extremely painful if I keep them in one position too long, and I need to move them every thirty minutes or so. I usually move them on and off a pillow I keep under my desk for that purpose.

A few weeks ago I got covid, and since then my leg issue has been more painful (I’m talking to my doctor about it soon), so I bought a low stool to help elevate my legs even more and give me relief.

After I had used it for an hour or so, Ronald asked me what I was doing to make that “horrible banging noise”, and if I couldn’t stop it. I told him that I was sorry it made a noise but I have to move my legs or I’m in a lot of pain. He said it was far too loud for a shared workspace, and I said that it was a very normal and acceptable amount of noise. He called me a name and let it drop.

It’s a small wooden stepstool and it does make a little bit of noise when I move my legs on or off, but not very much. It’s like someone using a stapler or gently closing a drawer, and I only make the sound a couple of times an hour.

Am I the asshole for thinking that I can move my legs even if it annoys my coworker?",nta

If it's too hard to be decent to your kids then you shouldn't be a parent. maybe u should've helped your abusive ex husband around the house more, maybe u shouldn't have had dinner 10 minutes late, bc you know his job is stressful and it's hard being a provider and father. Next.month is father's day you should call and reconcile with him. How could I as a child stop the abusive behavior of an adult when as an adult you couldn't stop your husband from abusing you.""

content: 
My daughter recieved a bike from her uncle (my brother) on her 11th birthday, she was over the moon and excited to use it because it was on her wishlist for so long.


Days ago, I discovered that my husband reached out to my brother to ask for the recipient for the bike and returned it to the store and kept the money for himself while my daughter was at school (the bike was at home). My daughter and I got home and she started crying after noticing the bike was gone. My husband was home at the time, he told me he returned the bike and got money in return to spend on something useful for us since the bike was just there as a ""distraction"" and there was no need for it now since we're the dead of winter. I was aggravated and lost it on him saying it wasn't his, didn't come from him, and he didn't pay for it so he had no right to touch it ESPECIALLY knowing our daughter's been wanting it for a long time and my brother was decent enough to buy it for her despite barely having money to get him by. I told him what he did was theft and insisted he hand over the money to me so I could re-purchase it but he said he spent it on stuff for the house and doesn't have any money left now but I knew about the money he was stashing away in the bedroom that he forbade me from toucing and I took some of it and went out to re-purchase the bike while he was out the next day.

He found out and verbally lashed out at me saying I should've never touched the money he was saving for himself which isn't much but I lashed right back that I had to so I could re-purchase the bike he took from under our daughter. He explained that he didn't keep the money for himself and instead spent it for necessities for our home but he was at fault for taking the bike in the first place and he was responsible for getting it back. He yelled at me for almost 10 minutes then stormed outside and started smoking.

My daughter asked why her dad was upset and that she no longer wants the bike if dad doesn't want her to have it, but I assured her that's not the case and told her she shouldn't feel guilty and to just focus on enjoying her bike.

My husband hasn't stopped grilling me about how I disrespected and undermined him and managed to make our daughter hate him after making him look like the bad guy, I again said he shouldn't have touched the bike, end of the story/// He's called me theif and juvenile for taking money from his savings and being sneaky about it.

"title: AITA for using my moms religion against her after insulting my sons hair?
content: I (32F) was raised Mormon but I’m not now, nor do I follow any other religion. My mom is still very much in the cult. As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she’d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn’t often.

She’s visiting right now. I don’t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It’s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He’s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. 

Not long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she’s given her opinion on it. Why don’t I cut it? Don’t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he’s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn’t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I’m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he’s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes “girl,” that’s on them and a simple “he’s a boy” corrects it. But mostly it’s because I don’t fucking want to. 

She got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: “Well I just don’t like long hair on boys.” Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that’s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. 
I said the first thing which came to my head, which was: “If you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.”

Bruh. If looks could kill, I’d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn’t say anything else. She hasn’t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don’t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won’t bring it up anymore. 

I feel like we’re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don’t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.

Update: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn’t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I’m glad I could make so many of you laugh. I’m here all night. Seriously though, working until 7 am and gonna waste it all reading comments. See you all in the telestial kingdom.",nta

We lived together in the house I owned, she wasn’t on the mortgage, and didn’t pay for it. I gave her a few months to get out of the house, buy her own with the BD, and get her stuff. She even hired movers. She comes from more money than me and had more money, so she bought a lot of stuff for the house and left it. Firepit outside? Left it. Dryer? Left it. Then never spoke to me again. 

Over time, I slowly started using the stuff. Since she has been long gone, I will use the firepit with friends or new dates. And now that I’m dating, my new partner. This got back to her with mutuals and she is going around saying I’m a f*ck boy who reuses one woman’s stuff for another. 

It’s upsetting but I’m starting to think they are right. AITA for not tossing out all of this stuff and buying new things? I grew up poor and was raised not to be wasteful. If the dryer is still working, I’m gonna use it. But I’m so tired of her telling other people some other woman is using her dryer for their clothes. 

(Property law where I live says if it’s been abandoned on my property for more than 60 days it’s mine, so legally I’m clear. But ethically not so sure.)",nta
"title: AITA for using weaponized incompetence?
content: I (F36) have MS and one of the things that happens to me is my leg will twitch and it usually happens when I’m seated. Its often sore and It’s uncontrollable. Because if this, I’m afraid of driving. Surely rightfully so? 
Well, my husband (38) is getting sick of me not driving and being too scared to. I get it. Driving someone around would be a pain in the leg (huehue) but if I drive and my leg starts twitching, that’s it. I won’t be able to stop and I could cause an accident. He says i’m using weaponized incompetence to get people to drive me around. Sometimes I will spend so much money on an uber just to avoid hearing him putting me down. I feel like it’s getting to a point where I never want to leave the house and just ask for all my appointments to be via zoom. 
Is what I’m doing wrong? AITA?

Edit: Thank you all so much. It has been eating at me me all day long and honestly, has had me in tears. This is the one thing I really need assistance with. Everything I’m fine to do it on my own. I am thankful for the responses. I think I just wanted to really make sure I wasn’t using my condition to not drive.

"title: AITA for walking out after a boss tried to refuse to accept my resignation?
content: I had a boss who was a real turd. He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. 

I turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar. Guess you’re here to stay.” I got so furious and decided that was it. I said “well screw this then, I quit. Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. 

A former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?",info
"title: AITA for walking out on my job?
content: I(29f) work as a waitress at a restaurant with a point system. It's 1 point if you are late, 3 points to call off with notice, and 5 points for calling off within 4 hours of your shift. This is fine with me as I have no points this year and have only called off once since 2018. I'm the type who covers shifts, stays late and generally just go to do my job.

Last week, I ended up calling off and was out for a week due to being hospitalized in the ICU with a horrible infection. I let my boss know at 2am that I was being sent out by helicopter and kept her informed of everything going on. Today was my first day back. I'm not 100% yet but like many places, we are short staffed. When I came in today, I opened and got to work. My boss came in 2 hours later and called me into her office. She informed me I was getting 8 points, losing my discounts and bonuses for 90 days, and was on probation. I was dumbfounded and told her I wasn't signing the papers as it was out of my control. She said if I didn't, I would be terminated. I told her not to bother and walked out. 

I'm now getting calls and texts from her and my coworkers saying they need me and I was an ass for quiting over something so small. My husband thinks I was in the right because it was ridiculous that I was getting punished for almost dying.

My partner and I have been together for 9 years and this is a disagreement we have had every year for the past 7 years. Between us, we have 3 children. I have 2 teenagers from a previous relationship and he has 1 who is 11 from a previous relationship.

On my birthday I want to do nothing. I want to lay around, watch TV, nap and maybe go out to dinner.

He insists that there must be an event every year because it should be about the kids celebrating my birthday. One year it was a beach trip, another year it was a party.

I feel like the kids are old enough to understand that birthday's are the one day a year that you can do what you want within reason, of course.

We recently had this same argument because he wants to plan another beach trip for my birthday and I don't want to go. We can go any other day, just not my birthday. He says I'm being a selfish AH who won't suck it up for our kids.

"title: AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?
content: I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",info
"title: AITA for wanting my husband to spend time with my family
content: I (30f) and my husband (36m) have been married for nearly three years and we gave a 1 year old child together. Some context...he's Indian. He immigrated from there in 2015 for work, and his entire family is still in India. I'm American. 
One of the things that attracted me to him when we were first dating was the importance he put on family. He is extremely family oriented and has a great relationship with his family. He seemed to love my parents as well. Shortly after dating however, my parents unexpectedly divorced and my dad moved out of country. He was supportive of my mom while we helped her through her healing process. I also have one brother who I am not very close with but our relationship is amicable. 
Since our marriage, I have felt him drifting from my family. Whenever we get together he tends to find a reason why either he can't be there or will be late. It's been a sore subject for us in the past when we've tried to talk about. I know he compares my small  (and now broken)  quieter family to his big and loud family. And due to Covid, he was away from his family for 3 years and missed them terribly. We visited them in India last year for five weeks and I was hoping that would improve his morale. 
Fast forward to now, my mom just bought a house 15 minutes away. My family has gotten together a few times (my brother and his family are in the same city) and my husband is already finding reasons not to be present at our gatherings.
 My mom personally invited him via text to an upcoming gathering.  She mentioned it being a BBQ (we are vegetarians) and he said he probably wouldn't join but he would see everybody this weekend. My family always makes vegetarian food for us as well. She told him that she hopes our food preferences won't stop us from getting together and that she hopes they can talk about things further in the future.
This set off a big fight between us. He thinks my mom is trying to control him and he says he just has no connection with my family. He also said we should just deal with our own families separately to avoid problems. I told him if we continue with that mentality our relationship will end in divorce. Now we can't even talk to each other. 
This was difficult to sum up with all the intricacies of this situation, but am I the asshole here? I want our child to see us both involved in each other's families and I feel like compromise might be necessary on both our parts to make that happen.",info
"title: AITA for wanting my mother to quit drinking?
content: My (F20) mam (F53) is an alcoholic, and about a year ago (after YEARS of me trying to make her acknowledge this) she finally got into AA. She told me she had stopped drinking about 3/4 months ago and I didn’t completely believe her but family told me it was true. I let her know how hurt I was by her drinking when I was a kid as it made her be mean to me and I don’t want to be around her when she’s drunk. It triggers my panic attacks, and I know that’s not her problem, but if she refuses to even try to stop drinking at least while I’m around (usually every 2-4 months) then I’m not coming to visit anymore.

On my most recent visit she has been acting like she’s not drinking at all. A couple of times I’ve caught her acting drunk and she insists I’m wrong and that she likes to have a laugh sometimes. 

I found two boxes of wine hidden under the sink when looking for a baking tray and asked my dad about them and he said he occasionally has a glass of wine. He’s not an alcoholic. 

Then the other night she was slurring and I asked her to stick out her tongue. It was black. I said have you been drinking and she said a firm no and again made fun of me. I checked under the sink and the two boxes of wine were down to half a box. I asked her and she admitted to having one glass that one night. I noticed she was drinking it out of a mug (how she has her tea) as opposed to in the wine glasses she usually drinks wine from. 

I spoke to my mam about this in a private moment and she apologized and said she knew it made me uncomfortable and promised not to do it again.

Last night me and my sister and her friends were going into town, which I’ve never done in this city before. I was nervous and expressed that if I needed her, would mam be able to pick me up. My sister then told me mam was drunk and wouldn’t be able to drive. I saw she was drinking out of a mug again, trying to hide it from me.

Today we had a talk and she told me she has a couple glasses every night. This means every time I asked if she was drinking when she was acting drunk she had lied to me and made me out to be overreacting and not being able to have fun. 

I honestly feel gaslit and betrayed. I have very poor mental health and struggle with my hold on reality so gaslighting is very serious and dangerous with me, more than most. Im not trying to control her but if it triggers me, I want to stay away from it, that’s just the healthy choice for me. I thought we told each other everything and to find out she’s been lying to my face, broken promises and gaslit me is honestly crushing. t’s summer and I was planning on visiting a lot and helping them do up my grandads old house for them to move into, but this really is a blow and I don’t feel entirely safe here anymore.

"title: AITA for wanting my roommate to keep his dog from chewing my shoes?
content: So my roommate got a puppy a couple months ago and the puppy has been a good boy until this recently.
My roommate and I leave our shoes next to the front door and his puppy recently started chewing on only my shoes. When I brought this up last week, he stated that I should just ""put my shoes in my room"", which I feel is bad dog ownership. Why should I change my habits for your dog? 
So I've been putting them in my room to avoid an issue but tonight I forgot to and his dog got at my shoes again. Two pairs of my shoes down I feel like he should train/watch his dog, but I already know what his response will be. 
So AITA for not putting my shoes up and expecting him to watch his dog?

Edit: I understand puppies do puppy things but I don't like my roommate saying to put my shoes up when his dog is the issue. It sounds like my roommate would rather train me than train his dog, while shirking any responsibility of a dog owner. The issue is the dog because if there was no dog, there would be no chewed shoes, even if they were at the front door. Also, how long am I supposed to excuse his puppy's behavior because of its age?",nta
"title: AITA for wanting my sister to delete her graduation pic on instagram since I was so embarrassed about how I looked in it?
content: So I was just chilling when I got notified that I was tagged in a post. I checked it out and my sister had tagged me in a college graduation post on instagram. She made one post which had 10 photos where you can swipe to see each one. There were pictures of her and her with her friends, but the first one was a family picture(it had me, my sister, mom, and dad). I cringed so hard and felt really embarrassed because I believed I looked so revolting in the picture like no thanks. She has a good amount of followers and many of them know me. I begged her to delete it because I’m so self-conscious and I hate to admit it but I was actually crying. She refused to delete it and said I am being overdramatic and to mind my own business. But I feel like it IS my business since she’s posting a picture with me in it without my consent. I told her she’s being a bit selfish, but she said it’s her graduation so she deserves to be selfish. On the other hand though, I was being selfish for wanting her to remove a photo she wanted others to see. 

She eventually ended up reposting it without including the picture that I was in, but she is pissed at me now and said that I tainted our relationship as siblings. She removed me from her followers so I can no longer see her posts and “ to stay out of her business” from now on. To add on, earlier I did tell her that she could crop me out, but that wasn’t good enough. A bit later I said that she could post another similar family photo, but she said it’s too late cause she already made another post without the family pic. This was all in a span of like 15 minutes by the way. I feel guilty because I made her delete something she really wanted to post, but at the same time I just really couldn’t help how embarrassed I felt. Please comment your thoughts, thank you.

Edit: I appreciate all of the feedback already! Just wanted to mention that my mom is the one who wanted to take a family picture for memories’ sake, so I had no idea it would be posted.",yta
"title: AITA for wanting to cancel my trip planned with boyfriend and his family?
content: So my boyfriend sister begged us to go to the Virgin Islands with her this summer for her birthday. I really didnt want to but she begged us and I obliged. My boyfriend really wanted to go too. The problem is. My boyfriend is unemployed right now. He’s been looking for 2 years since graduating and he hasn’t found anything yet. So as of right now I pay for everything. I told him in March (when I booked the trip) that if he doesn’t help me pay for half the trip. I will be pissed and will cancel. So far the trip has costed $8000 with Airbnb and plane tickets. (The Virgin Islands is not cheap to fly to) he has only given me $1200 he got from a friend who owed him money. And that isn’t including the food that we will be eating. So the trip will likely cost much more. I told him he has until May 27 to figure it out, because that is when I can cancel the Airbnb for a full refund. I told him I will be cancelling if he doesn’t have anything lined up by then.  Am I the asshole?

Edit; I just wanted to clarify money isn’t the issue for me, I can easily afford to pay for this trip as I have a good job. But the issue here is that he is unemployed and we had an agreement he would help pay for the trip, someway or another. He’s had since March to try and raise money for this trip and has done nothing.

Also I wanted to thank you guys for validating my feelings, I really was feeling like I would be a jerk for doing this and cancelling everyone’s fun. (His sister will be pissed at me I am sure) so it is nice knowing I am not in the wrong here.",nta
"title: AITA for wanting to change my cats name?
content: Some backstory: my friend recently lost a very important family member and wanted to get a cat for emotional support. She got the cat but decided that she couldn’t keep him because her mom is terrified and had an absolute meltdown when she tried to bring the kitty in. She was heartbroken about not being able to keep the cat and asked me if I would take him. I was reluctant at first, telling her that it wouldn’t feel right to keep him because he was originally meant to be hers, and I wanted her to fight to keep this kitten because of how important it was for her. She was adamant that she wouldn’t be able to keep him and so I agreed to take him in. I love animals and I also love her, so I thought this way, at least she’d still be able to see the cat whenever she would like, and I get to adopt an adorable kitty. 

Fast forward to a couple days ago, we got into an argument because she found out that I want to change the cats name. She begged me not to, saying that his name now is “perfect” and “how could I want to change his name when I said it didn’t even feel right keeping him in the first place” and that “I’m saying one thing but doing another”

My friends and family are split. Some are saying that I shouldn’t change the name, and some are saying if it’s my cat and I’m taking full responsibility for it then I have every right to change the name. For reference: no, I am not asking her to pay for his food, vet bills, etc. I am 100% raising this cat alone.

"title: AITA for wanting to fly in first class?
content: My older brother went to a college far from our hometown. He had to take a plane to travel to and from his college. He went to college before the pandemic. Back then, our father was travelling a lot for work and had an elite status with an airline. Because of this, my brother would often (80% of the time) get upgraded to first class for free even though our parents bought him an economy ticket. The flight was a short four hour domestic flight so first class usually just meant sitting in the front of the plane in a larger couch-like seat and getting better snacks/meals. But sometimes, the flight would take place in larger planes and my brother would get to convert the seat into a bed and sleep.

Then, the pandemic happened and our father couldn't travel for work and was working from home. Because he wasn't flying anymore, he lost his elite status with the airline. I am now about to go to the same college as my brother. My parents said I won't be able to fly in first class like my brother since my father no longer has his elite status. I asked my parents if they could pay extra money so I could fly in first class like my brother did, but they said no. They said they're paying roughly the same amount for my flights as they did my brother so things are already fair. They told me to stop acting entitled. I think my parents are playing favorites though - they let my brother fly first class but not me.

"title: AITA for wanting to move in a decade?
content: What the issue is: 
I want to move in ten years to a larger place but my partner would rather stay in our first home forever. 

Why I could be wrong: 
My partner worked hard to afford this place, he doesn’t want to move. 

My perspective: 
- our first home is more of a starter home (it’s not a lot of space) 
- our condo fees are high 
- I wanted to buy a larger unit from the start, but at the time of purchase my partner was making far less than now
- I work remotely from the den, and it doesn’t have a window or any natural light and it’s depressing
- I want to use our condo’s appreciation as a down payment on a bigger one in ten years. 

Partner’s Perspective: 
- we can retire early and travel
- it was expensive to buy this one 
- costs associated with buying and selling are high
- furniture might not fit as well in the next unit 



I should add: I patiently put off buying so that my partner to pay their student loans and credit card debt, despite having my half since 2020. Prices and interest rates have risen to what he considers “too high” because of waiting on my partner to be ready.",info

I think my history may be clouding my judgement here and making me selfish but, at the same time, I'm having a hard time seeing how I'm wrong. I'm hoping you guys can give me some clarity.

All I want to do for mother's day is spend the day with my husband and baby and go for a nice lunch at my favorite restaurant. This has apparently pissed everyone off. My mother wants us to drive 1.5 hours to spend mother's day with her. I really don't want to spend 3 hours in a car with a five month old in one day. My MIL wants us to have lunch with her before she goes and has dinner with her mother.

She does not want to go to the restaurant that I want to go to, and we can't go to that restaurant for dinner because of the baby's bedtime.

Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like this is my first mother's day and we should do what I want and everyone else can suck it up.

My bf(30) and I(27f) are together for almost 2 years now and I usually don’t really celebrate my birthday, but I really love spending time with my bf and I loved how he made me feel special on my last birthday because no one has ever made that big of an effort for me. 

This year one of his friends wants to go party at the club on saturday (my birthday) because he will leave town for 3 months. Funny thing is I told him the day before he announced this to my bf that it’s my birthday on that day. Also, my bf obviously forgot about it because today he told me “my friend is planning to go out with all of us on saturday” and I said “well, guess whose birthday is on saturday” and he goes “oh, it’s on saturday?”. He then asked me if it would be ok if he leaves at the evening to be with his friends because I would be working anyways until 10:30 PM. I told him that it would make me sad because I would be alone on my birthday evening. He then asked me if I wouldn’t feel bad if everybody was at the party and he would be the only one missing out. 

I got really sad because I felt like my birthday is not important to him and because he made it seem like it was natural for him to go out with his friends on my birthday.
I want to add that I don’t have a problem when my bf is going out with his friends, I really like when he spends time with them. I can spend time by myself and also often need some alone time BUT my birthday is really not the kind of day that I would like to spend alone.

I told my mom that I no longer wanted my aunt coming to my wedding and that I was going to uninvite her if she couldn't he come to my shower. (I am paying for my wedding with my fiancé). My mom justified her behavior and said that it wasn't about the money and we should be used to this behavior. I am so upset because I've planned this day since I was a little girl and don't want my aunt to ruin it. I don't care if this causes issues with my family because at the end of the day it's my wedding. I don't get to have a redo, unlike
Holidays and birthday parties. I am at a loss feel like I am TA because I know my aunt will be upset. I am just sick of dealing with the behavior don't want to deal with it at my wedding.",nta
"title: AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?
content: Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- I was wearing headphones all the time.

\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.

\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",yta
"title: AITA for watching a youtube video while on call with my SO?
content: My SO and I have been in a long distance relationship for 3 years now. Everyday we call each other for about 6 hours.

Sometimes  we just feel like hanging out together and do our own thing. Often in  these times SO will watch a cutscene from the game we play and I will be  watching a youtube video in the meanwhile. They are aware that I do  this and perfectly OK with  it. Even while we are talking, SO often  plays Tetris on their computer. I am obviously fine with that, too, I  don't really care what they're doing as long as they're with me.

Today  I asked for their opinion about something in our game that I forgot  they wouldn't know about yet. They realised that I had spoiled them, and  I felt terrible about it. I should've been more careful.

It  upset them greatly. They became quiet, I learned that prodding them,  trying to keep up the conversation or moving on to other things upsets  them further, so I just keep my mouth shut and wait until they want to  speak again.

While we sat in  silence, we were waiting in queue for a duty in the game, so I just sat  here twiddling my thumbs until I decided to watch some youtube. After a  few minutes SO asks me if I said anything. I say ""no,  why?"" and they  explain that they heard a noise. I said it might be that  my mic picked  up some sound from the video I was watching. They got more upset with  me, saying I shouldn't be watching videos while on call  with them  because it's rude. In the moment I just apologised, and we did a  dungeon.

Afterwards, I told SO I  was quite upset with them for scolding me about watching a video, since  we were sitting in silence anyway, and I thought it was pretty  ridiculous that they dictate what I can and cannot do when it doesn't  change the fact that I am quiet on the call. They said that they weren't  busy with anything else, just sitting there, and they expected me to be  sitting there with them. They said if I wanted to watch a video I  should have told them at least. I was pretty insulted that I have to  announce what I am doing to them because it doesn't affect them either  way, and they're often doing other things, too.

They  said it makes them feel like I'm not really there, that I'm not paying  attention to them. I  said that was nonsense, because they wouldn't have  even known I was watching a video, and when they did speak to me I   paused it and responded to them. I believe it is quite stupid to expect  me to quietly sit with them, but they believe it is terrible that I  can't see how rude it is that I watched a video while they were feeling  down. We didn't come to any kind of agreement here, and SO got angry and  left the call.

I would appreciate some outsiders perspective here. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for watching and doing nothing to help my husband when he was extremely ill?
content: My (27f) husband ""Tim"" (36m) has a serious dairy allergy. I'm talking about an actual immune system reaction, not intolerance. His allergy is serious enough to cause acute Enterocolitis, but he hasn't needed an epi-pen since he was a kid.

I work full time and also have some seasonal work this holiday season because Tim has been without work, and money has been very tight. As a result, I barely get to rest. The holiday are especially hard, and I found myself getting just one day off every 2 weeks for almost 2 months straight. As you can imagine, that day off means the universe to me. 

Now, Tim LOVES dairy, and will sometimes intentionally eat things which trigger his allergy. Lately, it's gotten out of hand, with him going from one risky meal every 4-6 months, to every 2 or so weeks. In fact, it always seemed to coincidentally line up with my time off, and I found myself spending my one day taking care of him. Last week, I finally asked him if he was intentionally timing it to line up with my day off. I fully expected him to say no, but he admitted that he was doing it to make sure that he'd have a nurse, and so he'd have someone close by in case he had an especially adverse reaction and needed a hospital. I was livid, and told him that he was selfish, robbing me of my rest. I said that if he made himself sick again, I wouldn't take care of him. I'm exhausted and I need to decompress. He didn't say much, so I thought he'd heard me.

Fast forward to Friday night. I get home from work, and a few minutes in, Tim gets a pizza delivered. I ask him why, when I'm making dinner and he shrugs. I ask if a large garlic Alfredo pizza is worth the pain, and remind him that I won't be giving up my rest day again. He smirks and eats an entire slice while grinning at me. I left it at that and went back to my dinner.

Predictably, he got sick, profusely vomiting, retching and groaning from the intense cramping and diarrhea. I slept in the guest room to get away from the sound and smell. He called for me several times and I repeatedly told him no. Hours later, he was still sick and woke me up at the crack of dawn to go get him pedialyte and meds because he was very dehydrated and still in pain. I told him to order it in and asked him to get out and let me sleep. 

He was still whimpering when I eventually got up to shower and eat. Again, I did nothing to help or comfort him. By evening, he was sulking, and by morning when I had to work, he was enraged. He yelled, and by the end of the day he'd told our friends and family that he nearly died and I neglected him. His family accused me of passively trying to kill him. His mom called, shouting that he could've had a life threatening reaction due to my petty actions, and that I'm a shit wife for not minding his health.
I'm starting to feel guilty because she's right and he could've been seriously hurt.

"title: AITA for wearing a wedding dress at a wedding?
content: So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.

A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn’t. I’m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.

I didn’t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.

After ten minutes my friend’s fiancé walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.

He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn’t know this was the wedding.

I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.

I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn’t bother her after that and the party soon ended.

I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.

That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.

She didn’t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it’s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.

I’ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn’t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.

So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?

Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I’m also Australian and I’ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy. Everyone was dressed up in funny costumes

"title: AITA for wearing noise cancelling headphones when our baby is crying?
content: Forward: I'm pretty certain I'm the asshole, family agree I'm in the wrong, but one friend is saying I'm not. Also even if I'm not the asshole, my wife isn't either, she's an incredible mum, amazing wife, and the love of my life.

Me (33M) and my wife (30F) have a little baby (0.25F) who for the mostpart is a chill and happy little thing who makes our world shine. But as with any baby she cries and sometimes a lot.

I'm diagnosed autistic and as a result have some pretty severe sensory issues particularly around sound, and particularly when I'm tired. I have noise cancelling headphones which are a godsend so I started wearing them when I found her crying too overwhelming, particularly when I get up at night with her.

To clarify, I can still hear her crying and I don't put them on so I can ignore her crying. Quite the opposite, I wear them so I can hold her without feeling overwhelmed. Also it's just her being a baby, not a medical thing. Most of the time she's a joy, I love our 2am feeds when it feels like nobody else in the world is awake except us, enjoying the stillness and solitude. I love her so much.

My wife hates it and has asked me to stop. She said that being a parent involves having to cope with the bad stuff, it's what we signed up for and that it's important not to block out her crying so I can feel what our daughter is feeling. She also said that it probably scares our daughter to see her dad with stuff on his head when she's at her most distressed. What she said makes a lot of sense so I stopped wearing them and handled the resulting meltdowns afterwards. But when I was talking to a friend he said that's an unreasonable demand, I'm not a bad dad and my needs with my disability matter too.

content: **UPDATE: i haven't logged into this account in a while but i tried to update and it got removed so i will just copy and paste it into here**

**I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**

A while ago my daughter\[8f\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have

"title: AITA for writing my mom a letter?
content: I’ll try and keep this brief, in a nutshell though, my father died 4 years ago.  That same year I ended up leaving my now ex-husband. My mother has become very bitter and angry.  She drinks a lot more than she used to, and it’s become quite a task to speak to her.  She makes these horrible comments about my dad and has recently decided to make rude comments to me about my boyfriend John.   I haven’t called/spoken to my mother in 6 months.  About 6 weeks ago I decided to write my mom a letter letting her know how I feel about things.  This is the letter I sent her:

Dear mom,

I love you.  You are my mother and I don’t want you to think I am ungrateful for everything you’ve done for me.  I am writing this so I can explain why I haven’t called.   

Please stop insulting John’s intelligence.  You don’t know him that well.  It’s appalling how quick and easy it is to judge someone.  John makes me happy, I wish that was enough for you.  He has never used money or other things to control me, he will never gaslight or abuse me, and he certainly will never use my son as a tool to hurt me.  I wish this mattered to you more than John’s IQ.   

Ever since dad died you have become very despondent.  It hurts my heart every time you complain about him and speak about him like he wasn’t the man we all know he was.  I think you need to be angry at him so you don’t get sad.  This has made it very difficult to talk to you.  

I get the impression you have just given up.  You used to be active  You’d go shopping, see your friends, garden, do stained glass.  Now you barely leave your neighborhood.  I know things become challenging with age, but you’re not old enough to use that as an excuse.  

I am deeply hurt you wouldn’t testify at my divorce trial.  You wouldn’t even answer my lawyer’s phone calls.  I needed you for 1 day.  I needed 1 person- you- to tell the judge I was a good mother.  It would’ve made a difference, the judge stated that in the divorce decree.  Why wouldn’t you help me? Do you think I wasn’t a good mother?

In a nutshell mom these are the reasons why I stopped reaching out.  I would love to talk to you if you and I can come up with some healthy boundaries to allow this relationship to continue.  I’m leaving this up to you, I love you, me.  

My twin Maddy decided to go off on me via texts about this, saying that I should be ashamed of the “dumpster fire” I call a letter and that it was a vicious, hateful attack on our mom.   I responded and told her that I wrote her the letter because it was a way for me to express myself in a clear, concise manner, because talking to my mom about any non-topical issues can make me very emotional, and Maddy is the same way.  I haven’t responded to Maddy’s texts.  She texted me some random bs a few days later about genealogy or something, I believe that was her attempt to feel out the situation.

"title: AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face
content: My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

"title: AITA for yelling at my bf while he tried to apologise after an argument?
content: For some context, my bf (25m) and I (25f) have been together for almost 8 years and living together for 2 years. We went through some heavy stuff together, including my dad's death 6 years ago. Ever since then, I've had trouble expressing my emotions when I'm sad or worried. I physically cannot cry infront of other people (including my own family and his) and sometimes even him, though that has gotten better, as I'm trying to be more in touch with my emotions.

Now he knows this has been hard for me, because people close to me have called me cold, heartless or not normal for it. For example, 2 years ago when we were moving in together, his parents took my  cat, because were moving somewhere not cat friendly. They grew very attached to my cat and loved it as much as i did.
Sadly my cat got hit by a car and had to be put down. I took that pretty hard and had a breakdown at home, with my bf being there and comforting me. We buried the cat at his parents house and his parents were also super emotional and crying, while I stayed calm, didn't cry and tried to comfort them,  because they felt guilty and kept apologising to me. My bf later told me that his parents found it 'very weird' that I didn't cry and asked him if I didn't care as much. 

Fast forward to yesterday, when my grandma (she had a stroke last year and my mom and my aunt have been taking care of her at my aunts home ever since, because she can't walk and her right side is paralysed) had a heartattack and the doctor said it is only a matter of days until she dies. 
I told my bf and when I got home he immediately hugged me and tried to comfort me, but I said that I was fine. He then told me that that wasn't normal and asked if I would even care if she died. 
I got upset and told him of course I cared, but I didn't really 'feel it yet' and I was more worried if my mom would be okay, because she is (understandably) not the most emotionally stable person.
Afterwards he apologised and said he was sorry for saying I didn't care. But somehow I was still really mad at him for disregarding how i dealt with the situation and started yelling, asking how hard it was to think before he opens his mouth and how he knows that I am sensitive to this specific issue. 
I left the apartment to try and cool off and when I got back he apologised again, telling me he said those things because he was worried I was in denial about my feelings and how not dealing with that is unhealthy and he wanted me to be able to talk to him.

Now I feel really bad for snapping at him and wanted to know AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for yelling at my dad after he gives away something that belongs to me
content: A little backstory me and my older brother have this box filled with lehos from the 90s and 2000s . It qas originally his but he passed it doen to me when I was a child. We both spent good years playing with it alone and with friends while growing up and never had the intention of selling it or giving it away.I also would like to add that the items were mostly purchased by my beloved grandmother (who passed a few years ago) and the items are something that me and my brother cherish and have as a shared  sentimental item.Now to the main point,my father invited some of our well known family friends (2 parents and 1 child that's around 4-5) They don't come to our house often and when they do it's always nice spending time with them , the issue isn't them tho. We were getting stuff ready for dinner and I wasn't going to join them since I had plans with friends(everyone was aware and ok with it) The child ig was getting bored cuz my dad brought out the lego box (without my knowledge ) and At first I was like "" ok that's fine, he'll just play with it and then we'll put it back"" that did not indeed happen. My father instead , gave it away to the child without asking me or my brother or anyone for that matter and I know for a fact that the child will play with it for 2 days tops since it has a lot 9f toys at home .I mean I would've given it to some kid one day but only if it was on my and my brothers terms.  We're still grieving and these toys as stupid as it sounds help us remember the good times. Anyway when I found out days later (not from my dad btw but my mom) I got furious and started yelling at him and just lashing out . I'd also like to mention that my brother hasn't found out yet (he lives abroad so there's no way he'd know) I was going to tell him but my mother advised against it since he'd get very upset and it wouldn't end well.

"title: AITA for yelling at my husband and telling him to get over himself after he threw away my tampon box?
content: 
We (Me 27, him 30) together for 3, married for 2 months.


So here's a thing, I used to use pads for my periods but recently was able to start using tampons (I have medical problems) in comparison, Tampons work 10x better for me, especially when I'm outside...say like at work or traveling. My husband Ryan hates them, he never truely gave a reason other than just say...he doesn't feel comfortable with *me* using *them* . I didn't think it was a big deal at first since he said he hates a lot of stuff that I do but ""puts up"" with it anyway except for this. He asked that I go back to using pads but I made it clear since it's my body then I get to decide.


He threw away some tampons he had access to, and I was getting upset but*!!!!* to keep the peace, I just bought a box and hid it away from him. he somehow found it and threw it away. I didn't find that out til I had my period yesterday and realized I had no tampons to use. I was tired, and too stressed I just yelled at him after he admitted to throwing away the whole box. He argued that I already knew how he felt about *this stuff* and yet I decided to still *keep it around*. I lost it and told him he had no right to do this and told him to get over himself already. He stared at me almost about to tear up or something, then walked out.


He later went on about how we, as a couple should take each other's discomfert into consuderation and said he already tried to speak to me about those tampons yet I brushed him off and insulted him and verbally abused him. He also said that if I still insist on using them then I should do it while I'm outside the house but I said that it won't happen. I feel bad for how it played out but I was just at my wet's end and in so much pain I lashed out.

"title: AITA for yelling at my older brother?
content: I (f15) yelled at my brother last night (m19) for switching on the air con in the morning, before leaving the apartment, and I came home to it still switched on. First of all, it is really cold today and yesterday, where I am, winter is going to start soon and I’ve been freezing all day at school and throughout the day, so there’s literally NO reason for the air con to be switched on, also the fact that it is so expensive, my family is not that rich, the air con just comes with the apartment we are renting. BTW my brother doesn’t live with us, he left the house for ‘Independence’ (he struggles with money, my parents have to send him $400 a month, he’s gotten fired from ALL his jobs because of the way he acts so clueless, and he doesn’t see anything wrong), so he came home for 2 days as usual a week and this happened. 

I left the house at 7AM, he was asleep but I assume he left at around 10, and I came home at 7PM, to find it switched on as I was freezing when i got home, the house is usually warm, which means it was on for at least 9+ hours in an empty house. I was so mad, the moment my brother got back, I yelled at him. I should have been more considerate but I was so angry. Maybe I shouldn’t have but he got upset at me and said that I’m 15 and shouldn’t yell at my brother. I understand that, but things like this as well as this situation has happened so many times, I’ve even defended him from my parents once, but I just completely blew up at him. He told my parents and now they are mad at me and said I need to respect my brother. I agree, but are they reallu not addressing what he did? AITA? 

Also: He is irresponsible with his money, he usually goes out to restaurants to eat almost everyday as he has no skill to cook, He can’t do chores (my parents do his washing and my mum will go to his apartment to clean every once in a while), and even with this he STILL only calls my parents for money/help (asks my mum to pick him up at 11PM since he can’t drive, public transport is shut down), and comes home only for free food. He never talks to us, my parents make him a meal and he sits and watches his shows with headphones on, then when he’s done, he leaves his dirty plate on the table. I could do all of this since the age 14. When we go out together, I have to pay his meal + other stuff with my own pocket money and money I earn from my job, so I just stopped hanging out with him. When he’s over I always cook his meals and washes up .Honestly I love my brother so much, he’s my brother I take care of him sometimes when my parents go overseas, but I’m tired of being the big sister of my 4 years older brother, so seeing him do this made me so mad. This has just become an AITA for being so annoyed with my brother post.",yta
"title: AITA for “starting an argument”with my mom
content: So I’ve (16) been having really bad migraines for the past year or so. They flair up when I have to study/ doing exams or have heavy school work. You might be thinking it’s stress but I’m actually not a very stressed person about exams/ school. 

Anyway I’m almost certain it’s because I haven’t been wearing my glasses. I’m blind in one eye so my right does all the work. This leads to it become strained when I’m doing a lot of reading / writing. So much last year that I had to go to the hospital from a migraine. 

I’ve expressed to my mother I need to get reading glasses because my right eye is straining leading to my headaches. She says she’ll call doctor but then doesn’t. Like sure she forgets but she never takes me serious like ever she’ll always leave anything I ask till I have to ask 20 times! I am very grateful for my mom but she is just a very aggressive person. She gets into bad moods very very easily and always looks to argue. I told her again today I should see the eye doctor because last night I had easily the worst migraine I’ve ever had and I told her it was from a lot of reading and school work and I explained how it isn’t from stress it’s from eye strain from only using my right eye. 

Just for some background info:
I’ve had and needed glasses since I was 3 or 4. My right eye does need prescription but it’s not that bad that I need to wear glasses all day everyday which is why I suggest reading glasses. Since Covid my glasses have gone out of prescription. I havent asked for new glasses since maybe 8 months ago but my mom is aware my vision is not perfect at all. 

Anyway I told her today how bad my migraine was yesterday and how strained my eye is today. And I explained again how my eye gets strained from being overused and I need glasses to even be able to read clearly. Then she said “so it’s from general stress basically” this made me a bit frustrated as I had made sure to express my points very clear to her. And I’ve been telling her this for the last 8 months. I said “no it’s from eye strain did you forget what I just said?“ and maybe that wasn’t the right thing to say but I felt like she wasn’t listening or taking me serious. And frankly she hasn’t taken me serious for the last year and ignored my painful migraines and not called the eye doctor. She then got into a loud voice and was like “why are you trying to cause an argument” which is always her go to phrase when she doesn’t want to actually listen to me so I was like “I’m not? You just ignored everything I just explained” And then she tried to argue so I just said ok and walked off. Idk if I’m the asshole here but I’m just frustrated.

UPDATE:
So now she’s saying it’s only stress that’s causing my headaches. Not my eyes that have literally been medically proven to not be perfect. For gods sake I can’t even use one of my eyes at all. She said “you need to just accept that stress makes you have headaches even if you don’t feel stressed”…. What. I just didnt reply to her after saying that because I do not know how you respond to that.",info
"title: AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?
content: Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.

&#x200B;

the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.

&#x200B;

so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""

&#x200B;

I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.

&#x200B;

So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.

&#x200B;

My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.

AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?

TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?

Edit to add:

As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.

&#x200B;

Leut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission.",nta
"title: AITA friend is always late so we give her a earlier time, she actually showed up on time and is pissed
content: Our friend isabel is usually 1-2 hours late to anything we do because she unorganized and spends an excessive amount if time getting ready which she tries to do last minute. We got sick of waiting 1-2 hours every time we go out so wed started telling her to show up at 4 when we are actually meeting at 5:30. We did this like 3 times and she was usually like 10 minutes late still. 

Well here's the problem, we were meeting up last night, we told her 6:30 last night and we were actually meeting at around 7:45. She showed up 25 minutes early and is fucjing pissed that we did this, she found out we gave her wrong times intentionally. She says were assholes and she felt betrayed.

"title: AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year?
content: Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",yta
"title: AITA if I often don’t want to hug my anxious sister?
content: My sister struggles with her mental health. When she’s anxious I sit with her and ask what she needs, tell her I love her, make her food, bring her water, suggest she sit outside, etc. I do have a history of falling into a caretaker role.

The only thing that seems to truly calm her down is hugs and physical affection. I’m autistic and get touch aversion and sensory overload. So often times I’ll turn down her request for a hug. This makes her feel rejected and shut down further. 

Sometimes when I ask what she needs she gets frustrated and says “you know exactly what I need.” Referring to cuddles and hugs. If I don’t want touch in those moments I’ll get her my weighted blanket and weighted stuffed animal. Or suggest she call a friend. When I do hug her she clings to me and squeezes me and 1 hug opens the gates to more and more.

After about 1-3 hours of trying to help her, I walk away and tell her I’m going to give her some space. At times I just feel uncomfortable by that point. This also makes her feel rejected.

Recently she told me I’m a hypocrite because I will hug my boyfriend and he hugs me if I’m upset. I don’t know why it feels different to me, there are times I don’t want him touching me either but generally do show him physical affection. I also do hug my sister, 1-2 times a day when we greet each other or say bye. EVEN when I don’t want to. 

My friend says it’s 10 seconds of discomfort to help and it doesn’t make sense why I don’t just “suck it up” for her since “we all do things we don’t like for loved ones,” and “helping you isn’t fun either you know.” The same friend chastised me for walking away after 3 hours because my sister was still crying and shaking…  

After 2 years of me begging her she agreed to see a therapist I found for her but won’t schedule appointments unless I nag her or do it for her…

The main issue of tension is the hugs and what my friend said is on my mind… also, we’re both in our early 20s. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA if i told my friend not to take a drop for a better college
content: Me and let's say Sam have been friends for 2 years. We both gave JEE (entrance exam for college) and both of us could not secure a rank to get into the top colleges, right now we have option to join a tier 2 college. Sam recently asked me whether he should take a drop and try one more time and he told me he would be studying online at home, being friends for two years, Sam wasn't really into studying and would easily get distracted. He scored around 30-40 marks out of 300 this time and he would need 180+ marks to get into a top college. I gave my exam this year by studying online and never went to school for last two years whereas Sam had regular school.

When he told me he is taking a drop and would follow this strategy I told him not to do this and instead join the tier 2 he was getting and perform well in college. I told him about my experience on how it took me 2-3 months to get adjusted to no school routine and sometimes it would be pretty lonely. But that was okay, since i had 2 years to prepare.

If the same thing will happen to Sam, he cannot afford to lose 2-3 months since he would be getting only 8 months to prepare 2 years' worth syllabus.

When I told him all this, he was pretty pissed at me and called me an asshole for not having trust in him (I just wanted him not to waste an year) and sent me 2-3 videos of some youtubers who cracked the exam studying online, His only aim right now is to earn a good amount of money and the only reason he is not joining the tier 2 college is that there is a risk factor in how much money he would get in placements and his cousins got into those top colleges so their parents are taunting him.",nta
"title: AITA lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging
content: Asking for blunt honesty here because I can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if I've been an asshole and if so I'll go and apologise. 

I'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

This women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

Anyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

So for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

So a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)

""Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.""

I did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.

I can't deal with this nonsense and I'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",nta
"title: AITA my classmate ""saved goldfish"" by releasing them into the ocean, I called her a dumbass
content: My classmate recently made a tiktok and she showed a group of people at lunch time it. They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say ""hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out"" and in it she explains how she ""rescued"" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free. 

I was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said ""you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen"" her friend says ""well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?"" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her. 

They say that I'm a bully and walk away. I later get called into the principal's office who told me I was expected to apologize, and I said no, I stand by what I said.

"title: AITA or wanting my neighbors dogs not to use the yard?
content: I might be the asshole because dogs need a place to pee. I live in a 2 story condo. We are only two units. *We are the HOA. There is not higher HOA board for me to appeal to.* We share a VERY small yard. There are two dogs on the premises who use the yard to pee and poo. The yard is all concrete. The neighbors dont regularly was down the pee nor do they regularly use the enzyme to clean the yard. The urine soaks into the concrete and causes the yard to smell like piss. It is subtle, and the neighbors claim they do not smell it. This affects my current quality of life and if affects resale value. I have 2 people living with me and they both smell the urine. Previously, they didnt pick up after their dogs as much and after much asking nicely, I just started putting the feces on their doorstep after I stepped in it once at night. The feces issues has gotten better, but the yard still smells like urine. They might use the enzyme once a year, but I think they need to be using it one out of two of every pees, minimum. AITA for wanting the dogs not to use the shared concrete yard as their primary urine and defection space?

"title: AITA telling the truth in the wedding toast?
content: I'm a 30 year old male and my best friend got married last week.  I just bought a house and my wife is expecting out son in November, so I let him know I was limited in what I could contribute financially, but did tell him I would try my best.  So, I wend to the bachelor party in Maine, I rented the tux, and paid for mine and my wife's dinner at the rehearsal dinner.  I also had a gift of $300 that I was going to give them, but we will get to why I didn't give it to them.

His (now wife, then fiance) texted me multiple times a day with updates--fine.  I didn't always respond and it got to the point where if I didn't repsond at LEAST once a day, I'd get a call from my buddy.  (I have a full time job and am redoing some rooms in my house, so I'm busy.)  She texted me for the following reasons:

1.  My wife was NOT allowed to talk about our pregnancy, at all.  She didn't want anyone to focus on that more than her, the bride.
2. She was NOT going to order special food for my wife (no one asked her to, my wife was fine with whatever she was going to be served.)
3. I was not helping the groom enough, he had to help her with favors, seating charts and programs, so I had to help him with those things, according to her.  She also said to get ready to help with thank you notes after the wedding.
4. She said if I was a true best man, I would offer to pay for the bar bill.  I don't even know what that means.
5. She had to read a approve my speech before the rehearsal dinner and wanted to be include as much, as my buddy.  She told me to make up things if I had to.  I was also NOT allowed to include anyone but the two of them and no inside jokes or stories about my buddy that didn't include her.
6. Her last text said to tell my wife to keep it together and not make a pregnancy scene during the wedding. Also, she wanted her to choose a dress that downplayed her pregnancy as much as possible.

I was just so aggravated, I spoke to my friend to see if he could reason with her.  He told me to just play ball on this one, it's her day and to cut him a break, because he'd be dealing with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I was annoyed but calmed down.

The day of, all the bride and my buddy do is scold me, berate me and bark orders.  I head down to the bar for the a drink...the bride's mother is there and warns me not to get drunk because I've ruined her daughter's day enough.  Final straw.

I didn't give them the card with the cash and in the speech, I used my friend's exact wording about having to deal with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I wished them the best and told him I'd always be there for him, especially during the divorce.  AITA?",info

I confronted my dad and offered to take another dog, he told me no. Once again without an explanation, I asked him why can't we just put him in the crate. He said he doesn't want him up all night. I tend to put him in his crate either way once he wakes me up. So, AITA here?",info
"title: AITA- asked to babysit and I want it to be at my house
content: My sister asked me to babysit my niece who is 16 while she is on a cruise. Last summer my niece traveled with my mother and I on a road trip, and when we got back to my house my niece called her mother to tell her what a filthy dump my house is and to come get her. Granted I’m not that into house cleaning, but I’m not a hoarder or anything I have 6 dogs and there is frequently dog hair and mud on the floor. 
So now she needs a sitter but she wants me to stay at her house. I am traveling the week before and would like to stay at my home since I don’t get paid for this. I have things I need to do at home. I have a feeling if I say anything I will be accused of ruining her vacation :(",nta
"title: AITA...For telling my wife ""I warned you"" when our son got a lock for his room?
content: So here's the problem, My son Simon (16) moved out of the room he used to share with his little brother and got his own room a few months back. Eversince, he's been complaining about his mom barging in without knocking and interrupting his sleep and studying. Sometimes when he's changing...I know that she's his mother but he says he's got his own room and has a job and is learning to become an independent adult but
doesn't feel like his privacy is being respected even when that's his mom. He says he's not a kid anymore and is entitled to at least get a knock on the door before she comes in.

He was getting tired of her not listening to him 
So he came to me and said ...dad, you need to help me set some clear boundaries with mom. So I spoke to her about her need to knock before entering Simon's room. She was like what? And no, we're family, not strangers...do you really expect me to foolishly knock on the door 5 times a day?...that's ridiculous!!! Also the...""who knocks doors in their own home?"". I told her my family for instance.
She made a face then went on a rant about how my family hate each others and the way they treat each others like they were strangers is shameful.
I told her family or strangers it's about respecting one's privacy. We had an argument about it and
I told her if she wasn't going to stop with the barging and refuse to knock on the door before entering then our son will get a lock.

She did it again at 11pm, she barged in when our son was asleep he jumped up because he got scared.
Once he told me this I told him to go ahead and get a lock and pay for it with his own money, there was literally no other way.

My wife saw it and got upset and my brother was visiting when she was raising her voice at me
questioning if *I* really went ahead and got a lock for Simon despite her disapproval and said that I caught her off guard and it's not okay because this teaches our children that they can 'manipulate' one parent into doing what they want. I told her that A. Simon got the lock not me and B. I already warned her about the possibility of him getting a lock because he was getting tired of her boundary crossing. So she should've expected this outcome.

She mentioned the same above points in her defense and said locks means secrets and that's not good. My brother was sitting watching while she was complaining, She began chewing him out when he asked her to let simon keep the lock and said it wasn't a big deal.
She stopped talking to me and Simon til we remove the lock but I've no intentions on doing that.

"title: AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?
content: I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

So this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",nta
"title: AITA: Mothern in law wants to move our wedding date. I'm furious.
content: My fiancé and I provisionally settled on a venue, date and budget for our wedding we are both ok with after a lot of weighing up options. We booked a midweek wedding at a nice venue. 

Today my mother in law (to be) dropped round and said the midweek date was no good. Her sister and sisters husband would find it too difficult to make the wedding. She wants it on a Saturday and will pay the difference.

When I explained it would be almost twice the price on the weekend, she was quite surprised, but insisted it had to be on the weekend. 

We are also having a separate event in her sisters city for people who can't make it (it's a 5 hour flight away) 

My fiancés mother also doesn't have the money to comfortably afford to spend on this. Her husband is unhappy with delaying his retirement to pay for renovations to their home and she has also borrowed from a friend to fund her spending previously. 

For those reasons it doesn't feel right to shift the date and accept the money. 

I also don't like her repeatedly making statements like ""you have to understand, a scrooge pays twice"" and "" it's like buying a Ryanair ticket, you end up paying more"" 

My fiancé insists that her mother is only offering help and I am unreasonably taking offense at her statements, which are due to cultural misunderstandings.

Am I being oversensitive? I am trying to stay calm, but absolutely incandescent with rage and quite close to making some quite rash decisions I'll probably regret. 

I think she's offering money she doesn't have to make decisions that aren't hers to make.",nta
"title: AITA: Told my parents I can't take my sister from foster care for 2 months
content: I 22F have a younger sister, 18F, who's aging out of foster care. I had the luck of being adopted, whereas she did not. She had an arrangement to stay with her foster parent, though to my knowledge the foster parent suddenly changed her mind despite charging her money to stay there right now.

She's set to need somewhere to go by August, but my Lease ends in November. I currently have a 25F roommate who isn't comfortable living in our 2 bedroom apartment with someone she's never met. My parents, who have 2 guest bedrooms, keep insisting that I need to entirely disregard my roommates opinion, despite her being on the lease and paying her share of rent every month, that I simply have to tell her my sister IS coming and she has NO say.

My roommate and I have already considered other options; sorting out a new apartment and have it ready by August. This isn't feasible because she cant be on two leases, I can't afford this one alone, and my little sister will need several months to become financially stable enough to pay bills like rent. I am physically unable to carry her financial weight.

We are willing to get separate leases come November, where I can then take in my sister granted my parents are willing to step in if she doesn't have the money - because again, I am not in a position where I can keep her afloat, but I have been insistent that it can't happen until then. As a result, my parents are calling me selfish and telling me that I'm choosing my friend over my sister, who desperately needs my help.

I am frustrated because if they are that upset about it, they can spare a bedroom - afterall they are the one making the demand that I have to take her - that's what makes sense to me.

Regardless, AITA?  


Edit: A lot of people have asked so I'm just going to put it here for context - the parents in question are my adopted parents. Our biological parents are dead. The only reason we ended up split up in the foster care system was because the state made a mistake only removing me from the home before our bio parents died and by the time they realized this the bio parents had fled the state with my siblings. They died \~ 8 years later, which is when my siblings ended up in foster care. Not to mention - until I found them and made contact, the state they were in didn't even know I existed.",info

After hearing this, i mentioned that i have also plans to let her know that i also having a celebration. Now she is mad that i did not tell her earlier, and she might have joined if i let her know a bit before. But she promised her mom she would come to her family gathering ( 5 hours away from me). However, she makes plans without asking me about it either, i do want her to come to my celebration if she was free. She has never asked what my plans for this years celebration were either.

Context: my husband (m34) and I (f26) got married 9 months ago, we live in a different town from his parents, and his mom visited us unexpectedly on friday. 

Now to give some context about my MIL, She is okay-ish but has no respect for her son's privacy and by extension, mine. 

When it was time to go to bed, MIL requested that we let her sleep in the bedroom, on the master bed, not just that but lock the door as well because she explained she can't feel comfortable enough to sleep without locking the door. I found this bizzare but I politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. My husband agreed but I said no. This initiated an argument between her and I. During the argument I pointed put how I didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying ""Don't you just stand there! Say something!"". My husband told me to let her it's just one night, but I told her those were all the options I had for her and if she didn't like them then I could book her in a hotel. She took it as in I was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. 

She left at 12am and my husband blew up saying I disrespected his mom who was a GUEST at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and I acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off.

"title: AITA? Husband threw a BBQ party for his friends. I refused to help. Party was a disaster.
content: Disclaimer: we are all vaccinated.


So, my husband likes to invite his friends (note: HIS friends. I am not close with them) for barbecue parties. He prides himself on his BBQ skills. The thing is... I always end up doing everything! He buys and preps the meat and then grills and serves it (and collects praise for his BBQ skills). I have to buy drinks, get out enough dishes, clean up the patio/deck (non native speaker, idk which one to use). I prepare the sides and veggies, I refill the drinks and take away dishes (we don’t use paper plates or plastic cups since I find it wasteful) so as to keep the main table tidy. It’s just nonstop work for me. 


He just told me last week that he invited his friends for Saturday (so yesterday). Just announced it, didn’t ask me. I said well okay, do I know anyone? Nope, those are his work mates and they won’t be bringing their spouses. My husband called it a “guys’ night”. I said okay then, guys’ night, well enjoy yourselves, I will be in my craft room working on some of my projects and drinking wine. He said he will handle it.


Spoiler alert, he did not handle it. He got the meat alright, but just ignored any other preparation and I was just so sick and tired of being taken for granted (he never -asks- me for help, I just do stuff...) so I didn’t do anything. The patio was a mess, the upholstery of the garden furniture was all messy from our dogs, the table wasn’t wiped down, there was stuff lying all around. His friends arrived, I welcomed them and then excused myself to my crafts room, put some music on and worked. Cue the messages.


He started asking for stuff, like where are the plates (we only keep a small set in the kitchen, the rest is in the basement), where are the cups, why isn’t the beer chilled, where is the non alcoholic beer - did I not buy it? Where are the sides? I just replied that he said he would handle it all himself.  (EDIT: this is also where I fee I might have been the asshole, it would have taken me just minutes to at least tell him where the stuff is)


I checked on the guys a few hours later and it was a disaster. Table all cluttered, they ordered some takeout as sides, there weren’t enough dishes and silverware, someone had to go drive for drinks. 


On Sunday (today) he was all grumpy and actually told me that he is disappointed that I didn’t pull my weight and that I made our family look sloppy and bad. I told him that I am not his little housewife and that he is a big guy and if he embarrassed himself in front of his work mates, that’s all on him. And that I’m glad that he can see at least a tiny bit of work that I do around the house. He got upset and went for a run to let off some steam. 


Oh and the patio is full of dishes, he didn’t even clean the grill. I’m not touching anything.

Edit/update: thank you for the comments, this made me realize I am at fault as well - for tolerating this for so long. I went out to clear my head (my husband came back from his run and is pointedly not speaking to me) and reconsider many things in our marriage.

Edit/update2: maybe a similar story was posted before, apparently more husbands are assholes. Feel free to post the link to the supposedly identical post I copied this from, go ahead.

"title: AITA? I called my brother selfish for not wanting to attend our dad's funeral
content: Obligatory things first, I’m not a native english speaker and have never posted on here before. If there are any mistakes please let me know.

My (20f) father passed away last week. It was very sudden and unexpected at 44 years old. I think I still haven’t fully realized it yet. His funeral will be next weekend. My siblings and I have been making arrangements in our group chat. It’s been mostly my sister (23f) and me planning the burial as well as how we’d clean out his flat. Our brother (25m) hasn’t involved himself apart from listing the things he wants to take from the flat. Since there is no will, we decided to split everything between the 3 of us.

We were on a video call this morning and were discussing decorations etc and where to host the funeral meal after the church. My brother then said he didn’t care what we chose because he wouldn’t attend anyway. My sister looked shocked and I told him he didn’t really mean that. We had a fight. I called him selfish and disrespectful for not wanting to go. He said he only wanted to get the things he still had at our dad’s place and that he won’t pretend like he was a good father just because he was dead. Then he hung up.

My sister agrees that he’s acting really selfish but thinks he might still come around if we give him time. My brother and father always had a rocky relationship but we’re still a family and should be there for each other.

My boyfriend said I should apologize and accept my brother’s choice. I just think he’s being disrespectful to the person who raised us. I know he wasn’t perfect but he did his best and this behavior is very childish.




Edit: 

First off, thank you all for commenting. I've seen a few people mention the relationship between my dad and brother. When I described it as ""rocky"" I did simplify it. My dad was 19 and my brother's mom was 17 when they had my brother. She didn't want a child so our dad became a single parent. Considering his age and lack of a support system my dad did make mistakes that he admitted to and also said he regretted. 

My brother and dad are very much alike. They're both headstrong and can be a little short tempered when things don't work out as planned. That wasn't a good mix during my brother's teenage years. They had a lot of fights back then. Eventually my brother moved out soon after turning 16 and from what I know they've had semi-regular contact about once or twice a month.
I don't know the full story, of course, as I was 10 years old when he moved out. 

I hope this makes sense, I tried to put in all the information that I thought might be relevant. I have texted my brother an apology which he hasn't read yet. I also asked him if we could talk because I would like to hear his side of things. As many of you have pointed out, there might be more to their relationship that I'm not aware of.

"title: AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.
content: My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.

His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.

When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",nta
"title: AITA? My mom is an influencer. I am sick of being a part of it, I had ""NO PHOTOS"" hoodies printed for me and my little sister.
content: I am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. 

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.

I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.

""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking

But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.

And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. 

I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.

I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree

"title: AITA? Suing my neighbor after she sprayed weedicide on my lawn
content: Caught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said “she was sick of all the weeds” and thought she was doing me a solid.

1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees

2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.

So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.

Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) 

So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.

I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. 

She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills

Edit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before

I don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of

Her: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” 

Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” 

Her: “Something about my new car.”

The end

Since she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sprouting

Edit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.

Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick”

Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.

UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. 

My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready 

For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.

Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. 

And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.

Please in the future; avoid messaging me for updates 

I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that’s just beyond rude STOP IT. Im allowed to make other posts without being reminded of this; you’ll get updates as they come and as I please not as you demand. Thank you.",nta

"title: AITAH for calling someone a C*** when they were in the wrong and carried on the situation.
content: My Wife believes I’m the A-Hole 
But other members in our circle don’t. 

It kicked off in my kids sports group. 
This Person Trevor we shall call him. Decided to have a go at the groups coaches. Who hadn’t done or said anything wrong other than having to change the training for the week, due to family emergency. 
(First time they have ever changed training. This coach even turned up 2 hours after his wife gave birth when he didn’t need too.) 

Trevor kicked off and told them they were selfish and told no wonder the boys were struggling to win a game and that his child was being let down by team mates and coaches. (He implied that his child was the best. The comment was no read very well between all the parents who wasn’t happy he was slamming other people’s children down. His child isn’t anything special and all though he is good he’s not better than the rest of them. They are all equal and I said this to him.) 

He was told that training was still going ahead just different day if doable. Whilst also being reminded by the coaches assistant that they did this voluntary. 
One of the coaches comes straight to practice from work and heads to work straight after games. 
After all was done he told them he was removing his kid from the team and wanted to complain. The coaches said this was fine if he felt the need to complain and gave him the number to complain to and then removed him from the group.

After two hours of being removed Trevor than messaged me. 
Telling me I was in the wrong for slamming his son saying he wasn’t good at all which was not what was said. 
I tried my best replying back diplomatically even saying what’s he’s accusing me of he did the same about the other boys slamming there ability implying his boy was the best, it didn’t work buttons were pushed and after some time of too and throwing I called him a hypocritical c*** and told him how he shouldn’t of messaged me if he didn’t like the responses he was getting. 

It gets a little awkward now as, our youngest kids go to the same day care as each other and after a while my wife made me apologise to him. If anything  for the kids. Although reluctant I did because I shouldn’t of called it him and kids shouldn’t be burden to two adults mistakes.

I still stand by my original comments but the name calling and apologised for that and told him what’s done is done and asked to be civil as our kids are friends at the end of the day. I may have said what I said but I made a mistake and willing to let bygones be bygones.

After the apology a few days later, I was approached by the coach with the complaint and notified Trevor had tried to get my boy kicked from the team. 
I’ve had to go through a process and was told to apologise. I told them I already had done before any of this and kept all messages to send forward in case they needed them. 

I was also told by the coach not to worry as Trevor has come out of no where with his complaint and the club haven’t taken it seriously as 24 hours before ranting and being rude to the coaches and parents of the team. He was actually praising them and sharing on social how he was happy his boy had made good friends and his coaches were amazing. They couldn’t understand what made him turn. 
After two more days I was approached again and Trevor had now gone to some other coach about the situation some one bigger in the club. 
I assume this was after not getting results he wanted.

I believe as do others, say it wouldn’t have got to  that point had Trevor not of contacted me privately 2 hours after being booted and everything was done. 
In my eyes he started to harass and gaslight me. To which wouldn’t of escalated in the first place had he of not got in touch with me in the first place and just left it.",yta

content: AITAH for refusing to travel to improve our finances

English is my second language so please forgive me if u see any errors🙏.
I 36F was asked by my husband 38M
to seek a job in another country to improve our financial situation because my job is requested more than his job.
But that entail me going there alone with the kids ,we have two and me working and taking care of the kids and he visiting us frequently. 
I refused because 
1- our finances are not that bad we have a house  and a car and some savings 
2- his oprtionty is not that good to find a job. 
3- one of my kids has autism and the move will be hard on him
4- I actually don't want to handle all the responsibilities alone 
How is that being married? 
I am sure that will breed contempt and frustration and will eventually break our marriage 
His reasons 
1- we have kids with disabilities autism and ADHD and we need to save for their future 
2- we pay very expensive private school fees to accommodate our kids
3-his job is not that stable, and he might be laid off (he always had this fear in every job since we married 12 years ago)
3-to him, this is the only way for us to have savings 
4- he took a job in another country after refusing for a while but was laid off due to the pandemic and now is my turn( he went alone and I stayed to take care of the kids while working and getting my master degree but I also got support from my family at that time)
 he thinks I am lazy and don't want to work hard because  I chose my job here to  have a flexible hours to allow me to be there for my kids but of course that come with less income 
He said I should at least try.
So AITAH?
Should I give it a try?",nta
"title: Aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior
content: I'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. 

To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

She said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

I said she was absolutely right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. 

I have never seen someone storm off so mad. 

Quick edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. ",nta
"title: Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?
content: My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”.",nta
"title: Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?
content: 
This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",nta
"title: META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world
content: I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",nta
"title: So we decided to fuck with the sub.
content: # Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",yta
"title: UPDATE AITA for asking my roommate to spend the night at her boyfriends place?
content: Thanks everyone for saying that I was not the asshole in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139xh5j/update_aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_spend_time/). 

There's a small update to the situation. After I posted my original question, I spent a few days at my ex's place because my only other friend that knows this situation also thinks I'm being unfair.

My roommate finally paid me the five months of utilities that she owed me, which is a start. I did try to open a dialogue with her but she really stood strong in bringing over her boyfriend because ""they rarely get so much time together since he's in school"" and that if he had less roommates maybe it would be different. I tried to tell her that from my side, nearly all week is so little time. When they got together months ago she had said that she wanted to make sure she balanced her friend life and girlfriend life, which she's not but whatever.

A few people said to look into getting my own place, but with the area I live in it's kind of impossible. My only option outside of her would be moving back home and that's the absolute worst thing that can happen. Also, because her boyfriend doesn't have a car and takes up parking space, there's no real hard rule in our lease.

We are looking in to finding another place when our lease is up with another roommate so I can only cross my fingers that they additional roommate will add a level of buffering between us.

Also, despite this issue, I do want to say that she is my best friend. We've known each other throughout our undergrad and have helped each other with a lot. Her mom even let me move in with them during COVID when my home life became unliveable. Which is one of the reasons why I feel like I owe her so much.",nta
"title: UPDATE Am I the asshole for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress insetad of giving it to my sister who can't afford it?
content: Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/erfvwt/aita_for_cutting_up_and_altering_my_wedding_dress/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I posted approximately 5 months ago about my sister being mad at me for not giving her, what was supposed to be, my wedding dress.

So after being assured that I did nothing wrong I decided to try to talk it out with my sister. So I tried calling her but she had blocked my number. I was very Confused and talked to my mother. She was trying to still stay out of it and I got a little mad and said that it was not fair. That my sister was not right because she never formally asked me and how was I supposed to just guess that she wanted it. She tried to justify her but in the end also accepted that my sister was wrong. Non the less she told me to just give her space and that she will just come to terms with it herself.

I waited a few days till I met her in the supermarket. At first she tried to act like she didn't see me but I planted myself infront of her. She was just rolling her eyes saying she had places to be. And I just said ""you know I hope you notice how unfair you are treating me"" and then left her alone.

That night I received a call where I was berated for being selfish for about 20 minutes by her. I asked her if she was done and asked her if we could talk it out like adults. She came over the next night and we had an exhausting fight. Screaming crying and after all was said and done she actually apologized for everything. She was kind of jealous of my dress and of the wedding I almost had. And she was embarassed that she couldn't afford everything I could and that she felt like she failed as an adult and as a mother. And honestly I get it. Not because I think she is a failure, but because I get how it feels if your brain tells you you failed at life because you don't have things that other people have. She apologized also because she was trying to blame me for her problems and that everything was easier if she wasn't the one to blame. We talked a lot more time till I told her that she didn't need a fancy dress and that we could search something basic and I could help her to decorate it with something. She agreed and we actually did get to customize a very basic gown. As we didn't have much time it's not super fancy. Sadly due to the outbreak the wedding, that was supposed to happen this month, was canceled. They had a courthouse wedding where she wore one of my dresses and she is celebrating in August if it's possible.

That's everything. So even if I was not an asshole and my sister seemed like a brat... She was dealing with some heavy feelings and I still love her. 

Thanks for the judgment and advice.",info
"title: UPDATE ~ AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before
content:  It has been a little under 2 months and I have received quite a few requests to make an update over the past 9 or so weeks, looking at you SnooChipmunks3950 , at first I was going to make one a week or 3 ago but I decided against it and instead chose to wait till I had some proper updates, but well, here goes.

Previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita\_for\_walking\_out\_on\_a\_double\_date\_my\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita_for_walking_out_on_a_double_date_my_friend/)

At any rate like I said, here goes. It turns out that some of the more pessimistic of you were right, Jane was being obsessive and stalkerish and it sort of all came tumbling down on her at that point. A week or so after I made my post she decided to message me, well it came down to her not understanding why I was showing interest in her and then refused to date her(I never showed interest in her beyond basic friendliness.), A wall of text dedicated to thrashing my previous relationships and calling them all sorts of names, specifically pointing out how I dated the ""Wrong girls"" and a weird rant about how everyone agreed me and her were meant to be, which just isn't the case, like I said in my previous post, there is a running joke in our friend group about how weird she is.

Now, you might think this is something that can be expected, something that just happens, an outlet for her of sorts, except, she send it from the wrong account. See, I had become internet friends with a person In the past month or two, me and her would game together, chat from time to time, you know, the usual organic internet friend situation. And the messages concerning out ""Date"" were sent from this account, turns out she had literally used this alias to infiltrate my ""internet"" friend group and keep tabs on me of sorts? Obviously this freaked me the fuck out, I took screenshots of what she had sent me and afterwards blocked all accounts that I knew now she was using.

I followed that up by sharing everything in our friend discord and in our friend whatsapp group, so everyone could see which resulted in her being kicked from both and I later got a call from Joe full on apologetic, telling me he had no idea and he knew he shouldn't have done it but that his girlfriend was being pressured by Jane, turned out, Jane had literally been bitching at her for months to arrange something like this and she finally caved, again creepy stuff, I told him that I needed some time as he really fucked me over bigtime and I didn't trust him anymore as a result.

While Jane has been shunned by all friends, she still contacted me twice, once to apologize which quickly turned into weird shit where she started talking about ""Us"" she seems convinced there is an us and I am interested and another time just to curse at me, both from random accounts. I am not sure where to go from here and I am still pretty shook up.",info
"title: UPDATE: A month ago I was told I WBTA for not telling a date about my plans to be a single mother, so I told him
content: Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta\_by\_not\_telling\_a\_guy\_ive\_been\_dating\_for\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta_by_not_telling_a_guy_ive_been_dating_for_a/)

A month ago I asked if I WBTA for not telling a guy I had only started dating that I had plans to become a single mother. I was scared I'd lose him but also felt I would be deceiving him by not telling him, thus making the investment in our relationship unfair. The comments were pretty much unanimous in that I'm an asshole, and I needed to tell him, and this validated my decision to go forth and be honest, as nervous as I was.

I explained my situation about taking 2 yrs to come to this decision, how my fertility clinic had shut due to Covid which was why I had gone back onto dating apps. I explained how my clinic had reopened after meeting him, and how important it was to me to continue in my journey to become a mother. I knew this was 'baggage' he hadn't expected and that there was every chance he would step away from the situation. Well, he didn't.

We're now in a committed relationship and he's been supporting me in my journey. I've had 2 unsuccessful artificial inseminations with donor sperm (my original plan), and we've spoken about having a child together. As early on as it may seem, he told me my honesty made him consider his own future and how he really wants a family some day, and how he has admiration for me being honest about my situation and how he wants to help my fulfil my desires to be a mother, whether with him or with donor sperm - either way he wants to be a part of my life.

I wanted to provide this update as a positive outcome has come out of being labelled an asshole and it pushed me to do the right thing, which has in turn meant I have the most understanding and accepting bf. Had I kept this info from him it would have played on my conscience, as well as most likely have caused him to not trust me. So thank you : )  


EDIT - Gosh, I didn't think this post would blow up in this way. Thanks for the lovely words of support, and also those of you taking the time to provide food for thought of co-parenting and step-parenting. This is new territory for me, and I don't know anyone else in my day to day life who has been in this situation, so it's so valuable for me to hear your views and gain new perspectives. Thank you, kind Reddit community.",nah
"title: UPDATE: AITA for Trying to Send my Deaf Daughter to a School that Won't Hire an Interpreter?
content: Thank you all for your advice on my last post. I wasn't aware of all the laws about this kinda thing. For those of you who didn't read the OP basically my 6YO daughter is deaf and communicates using ASL. There is a public school near us but it's very bad and the whole district has a rating of 1.5/5 stars. All of our other children go to a private school near us. But the private school said they wouldn't pay for an interpreter because there is a deaf school in our county, but the deaf school only teaches speech and no sign language so we decided not to send her there. We also wanted her to go to the private school because there was a language option for ASL so she may be able to communicate with other classmates. But my brother said that we shouldn't push trying to get her in, if the school doesn't want her we should just give up.

Most people said to hire a lawyer. My husband decided to contact his brother who is a disability lawyer, although he specializes in wheelchair accessibility he was willing to take our case. We discussed the situation over the phone with him and then he reached out to the private school.

He emailed back and forth with the school. We're not sure what was said exactly but by the end of it, not only did the school agree to pay for the interpreter but they also provided a free scholarship and let us request which teacher she had which they didn't let us do for any of our other kids. There is a kindergarten teacher who knows some ASL so we chose to be in her class. I'm not sure exactly why they did this but I think it's probably because denying entry to a kindergartener just because she's deaf would not look so good if other people found out. But I'm not complaining.

She started 2 weeks ago and she loves it(They are doing hybrid) she is able to make friends and talk to other kids(Though in kinda broken sign language). Her interpreter is very nice and will update us on how she did everyday unlike the interpreter she had when she was in public school. Her teacher also tried to sign when she's speaking as much as possible and so do some of the kids. Overall I'm so happy this happened and I wouldn't have known there was anything I could do about it until I asked on here, so thank all of you who replied to the OP and told me they do have to provide an interpreter for her.

Edit: My pronouns are She/Her, I'm not sure why everyones referring to me as a male but just wanted to let you all know.

Edit 2: To everyone concerned as to why my BIL is a disability lawyer but I came to reddit first: We barely talk to BIL. He's my husbands half-brother and there is a 16 year age gap so they aren't close. And at the time when I first posted I didn't think I could do anything legally(I talked about why in the comments) so I didn't even think of talking to my BIL. I was just concerned if I was being too pushy which is why I came to this sub rather than legal advice. Hope that clears some things up.",nta

Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. “I’m starving, what do you want Maddie?” “Hi Starving, I’m not your daughter”. She had this biggest smirk on her face.

I listened to a lot of your feedback and talked to my BF after my post. He seemed weird in our talk. (He's been weird a lot lately, but I have been excusing it.) He told me that he said to put him on as an insurance beneficiary partially as a joke but then when I ""went off"" on my tangent (including offering up that he'll never go on my house title either even though he never mentioned it) that he got offended and reacted poorly. He said he really did think I was going off about all that in retaliation for his ""no to marriage"" talks so he was left with a bitter taste. Which...I get. I can be more forceful than I realize and I am naturally passive aggressive. He said I didn't have to put him on anything but he needs me to understand that I am it for him. He wants to makes his life with me. Things seemed to be better after this.

That weekend he asked if I wanted to go on a hike. It was peak season for the leaves changing and there is this waterfall he suggested we go to. We get to the waterfall and he pulls an envelope out of his jacket with a tiny bow on it and says it's a present for me. I open it and it's a receipt from a jewelry store. I was confused but I see he had the date of purchase highlighted and circled with a heart - it was early August (before the talks we had where he said he never wanted to get married). I turn and there he is with a ring. I said yes.

He said he knew I would never believe that he had the ring before all this without the receipt. That his attitude and comments when I started asking about marriage was to fool me so I didn't get suspicious because this was the plan all along - he wanted an autumn proposal in a beautiful location since it's my favorite season.

Money he has been saving after moving in with me (since I charge him a much smaller amount than he was previously paying) went to the ring. He saved money for over a year because he knew when he moved in with me that he was going to eventually ask me to marry him.

So honestly this is the best case scenario! We talked after too. When we get married we will add each other as beneficiaries on our insurance policies. And we decided there's no need to put him on my title even after we get married.

I really appreciate everyone's comments on that last post! I read all of them and most people were genuinely concerned and offered wonderful advice and support.",info
"title: UPDATE: Aita if I tell my friend her bf is planning to propose?

To everyone who told me to keep my mouth shut, thank you.

So on Saturday, the day of the proposal, I got a call from her boyfriend. He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren’t there… I was fucking slack jawed. 

I told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM “you just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.”

I was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read “welcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)” and this is where things go down hill. 

I did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn’t want to change her last name, and she’s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She’s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she’s doubled down.

When she saw the sign she joked “Mrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!” Everyone went silent until his mom said “Well the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!” She takes the ring off and see’s “Mrs.(his last name)” engraved on the band.

Then she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn’t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said “This was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.”

SHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That’s when I’m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).

She was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said “does he really think I’m that shallow?” She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. 

She’s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you’ve all helped me realize, this isn’t about me, it’s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.

Edit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn’t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.

EDIT 2 (update): I did not mention this plan when I originally posted just in case her ex found this thread, but I can report now that we got a heads up last night that he wasn’t at their apartment, so we ran over and got most of her shit out, at least all the really important stuff. To those asking, no she isn’t going back to him, it’s over.",nta
"title: UPDATE: WIBTA for reporting a coworker for feeding me?
content: Original: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/krodkm/wibta_for_reporting_a_coworker_to_hr_for_trying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Further detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/0587throwaway/comments/ktb7u0/peg_comments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 
Honestly, I’ve never more immediately regretted something. This exploded. Spectacularly. 

I went to HR, saying that the matter was settled, but I wanted it documented; subsequently was told that there would be an investigation and the incidents would be corroborated with witnesses, because as is the full record I claim is “severe enough to warrant potential action” for Pey and several other coworkers who also engaged in her behavior. HR started the process, apparently immediately, because I walked in yesterday to a shitstorm. 

This plunged the department into civil war. Many agree Peg was out of line, some told me I should’ve kept the status quo, some said I was ungrateful and entitled. One said I should have handled this “maturely” and “who could blame her” when I look “like that”, and I should be ashamed of myself. Another coworker suggested I work from home. Another told me he was sorry for not stepping in. I went to go get my lunch out of the fridge only to find someone had disposed of it and left behind the empty Tupperware. Nearly everyone has an opinion. The people in my corner have advised me to keep my head down and to take care. 

My boss held a meeting, first with Peg and me, then a second with just me. During the one with Peg, I was told to apologize for my part and Peg likewise. (“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable by caring about your health.”). My boss asked if I was “satisfied now”. I brought up Peg’s comments and my boss said I invited them, no one would call that harassment, and I need to work on myself. Together we went through each of the 23 events. She excused each of them until I was left to feel like I‘d been harassing Peg.

The next meeting was even worse. Effectively Boss said, “I told you not to retaliate and instead you searched Peg out to harass her” and “your actions have expressed a worrying lack of cooperation with me and your team.” She was also disappointed that instead of explaining that I needed her to resolve things, I “escalated the situation well beyond the point of reason” and cruel to someone who only wanted to help. She said I won’t get far in life and I’m not likely to get anywhere vocationally if I can’t be a team player and “actively sabotage a happy workplace”. She hoped I will learn from this “teachable moment” how to behave in a collaborative environment as it’s inappropriate to involve HR for “small misunderstandings”. 

BF is spitting mad. I’m just... tired, confused and hurt. HR seemed sympathetic. Boss is very clearly on Peg’s side. The office is split and tense. Currently updating my resume and job searching. It really does feel like a nightmare. Haven’t felt good going in to work for a while, and this just made it times worse.",nta
"title: Update: AITA for explaining gay people to a 5 years old?
content: This is a little update on my original post and I want to thank everyone, even the ones who were mean to me, because it helped me to think about my next steps on this mess.

The same week I wrote this post, my mom asked me to go to her house to talk and told me that she was talking with my sister about her and her husband actions. My mother asked me to try to conciliate with my sister because it was the best for both of us. 
I had mixed feelings about it and we decided to have a family lunch with me, my sister and my mom at my parent’s place on the following Saturday. 
The outcome wasn’t good at all. My sister was mean to me and said that I tried to play my parents against her and her husband. My mother was very upset of how my sister was acting and they had a fight. Things were worst after that with my mother saying she doesn’t recognise my sister anymore.

Things went really south because my father’s birthday was 15/04, it was his 60’s celebration and we planned that for months. My father called my sister and said that she and her stepdaughter were invited, but her husband wasn’t, she was upset and outraged and said that if her husband couldn’t go, she wouldn’t go either, and my father said “then don’t come”. 

A whole lot of drama. My sister sent me an angry email saying that from that moment on she didn’t want any contact with me and that I don’t need to expect forgiveness from her in the future when I am lonely because gay people ends lonely. She blocked me on social media and her contact with my parents is almost none at this point.",nta

Some stuff has happened recently and many of you have wanted an update on this. Appreciate the reassurance and understanding my decision when seems that many in this situation didn’t. I remained firm in my decision about not letting them use my property for their wedding. Even if they changed their mind about inviting us which honestly I don’t care about anymore. 
Rick’s family (thanks to him) got a hold of my cell so that was more people I had to deal with. I put my foot down with Rick a few days ago and told him directly that I will go to the police and press charges for harassment (I have all the texts and calls documented). Also had a very long talk with Carla about everything going on. She apologized for it all. And she knows it’s her own fault. 

Well she decided to be the one to call things off in the end. Some of my friends still seem to think it’s my fault and I’m taking some distance from them for a while. And also from Carla after getting some confirmation on a few things that I needed to know. Whole thing is a mess. I’m only glad in the end that I didn’t give in to their demands and the constant bugging has stopped.. It still was a huge headache over the last few days and not the kind of drama I want back in my life. Thank you to everyone who made me feel supported in this. It helped a lot not feeling like the only other person (aside from my wife), who thought their demand was insane and inappropriate.",info
"title: WIBTA - If I told my friend to go to the place she wants to go alone?
content: I (25F) feel a bit down - I always do whatever my friend (24F) wants to do, even if I’m not a fan. Because I like to take interest and learn what my friend likes and dislikes. 

Anyway, me and my friend are going back to a country I grew up in. It’s her first time going, and I’m very excited to show her where I grew up.

She gave me a list of places she wants to go, and tbh I don’t really want to go there, and she can do all this by herself. But she wants me to come and asked if I would. I decided I will go with her, because it’s what she wants to do and she’s my friend.

I also want to do something that I like too, and I asked if she wants to come join as well. 

She said she doesn’t.

It upsets me a bit, because I do everything she wants to do. But she never interested in what I want to do.

So WIBTA if I told her to go alone to place she wants to go, and I’ll go to the place I want to go, and we just meet up later for lunch?",info
"title: WIBTA For Trying to Get A Coworker Fired
content: I've been working at my retail job for a few years and I love it. It was my first job and  it's very chill

However, late last year we hired a white 18M named Chad. 

Chad is an obnoxious, privileged self-righteous AH. 

He has issues with me and idk why

 He made a lot of sexual, sexist, or just inappropriate comments in general but to me specifically, he would always try to tell me inappropriate race jokes (I'm black). When a lot of my coworkers made a list of our complaints, I held that back because I didn't want to get him fired and I'm the only POC at my job, raising those complaints are just uncomfortable.

As well, he started making a lot of 'joking"" put downs towards me. Saying he does a better job than me, faster than me, trying to nag me for things that he's even worse at. A heavy emphasis on ""laziness"" which honestly feels racial. Then it went from ""jokes"" to shade, mainly about my position and my pay. While Chad is the average cashier, I'm technically a level above him because I'm certified to do other roles on the job, unfortunately Covid has limited my ability to do so but I still get my pay bump. ""It's not fair that you get paid more than me"" ""you should only get paid for when you do xyz"" ""I think they need take your position away"" Those things would bother me for days

Last week Chad and I got put on the same shift. The store manager on duty told me there was basically nothing for me to do once Chad got there and to just focus on a specific computer course that Corporate has been urging everyone to complete quickly and running the photo section where the computer was.  Any time a customer needed help, a pickup order needed doing or Chad needed an alcohol sale, I did that.

Finished training and bc there was nothing else to do, I did a few more computer assignments I had. Towards the end of the night, Chad walks over to me and starts ranting. ""I don't get why you get to sit here and do this while I can't and I'm gonna get in trouble for it. It's not fair that I do all the work around here and do a better job than you do but you get paid more for doing less and being on your phone. You're so lazy"". I was stunned

And to add context I'd just like to say nearly everything he said was a crock of shit. He never even mentioned wanting/needing to do that assignment, in fact he nagged me about how slow I was being on it. He wouldn't have gotten in trouble for not having it done either and he knew that. As for the phone thing, every second he wasn't directly in front of a customer, he was behind the register glued to his phone and his usage is far more severe than mine. And as far as working harder, this kid works a few hours a day, a few days a week.


I never want to work with him again and I don't care if that means never getting scheduled with him or flat out getting him fired. I plan on going to the Big Manager tomorrow because I refuse to be harassed and bullied like this",info
"title: WIBTA For wanting to buy a Mustang
content: I (17 year old female) am trying to buy my first car. My family doesn’t come from riches and we were worse off but are now about middle class. We have an older car that my parents bought for my sister but is now given to my brother as he was allowed to get his license before me. I have been saving up for more than 7 months now working as a cashier, paying for gas when my brother takes me back and forth to work, school etc. while also buying food every now and then. Life has definitely been a struggle between my family but this car has definitely been a light at the end of the tunnel. 
    When I was growing up my cousin had a convertible Mustang and when I thought of what car I want, that came to mind. I always loved riding in it and I wanted to buy something I loved as I’ve been the one that’s worked so hard to save the money. So for these months saving I always had that car envisioned, even put it on my vision board on my wall. My parents knew this and allowed me to talk about it and believe I could get it. As the time neared I asked several times if it was ok and they would say maybe or we’ll see. 
 Now I’ve been looking on FB for a car and having my brother and dad take me to see them it occurred to me that buying the same year car as my cousin wouldn’t be a realist option so I’ve been looking for more newer cars in my budget. My father, now seeing my persistence doesn’t want me to buy it while my mother was on board. After driving around looking for the cars now with my mother, (the drive was also cut short) she now changed her mind, yelling at me that it was a bad idea and to not do it even though the few cars we saw, definitely fixer uppers, drove perfectly and wasn’t all of the cars we planned on seeing. She had also decided on giving me about half to the car as I need a car ASAP and that I would pay her off monthly. She said she wished she didn’t agree to give me money and doesn’t want to be the bad guy and say no but will let me make a bad decision and buy it anyway if I really want to.  
  I’m not sure anymore, Everyone seems to be against me but I don’t see the difference of getting a used cool kinda old car than getting some newer used Honda for the same price. I have A’s and B’s in school, do everything I’m told and don’t leave the house. I just want something I really love and can decorate and buy with my money, *I would still have to pay for insurance, gas and anything if it breaks with my money. I see where they are coming from and that they don’t want to bail me out if I make a bad decision but it’s a used car, the newer one could be just as bad.",yta

She only started doing track when I joined this club team, however I have been running track and cross country since freshman year of high school.

"title: WIBTA If I confronted my coworker about calling out
content: Sorry about any formatting issues. I’m on mobile. For context I work at the food court in a big retail store. I’m a barista on weekends, and I make pizzas and wings on weekdays. We had five people scheduled in the front, and everyone who was scheduled to be in by then except the opener O (F25) had called out. When I came in the closer G (F21) wasn’t planning on calling out. The fourth person in ended up calling out as well, so I texted G. I told her we had call outs and that my plan was for her and O to man the front while I’d keep cafe open and take care of their stuff in the back. I also called to ask if she could come in early. She said no. She then told me she was going to call out. We had to call in C (M27) in on his day off to cover her shift and we closed 4 hours early. Looking back I probably shouldn’t have said anything. I just wanted her to know what to expect, and why I was asking if she could come in early. She apologized to O, but was later talking crap about her with another coworker, and we’ve seen each other once since then but she didn’t say anything. Yesterday T (M21) and I were scheduled in the back, but G and another person called out. I had to step in again since both our morning support and pre closer had called out, and we had to close both the back and the front early. I’d give her the benefit of the doubt for yesterday, but she later posted a photo of her going out with some friends during what would’ve been her shift. I don’t normally get upset over these things. Everyone has their reasons I understand, and sometimes you just need to take one for the team. Deliberately leaving us stranded and forcing us to call someone in on their day off just because she doesn’t want to deal with it, and then only saying something to one person. Not even the person who covered her shift. WIBTA if I talked to her about it?",yta
"title: WIBTA If I message my landlord about my roommate’s room?
content: Before I get started I figured I would give you a background of what’s been going on. Back in August of 2022 I(21) moved into a three bedroom apartment with two roommates who well call M(23) and K(20). Originally I got along with M and not K. M was telling me tons of lies about how K thought I was stealing, and was ruining her stuff, or that K didn’t like me. Well fast forward to February, I was tired of this. I confronted K and it turns out that M was telling her the same exact things except about me! Literally the same exact situations and words, word by word. We ended confronting M who already knew what we were mad about. She bought us a massive heating blanket and apologized, blaming it on her bipolar disorder. I didn’t personally feel comfortable and let her know that I wasn’t going to trust her anymore and continue this friendship. I wanted us to be civil roommates however; and life went on. This is a small thing that led up to this point. During that conversation in February, M was also late on paying rent by three weeks. Luckily she paid right after us confronting her as well and we thought that it was over. March comes around and she’s late paying rent again, and two weeks go by. She lies consistently about sending rent. She also starts leaving our front door wide open, starts stealing food, and breaking things. We had a meeting again. The whole time she sat there and rolled her eyes. She didn’t care that someone could come into the apartment and hurt us. She didn’t care that we could’ve been evicted, and she didn’t care about any of our things. We gave her an ultimatum she will not be resigning the lease and if we didn’t receive her rent on time, we will be evicting her. Fast forward to April/May. She continuously broke my things and last week I blew up. I told her that she can never use my things I bought in this apartment again. That she doesn’t respect my time or my money. She has paid rent on time however. This week there’s been a smell in our apartment and it’s been driving me crazy. Like cat pee and something rotting. I cleaned the apartment and couldn’t find anything. Well she left to her moms today and when she left her bedroom, the smell was worse. I never go into my roommates rooms without permission but I had to know that smell was! And you can imagine my surprise when I opened that door, and the worst smell hit me. Her room is a disaster. You can’t even walk without something on the floor blocking you. Rotting food and fast food bags are everywhere. Clothes and trash cover the floor. And that smell, god that smell. She’s been a bad roommate, and doesn’t respect me but I’m hesitant. Should I call my landlord about her room? Will I be the AH?",nta

content: I (22f) have been living with my roommate(21f) since September of 2022; our lease is only a nine month lease, which was her choice. Our lease is up in less than 3 weeks and while I’ve been pushing to find a new place for months she’s only gotten serious about in the past week. The biggest issue we have is a difference in budget-I currently spend over 50% of my income on housing which I am not comfortable doing again but her parents pay her rent so she isn’t concerned about cost. She has stated that her low end budget is $850 without utilities but that’s my max with utilities. This has been extremely stressful for me. 
My older sister (34f) owns her house and offered  me a bedroom in her house for 600+ utilities a month. This is such a kind gesture from my sister and would be much more affordable for me, however I feel like I’d be leaving my roommate high and dry trying to find a place alone on such short notice..but I also feel like she chose to put off finding a new place and I’m getting a great opportunity to build an actual savings account and live around my family (all 3 of my sisters and their families live on the same street.)

"title: WIBTA If I sued my boyfriend’s elderly mother and pressed charges against her?
content: Okay, I know how this sounds. Please hear me out at least.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to “impress” my boyfriend. I’ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is… I try too hard? She has also insisted I’ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I’ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.

Late last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend’s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I’d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn’t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she’s continued to contact and harass me.

This leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I’m okay with that and I’m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it’s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She’s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a “Nasty Serbian half breed.” I’m not Serbian and she’s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.

Then came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they’d received “multiple” claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. 

I’m now at a point where I’ve realised I literally cannot do this. I’m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it’s a crime in the UK) and I’m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don’t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn’t back off and she’s pretty much mocking me and saying I won’t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she’s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don’t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.

WIBTA here if I did this?

It meant so much to me.

My dad passed away this year. It has been the hardest time of my life. I feel as though I have been losing him for so long. I did not cope well with the news and shut down. My dad had always wanted his body donated to science but apparently, he did not meet the qualifications and my brother decided to have him cremated. My brother didn't tell me this, my mom ended up telling me. She said him and one of my father's friends planned to spread his ashes near his friend's house on the ocean. His friend's house is far away. I asked my brother if I could have some of my dad's ashes because I would like to have them nearby. My brother said he would think about it.

My mother ended up getting some of the ashes from him and giving them to me. My brother has been taking all the photos of my dad and heirlooms left at my mother's house. I am okay with him having these things. 

Today my mother called me and said I have to give her the 2 heirlooms she gave me in 2020 back. She said my brother has told her they are his and my dad gave them to him.

"title: WIBTA for Changing My TV Streaming Passwords?
content: Well, this feels a bit petty. But, it would be nice to have unbiased opinions on the matter. So, here goes.

There are various tv shows that I (30M) love to catch up on in my free time. Because of that, I have just about every TV streaming service you could think of. I do share access to these services with my mom and sister. I have created profiles for them and there are no issues there. I also share these services with my best friend, (31M). We will call him Vee. 

Vee refuses to create and/or use his own profile on the streaming platforms. Instead, he uses mine. This is likely because I am the first profile at the top of the list. The issue here is that he and I enjoy many of the same shows. Often, I may pause or stop an episode in the middle of it in order to study, work or go to sleep. 

When Vee watches the same show on my profile, I lose my place and the next time I log in to watch, I have to figure out which episode I left off on and at which point. If he completes the show or movie, it also removes it from my ""Continue Watching"" feature altogether, which leaves me to search for the show AND THEN figure out where I left off. 

This has grown to be pretty frustrating when it happens regularly. Work can be pretty challenging at times and I do think this exacerbates the situation as I tend to use TV to decompress from work.

I have went as far as to create profiles for him and ask him several times to use it. But, I still come back to the same situation. So, WIBTA if I just changed my password altogether, locking him out?

**Why I may BTA:** Well I think I might BTA because this feels like his actions may be insignificant and my response may be inappropriate. It feels like it may be a childish thing to do.

TL;DR My best friend won't use his own profile on streaming networks and it leaves me to figure out where I left off.",info
"title: WIBTA for asking a seller to let me return the item?
content: I will be interning at a hospital this summer, and I was checking FB marketplace for cheap scrubs to wear (I have several, but didn’t know if it was worth it to get more).

I found some Figs scrubs (the nice brand) for a pretty good price, and I asked the seller if they would be able to ship the scrubs and have them here in 3 days. I apologized for the inconvenience! 

She asked for my zip code, and told me she would let me know how much the total price would be. 

The next day, I get a message from her saying she had shipped the scrubs, but had to do it next day, which cost $36. I was taken aback, because I hadn’t paid her for the other scrubs yet, and had I known it cost that much to do that for those, I wouldn’t want to continue with the purchase. But she had already shipped them. So I paid her, but I don’t feel comfortable paying that much. 

It was never communicated to me in advance what the final price would be, and I would not have proceeded if I knew she would have to do it next-day and it would cost that much. 

WIBTA if I asked her to allow returns?

Thanks, everyone! I’m a broke college student, if that helps. 
Also, it was coming from one state over.",yta
"title: WIBTA for backing out of a trip?
content: throwaway account

So I (18F) graduate HS in 2 weeks.

In March I suggested to C (17F) and A (18F) that we go on a trip to Disney, just the 3 of us, no parents, so we can celebrate and have some fun. Both A and C said that was a great idea.

We end up deciding to go to Universal instead. We live in Florida, so it’s not a problem for us. C’s mom is okay with our plan but doesn’t want us to go to Universal, but eventually gives C the okay. A and C’s families have annual passes to Universal and Disney respectively, so they prefer the park they have passes for.

I tell A and C we need to make some more concrete plans but I’m dismissed a few times until they relent and I get a text from A in the group chat. A says that her dad is booking a 2 bedroom suite and told us the dates. It’s 2 days after graduation. My grandma is flying into town for it, and so that’s a conflict for me. I ask to change the dates and A says no because they can’t get a suite for other days but I did get the dates changed to 3 days after instead. Still not very good since grandma will be here, but it’s the only way my parents will sign off on it.

Saturday C asked about the itinerary, A says we’re leaving for the parks very early, staying the whole day, and getting up “ridiculously early” (her words, not mine) to do it again, and get home really late. I objected and said no to rope dropping, we’ll be tired from the first day and the heat will only make it worse. Even C agreed with me and she likes rope dropping at theme parks, but we still got denied.

It bothered me enough that I told my parents at lunch about it and the suite. They told me to ask about the suite because it was weird to rent a 2 bedroom suite for 3 of us, and I agreed. I text the group chat and then get a private response from C saying that it’s for A’s family, and that both of their parents talked about it or something. Then A texts confirming her family is coming. At this point I’m uncomfortable, the whole point of the trip was for us 3 to celebrate graduating and becoming adults, and everyone’s families were okay with it being just us. Now it’s A’s family vacation with me and C as guests, and I know that’ll feel awkward. And I’m also a bit bitter that C and A discussed it without telling me anything, had I not asked then I wouldn’t have found out until the day of. Even if they say we’ll be on our own in the parks, we’ll be in the same room, go to and from the parks together, and eat meals together. 

Now I don’t want to go anymore, it’s not what I agreed to and even my parents are annoyed that the other families discussed without them. They said I don’t have to go if I don’t want to since we haven’t bought a ticket. But I know C would pull out too if I did, and I wouldn’t want to ruin it for her or A. And I don’t really want to go if I won’t have a lot of fun, especially since my grandma will be in town. WIBTA if I pulled out?",nta
"title: WIBTA for calling out my olderbrother for not supporting my wedding?
content: I (20s M) and my brother (30s M) have a 10 year difference in age. To the group of us siblings that still talk, him and I have the most strained relationship. He doesn't get me, I don't understand him, and honestly after recently I don't care anymore and truth be told, want to cry a little.

My wedding at this point is a month away and he (in my opinion) has been the least supportive of my wedding.
He doesn't really acknowledge my Fiancé unless she is sort of the last person there and has to make small talk and it's very basic things and that's it. She is to the point where she loves him because of me, and supports me having a relationship with him and that's about it. It hurts her that he doesn't try to get to know her like I've tried to know and include his wife into our family.
My brother criticized who my best man was originally, and was what felt like an ultimatum if I didn't make someone else my best man, he'd step down from being in my wedding. This isn't including not sleeping in the same rental house as my (former for this and other reasons) best man. 
Originally we wanted to go to a different city in my state to have a combined Bachelor/Bachelorette party so it's not the same hum drum bars we go to now. Though I understood his point of money and time for everyone, what makes it frustrating is now, his child (my nephew) has a foot all camp the same weekend as our Bach party, and I'm not mad or upset of them supporting their child (I have to accept that and I feel would be selfish if I didn't), but now they have to leave early and won't be back till 4 days before my wedding (these events are the weekend before my wedding). Not like there is something to do, we are finishing up stuff this  month, but to have my Fiancé and I change plans for our Bach party for him seems frustrating, and I feel I *am* an asshole for that.

In the past 6 months we've had numerous discussions of our relationship and to improve it, and I have reached out first in order to show I am apart of the family and I want our relationship better, but the majority of our interactions have been when he as called me something related to my job and that has been it.

The issue with the football camp kinda broke me, and it feels as far as my side of the wedding goes, it's just my younger brother who hasnt stopped supportingme, and between the wedding and the stress, I can't stop being upset about this. Will I be the asshole for talking to him about all of this?

He does do things for me. He actually got me a full refund for the rented house from the former Bach party idea, he always goes out of his way if I did ask him for something, but to me it's worth never getting a present or a favor from him again if I knew he just cared to call me, be invested in what I have going on in life, and just be as supportive as our younger brother is. Thank you all for reading this.

Edit: wow didn't expect all this feedback. I do appreciate it.
First off, no the football camp wasn't the same time as the party. It was frustrating to see that I was previously told they wouldn't be able to have any money or time off if it wasn't in town, and now they have these readily available. To me, he's nearly a senior in high school he's used to being on his own? But I honestly feel I'm being spiteful at that point. Thank you for making me feel good that I'm not turning into a groomzilla by feeling bad for remotely thinking like that.

Secondly, I am bad when it comes to having confrontation with my direct family. I get very emotional and not sure why. I don't take the title of best man very serious as far as my wedding goes, so to me it's about having those who have been there for me to stand with me. Part of it the confrontation, part of it because he doesn't like him and how he doesn't represent how a marriage should be (my brother is right about that), and partly I'd rather change things around to have him up there rather than him watching me from the crowd.",info
"title: WIBTA for going to the funeral of my ex GF's brother and missing my « SIL »'s wedding ?
content:  I (M25) am in a relationship with Amelia (F26) since 2 years, she is wonderful, we live together and I think we are close to engagement. 

&#x200B;

  
  In the past, I was in a relationship with Julia (25F), we met in high school and had a very passoniate relationship for 5 years but it didn't work. In the end it got quite heated between us and even with her parents, so we blocked each other. Julia had a brother Dan, 2 years younger, and we always shared a special bond.   
 

Like me, he wanted to become doctor and I helped him with med school. Even after the breakup, we stayed close (Julia and their parents weren't aware), he was definitely very important for me, almost like a younger brother. 

  
  Unfortunately, Dan had a car crash and died last week, I didn't know until Julia came to my home to anounce 2 days ago, I am absolutely devastated. She apologized because she wasn't aware that Dan and I were still close, she also thanked me for being there for him when he was fighting  depression and that all her family would like to see me at his funeral next Sunday in their hometown (7 hours drive), I replied that I wasn't sure if I could come because I'm running low on money at the moment and my car will be at the mechanic's, she said she could drive me there but she had to be there 2 days earlier to help with the organisation, I said that I will think about it, we exchanged numbers and hugged, she cried a little and said she was sorry for all the things of the past and was happy to see me again. 

&#x200B;

  
  Amelia came home at this moment, and I explained the situation when Julia left (she already knew about my past relationship with Julia and my friendship with Dan).  Amelia told me that I wouldn't be able to go at the funeral because the wedding of her sister is the same day and we both agreed to go. I said that I need a bit of time to proceed all that. 

&#x200B;

  
  The following morning, I had a very emotionnal phone call with Dan and Julia's parent, they apologized for the past and thanked me for being there for Dan, that they would always consider me family from now, they insisted that they'd like to host me for the funeral to save me cost.   

  
  After reflection, even if it sucks for Amelia and the wedding, I cannot imagine missing Dan's funeral, I talked with my co residents the head of unit and they're ok with me missing a few days and cover for me. When I told my decision to Amelia yesterday, she blowed up and said that I'm a huge dick to ditch her and her family in favor of my ex's, she said that I committed to the wedding and I couldn't leave her alone to reconnect with my ex. We had a big argument and haven't talk much since. I had some messages from her friends and her sister, they said that I'm a major asshole for abandonning my GF  in favor of my ex. 

&#x200B;

  
  I was sure about doing the good choice but I start to feel bad and second guess myself, so AITA ?",yta

My family however has no idea and this is because of my mother. My family is Hispanic so if one person finds out forget it the whole world knows in less than 24 hours.

"title: WIBTA for keeping my grandparent’s wedding rings.
content: To give some background, I’m M40 and have had the rings for awhile. I was in my early 20s when my grandmother died. My grandfather died when I was 13. Of his 30 grandchildren, I was the one that he felt closest to in life. Once he had his first stroke and was largely incapable of speech, I spent a lot of time just talking to him about things. I would later find out from my grandmother that that meant a lot to him. As such, he bequeathed his ring to me, stating it would be mine once my grandmother passed too. My grandmother agreed and also bequeathed her ring to me for the complete set. 

Anyway, my family mainly hid the fact that I got the rings, along with other valuable sentimental objects. However, now that my aunts and uncles are regrettably passing away too, I’ve begun more prominently displaying the objects I received from my grandparents in my house. 

Now, I stayed single. Marriage never really jumped out at me and as I ages it became clear that I would likely never marry. I have only one sibling, who did eventually marry. He has two kids. One day we are at my house  where I’ve now placed the rings in a glass case. They are both low quality golden rings, no gems. When my sister in law saw them, she asked about them and I have her the story. While she was largely polite, she felt a little slighted that my brother didn’t get the rings. He too was rather close with our grandparents, though he spent more time with our grandmother than I did. 

She largely thinks he doesn’t do enough to fight for himself and she feels this is one of those situations. She insinuated I should consider giving them the rings so they could actually use them instead of display them. Now, I don’t plan on allowing this to happen. That’s the end of the story there. However, I do already have it in writing, and my brother explained to her, that upon my death, the rings will go to my brother’s eldest as I don’t have and likely will never have kids of my own. AITA for not giving them the rings now though?",nta
"title: WIBTA for kicking my broke and pregnant sister out of my house?
content: A year ago, I bought what I see as a 26 year old girls dream home. At the same time, my 22 year old sister was graduating college, with no money & no job & needed a place to stay. We agreed that she could move in with me, & after getting a job, would start paying rent until she got back on her feet. She got a job as a substitute teacher but was only making $14/hr. This worked for some time with no issues until about 3 months ago when she hit rock bottom. She informed me that she could no longer afford to pay rent. At the same time, it was her birthday so I told her that I would give her one month free from rent for her birthday. The following month, she was still struggling which I hate to see, so I made a deal that if she didnt pay rent again that she would use the rent money to put towards her debt. She agreed. Now it is month three. 

She recently downloaded Tinder & allowed a random guy into my home to sleep with him. Now, she is pregnant, after not taking her birth control correctly, not wearing a condom, & not making the man pull out. She has told me that she wants to keep the child. I only have one other room as a guest room & she wants to use that room as the nursery. I mentioned having the childs crib in her room as to keep the guest room for family/friends to come stay & help with the child or just if they needed it, but she was very unhappy about this option & did not want to give up her room for the child. Over the last few months I have had tens of thousands of dollars worth of problems arise to include having to get a brand new roof, etc. Now, with all the extra payments I have, on top of my sister no longer being able to pay rent, & a soon to be newborn, I will likely have to sell my house to be able to afford to take care of my sister & her newborn. It is not my job but I dont want to see her fail. I want her to have a stable living situation. My parents live far from us & cannot afford to help, & although the baby daddy wants to be involved, she just met him & knows nothing about him or his living situation. We have a close relationship & I want to support her when she needs it but I am now at risk of having to sell my house & find a new place to live in order to be able to help her. She is not helping herself though by finding a new & higher paying job; she keeps saying she will get to it eventually in regards to getting medical insurance for the baby (she is still under my parents insurance), & much more, which proves she is not ready maturity wise. 

I am at a loss because I dont want to give up my dream home & my life for a mistake that I had no part in but I also never want to see anyone else struggle or have hardships if I can help in some way. I work full time on top of overtime already & have now applied for a weekend/evening serving position to try & make extra money before things tank, but would I be an asshole if I kick her out or force her to pay rent when she doesnt have the money & needs to save before having a baby?",info
"title: WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?
content: My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.

The theft: 

On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.

Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. 

I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",nta
"title: WIBTA for missing my cousin’s bridal party?
content: I (21f) am planning on attending a wedding abroad this summer (August). Without specifying the country, it is approximately a 1.30hr flight so it is not a lengthy journey.

My cousin is hosting a bridal party a couple of days before the wedding. She has invited every female member of her family to the party. However, I don’t plan on attending the party - only the wedding. My mother is NOT happy about this as she feels it is rude to miss the bridal party without good reason. I don’t plan on attending her bridal party for the following reasons:

1) her bridal party is about 4 days before the wedding. The tickets are much cheaper if I fly in for the wedding alone (think around £200 of a discount). 

2) It goes without saying that the wedding is more important than the bridal party. I only want to attend one event and I think it’s obvious that the wedding is prioritised.

3) I am not even close to this cousin at all. She does not live in the same country as me, however she is also not that far, we are both based in Europe and our countries are only 2hr flights apart. I have met her in person a few times, I message her a few times a year to wish her a happy birthday, happy new year etc. but you get the idea of our relationship.

I truly believe she will not be offended if I miss the bridal party. Plus, I ideally want to fly in a day or two before the wedding and fly out 2/3 days later as I’d like to focus on my work and studies here. 

My mother is insisting that it’s rude and I cannot miss the party when she told her I’d be attending. I told her that I am an adult and she cannot force me to go and I did not promise her anything. Further, I’m paying for the tickets with my own money and so I think she doesn’t have a say on what dates I choose to fly or how long I stay there.",nta
"title: WIBTA for not hiring my friend as a photographer?
content: So i have a pretty big event coming up that i worked very hard for, and among other things i need to hire a photographer. Obviously i will pay them, but it's also the kind of thing that is very good for publicity. 

My friend, let's call him Liam, has constantly expressed his interest in this position. Liam is an amateur photographer and while i would like to hire people i already know, i don't really know if i can trust him with it.

The thing is, i've been in 2 situations where he has photographed me and my friends. The first time all of the photos were pretty bad (not in focus, blurry) and the second time he was drunk and opened the camera in a way that ruined the film and all the photos (i'm not that familiar with film photography).

The photographer i hire will also have access to the same perks as me, which include free food and alcohol. The alcohol is relevant, since Liam is the kind of person that gets shit-faced and ruins the night for everyone else. I've let him crash in my place multiple times even though he lives in the same city because he lost his keys/ wasn't in the condition to be left alone.

I am seriously considering just hiring a professional for the job, but our mutual friends are against it and think i should just hire him because he could really benefit from the opportunity. So would i be the asshole if i didn't hire him?",nta
"title: WIBTA for not letting my friend move in for a month?
content: I have a friend I've known for a few years and it's fair to say we're pretty close. They're moving from their current apartment to a different one in a few months but there's a month gap where they won't have a place to live. Originally, they were going to stay with their sibling during that gap, but that fell through (I'm not sure why.)

They have not asked me personally, but they have posted on social media - basically asking for a temporary room/couch. 

Technically, we (my spouse and I) have the room to house them for the month. We have a guest room, guest bath, etc. They work full time, but we wouldn't need to ask for help with our rent, utilities, groceries, etc. Our home, in theory, would probably be the easiest place for them to be. 

A few weeks back, (before the moving stuff) while my friend and I were having some drinks, they asked if my spouse and I would ever have a threesome. I laughed it off and told them I think we're both happy sleeping only with each other. They kept pushing - kept asking why - asking who out of all my friends I would have a threesome with, if I had to. I was getting pretty uncomfortable at this point and did my best to shut down the conversation. They ended it basically saying they would sleep with both of us in a heartbeat. I had no idea they were attracted to my spouse, let alone ME, in a sexual way and it definitely altered the way I view our friendship. 

Also to add, if it's important, their view of monogamous relationships has been soured since their long time relationship ended and they are pretty vocal about wanting to try polyamory. 

Here's where I may be the AH. For this reason, I don't want to offer them our place to stay. My spouse works from home some days - I don't ever work from home- and Friend works rotating hours - meaning there would be times where they would be at the house alone. I fully trust my spouse - I know they'd never engage and would probably kick them out of our house if they even hinted at anything. And before this threesome conversation, I fully trusted my friend as well. I just don't even want to create a possible scenario where the topic could come up again. 

I'm not sure the best way to say no, even if they do ask me personally. Does it make me an AH to not even entertain the idea because my trust, while not broken, has been damaged because of a conversation over alcohol?",nta
"title: WIBTA for not paying for a lost license plate?
content: A few days ago I hit a car while reversing on a parking lot. It was only a very small push with my towbar, so only a bit of the plastic encasing of the license plate broke off, and the license plate itself tilted forwards a bit. 
Naturally, I left a note stating my phone number and my name, and put it behind the windscreen wiper. My intention was to pay for the damage done. 

However, the owner of the car called just today, asking me if I took the license plate. I told her I didn't, and it turned out she didn't notice the note (1/3 of A4) and drove of, losing her license plate along the way most likely (or someone stole it). I sent photos of the original damage to the owner.

As of now, I am very much in doubt what I should reimburse.

"title: WIBTA for not showing up to my fathers 40th birthday?
content: 
Names changed for obvious reasons.

My (19F) father (39M) is turning 40 next month. My mother (38F) and father have been divorced for 5 years. I hav 2 full blooded siblings. Janice (10F) and Phil (18M) along with a step brother Isaac (12M) and a half brother Henry (6M). I may have the ages wrong for my step brother and half brother but that is because I have not seen them since I was 16. But that is besides the point. Needless to say the reasons for divorce were messy. My father had an affair with my mothers friend Mora (38F) from high school and wanted to have an open relationship. My mother who is Christian said absolutely not and my father dropped the divorce on her.

My mother got 75% custody over us and moved out of the house that my father rented. She moved in with my grandmother who is a rockstar for taking in me and my siblings. Due to my mothers medical condition she is unable to work or drive so, she had been a stay at home mom since I was born. My father was the one who was providing for our family financially. With his job as a member in the army.

My father married Mora about a year or two after the divorce. She had his child a year into dating and after he had introduced us to her. There was some drama with Mora and my mother. Just for example: Her and her sister threw eggs at my grandmothers house (I know because I was there when it happened and watched her do this), she fought my mother outside the school parking lot for my conference (she lost by the way), and called my mother unfit and lazy despite knowing her medical history (I know this because she and I had followed each other on her Facebook).

My father never stood up for my mother in this time and stood by what his new wife was saying and doing. He spent less time with me and my siblings and more time with her child and my half brother. I want to note that my two full blooded siblings Janice and Phil are on the spectrum and have autism. My half sibling and step brother do not. It is blatantly obvious that my father favors them because they are “normal” and “easier to deal with.” These are quotes from his mouth by the way.

He missed very important moments in my life. I want to be an actress and I had landed a gig at a theatre in my state that is fairly well known when I was 16. I invited everyone to come see me and everyone came except for my father. His reasoning was because it was too far of a drive and that gas was expensive. My great grandfather who is well into his 80s made a point to come. He lives only 30 minutes from my father and has a similar financial situation to him and he made sure he could see me. So, I see my fathers excuse as complete nonsense. 

There are other things my father has done to me and my family but if I were to list everything I would run out of room. So, should I show up to my fathers big 40th birthday when he has missed major milestones in my life and after everything he has done to me and my family?",nta
"title: WIBTA for not taking care of my grandma anymore?
content: 
Whould I be the asshole for telling my grandparents that I won't be visiting  anymore to take care of my grandma   but I still want to visit to help my grandpa in his yard/garage work?

I currently live with my mom and work full time. I visit my grandparents everyday for about an hour to 2 hours. I help my grandma mostly by putting her socks on and taking them off. Everything else I do for her (get her a specific item, brew her coffee) are things she can do on her own, given it's a fair bit of effort for her unfortunately.  She has alot of illnesses that make her mostly chair bound. Partly because she's very old and sick, partly she refuses some treatments and activities. It's hard to do things when everything hurts. She is taken care of fully by my grandpa. He care takes everything in the house, cooking every meal ,groceries, doctor's appointments. Everything. He is burnt out. He's very clearly suffering from caretakers fatigue. Yet my grandma feels that she is neglected by him because she has to remind him to get her something or to do something. They are both in their 80s. He's senile. She's senile. It's just a thing. They argue about the same thing because they forgot they already argued about it. 
I feel very stuck in the middle.
I am very busy with my life now, I know my grandparents are only going to get more sick. I feel very guilty about this  , but I don't have the guts to be involved in my grandmas care if I can't alleviate the sheer amount of stress my grandpa has.  Their relationship works for them. It chould of benefited from marriage counseling,  but that wasn't popular in my area ,ever.
I know if I don't help my grandpa with his yard/garage work he won't be able to build things or garden. It's the only thing he and I really bond over and it's the only thing I ever get to see him laugh and smile about. I don't have a father and he's the closest I do have to one.
They need care , long term care. They have the money for it and insurance. But my grandma believes that she doesn't need much done. When in reality she needs alot done. She just doesn't want anyone other than grandpa to do it. Including me.

I just can't do this anymore. I'm tired and stressed out and I'm very upset. I feel very guilty. I know I'm going to be asked why can't I. And I just don't have an excuse. I contribute nothing  , except enable an environment for my grandpa to be held with all the responsibilities. That's the way they want it ok. My other siblings live with them and also work full-time,  I feel like if they need help, they will safely get it from them. I just can't continue.",info
"title: WIBTA for not taking my ex to see Taylor Swift
content: I got Taylor Swift tickets last November. I got two tickets, and was undecided about who I would take with me. In December, I decided I would take my girlfriend at the time since she started listening to Taylor because of me, and I had essentially turned her into a swiftie

We ended up breaking up a few months later, but remained close friends so I figured I would still take her with me

However, lately it's like everything she does is bothersome. (Constantly interrupting me, asking me about very personal topics in public and not even trying to be quiet, and stuff like that.) I was planning on talking to her about it, but then she did something REALLY shitty (we had agreed to be partners for an assignment, and I found out through Instagram that she did it without me and didnt even say anything) She 'apologized' (claimed she thought she had told me, yet also saying she felt bad when she made the decision) and I decided to act civil since we had several classes together and it was so close to the end of the semester

Now that the semester's ended and she's gone home, I've been thinking about the tickets, and I'm really not sure if I want to take her

But if I decided to take someone else, I would feel bad because my ex has been excited about it for awhile and literally became a swiftie because of me. But also, they're my tickets and she hasnt even paid me yet

(Also, the tickets are for one of the shows thats months away, so it wouldn't be a last minute thing)

So, WIBTA if I decided not to take her?",nta
"title: WIBTA for not telling my wife about a possible tumor.
content: I (38m) recently had a medical emergency while out of town and collapsed from a seizure. I’ve never had this happen before and was rushed to the hospital. My friend who I was traveling with kept my wife completely updated on everything until I was able to talk to her. I was released from the hospital and instructed to follow up with a neurologist at home. 

I followed up with the specialists and he ordered a bunch of tests including an mri. I picked up the results from the mri lab and read the report. Essentially they found a tumor on my pituitary gland. I’ve been doing a bunch of research on it and in the grand scheme it’s very minor. Now on to where I may be TA. 

My wife is already very worried (rightfully so) and would not be able to focus on anything else in the mean time until we get answers. I don’t want to tell her what my report says until I, first hear it from the doctor, in case I read something wrong. Second speak with the doctor so I can have all the answers to the questions I know my wife will ask. 

I have every intention of divulging everything as soon as I get the official word. I have my follow up in a few more days  with the neurologist where we go over the results and I’ll hopefully get all the answers. So WIBTA if I kept this info to myself until I’ve been given the official word from the neurologist?

Edited to add, this type of tumor is very rarely cancerous. Also there’s nothing for her to monitor on me that she isn’t already aware of because of the potential for another seizure.",info
"title: WIBTA for not wishing my mother happy mothers day
content: Just as the title says..So background :

Over my Christmas Break I (F20) turned off my life 360 that my mother had us (My two older and younger brother, my aunt, and grandmother) use for years (my mother has sometype of severe paranoia but to the point that she had control over everything  i did, including knowing my location and constantly watching where id go and then texting me about it. But not in a “are you safe” kind of way but a “life 360 is a snitch, ill always know where you are” kind of way) My two oldest brothers (Ms 24 and 26) got off of it at the same age as i did and my mother didnt respond in any type of way. I got a call from her one day asking why i turned it off, i expressed that it wasn’t necessary anymore, that im starting to move out on my own, and my older brothers did the same. She then proceeded to yell and ask who takes care of me as trying to say she does. She does not, and was actually abusive towards me growing up and I mentioned that as we argued back and forward. She then told me to never return and that she wanted the car back. (The car is in her name but all the money that goes toward it is mine, im the one who put the downpayment on it also and she has never once helped me) 

Fast foward to my 20th birthday and she didnt call me or even text me to wish me a happy birthday all because of this life 360 fight. Mothers day is on Sunday and I will be going to stay with my grandmother for my summer break until i get my apartment next year, however everyone in my family who knows about this argument keeps saying I should wish her a happy mothers day because she is my mother after all and not stoop down to her level of not even wishing the child she birthed, who took care of her kids and her happy birthday. I get that she gave birth to me but she was never really a mother to me, she just caused me PTSD and continues to deny she had done anything to me and that im lying and being over dramatic. I dont want to wish her happy mothers day but at the same time i feel that would cause more tension in my already broken family🤷🏾‍♀️

So Would I be the Asshole for not wishing my mother a happy mothers day?

TTLDR: my family is telling me i should wish my abusive mother happy mothers day even though she didnt wish my happy birthday because i got off life 360 and we had a bad argument over it",nta
"title: WIBTA for reaching out to an ex bf that I am friends with to see how he is after a breakup?
content: A little bit of back story, we don’t know each other in person, we met online in 2004 and played a game together for a couple years.  We were inseparable for that time.  We loved each other, got married in the game, had plans to meet in person but we were young.  Eventually real life happened, I moved to a rural place without a good internet connection and we spent less and less time together.  Eventually I broke up with him because of the lack of connection(or effort to make a connection). We talked a little for probably a year after that in an effort to stay friends, because we really were good friends.  Then I got married and stopped talking to him.  Eventually he also got married. We both had kids.  

Anyways, over the last few years we exchanged a couple messages on the game, and then switched to emailing.  Sent a few long emails back and forth at the end of last year and then when he couldn’t keep up I suggested messenger.  We talked a little on there.  Met up in the game and played together just a little. Kept it completely platonic, just getting to know each other a little and remembering what we already knew.  We really didn’t talk very much.  I didn’t feel pursued at all. We didn’t talk about our relationships much. He’s always been very respectful, to the point where I wonder if I’m the one being disrespectful by initiating the conversations.. but he’s always been a bit quiet.

Now in the last week he changed his picture to just himself and his wife changed hers to a questionable picture with a female friend. And his profile says separated.  I’m worried about him because I know he doesn’t usually reach out.  I don’t want to cross a line.  My relationship is also in an unstable place right now, but I have no desire to cheat or pursue someone else.  Purely as a friend I want to reach out.  How do I show purely friendly concern? I really want to just say “hey, I see you’ve got some major life changes happening right now, how are you doing?” But is that crossing a line because of our previous relationship? WIBTA if I reach out to see how he is? Especially if him and his wife get back together?

Just to add, I don’t want to seem like I’m pursuing him in a romantic way, in case that wasn’t clear.  My husband is controlling and abusive and I come from a strict religious background so I feel like I might consider reaching out to be “bad” because of that.  But is showing concern for a friend really that bad?  And I could use all the friends I can get right now.  At the same time, what if my ex bf is exactly like my current husband(even though they both give off very different vibes) and I’m just opening up more shit for myself?",nta
"title: WIBTA for refusing to see my friend who ignores my messages?
content: I'm F/35, my friend (""Maya"") is F/34.  We've known each other for a few years and are good friends.  Maya is married with a kid in preschool, so she's busy and her schedule can be unpredictable.  Nevertheless, we see each other often, usually about once a week, and it's usually a good time.

Maya has one habit that drives me crazy: she will ignore almost any texts I send to her.  No matter whether it's something casual or something more important, she almost never responds.  (Meanwhile she does pretty regularly text me, and I always respond.)  Obviously with work and family it may not always be possible to respond right away, but she doesn't respond at all, not even the next day or the day after.

I've tried to make clear to Maya that this bothers me, several times.  It makes me feel used.  It feels like she can reach out to me whenever she wants my company or support, but when I try to do the same, she feels free to ignore it.  I've said this many times, and usually Maya apologizes and says she'll do better, but she never does.  In practice, I've mostly just stopped reaching out, unless it feels urgent and can't wait until we next meet up.

Last week, this happened again.  I had to make a decision about something work-related and texted Maya.  I never heard back and it made me so mad.  Just now, Maya texted to see if I want to meet up tomorrow.  I'm thinking of telling her no and explaining why.  I like her and would like to stay friends, but this communication imbalance makes me so angry.  But I'm not sure if refusing to see her is just passive aggressive and not a good way of dealing with this.  WIBTA if I told her no and also told her why?",yta
"title: WIBTA for rejecting my sister’s Christmas gift?
content: Recently I 20F received a dress as a gift for Christmas from my sister 26F. I am very explicit about not wanting gifts for birthdays or any other kind of celebration because I live a very minimalistic lifestyle and would rather save up money to buy myself nicer things when I graduate and have my own place. My sister and I have gotten into arguments before about buying gifts (especially as she tries to buy me makeup, accessories, and other feminine things which I don’t use at all). I am not averse to receiving money as a gift as I like to save up to pay for tuition fees for my studies alongside my part time job. Another issue I have with gifts is that usually when my family give me gifts it’s almost always things I will never use or things that I do not like and it makes me feel like they don’t pay attention enough to my personal life or interests. I have discussed with my other sisters 21F and 24F about returning the dress, which is not my style and isn’t designed to fit me, to my sister so she can get a refund. But both have called me TA and have said I am being ungrateful by not accepting the dress. Personally I do not see what is wrong with what I am doing because I have already made it clear many times before that I do not want to receive gifts for special occasions and my sister had already told me she wouldn’t buy me any gifts after an argument we had, however she has gone back on her word and bought me the dress. I understand she did it with good intentions but I have made my stance clear on not wanting gifts and she has decided to go against it. WIBTA?",yta
"title: WIBTA for reverting back to my maiden name despite still being married ?
content: To be clear, I love my partner very much and we have very little problems, typical run of the mill isssus triggered by the typical stressers (finances, raising kids etc).

Partner has a bit of a traditional mindset in that it was never questioned that I would take their family name. I also didnt really question it so I assumed the name in my personal life. I did not assume it in my business and professional life, citing that I built a reputation, network, honours, successes all with my born last name and did not want to lose any of that work with a name change. Privately, I also thought whatever ""honour"" I might bring to this world should be associated with my mom and dad, the people that raised and supported me. Not that im expecting to be the next president, just saying. 

Anyways. That got complicated and it became increasingly difficult to maintain the delineation. Honestly it just confused the F out of people. I had kids and wanted to have the same last name as them so I assumed partners name in both professional and private life.

I regret it for various reasons. The ones from above, but also because I have an...interesting relationship with partners family. The best I can describe it is I dont feel like a fully fledged member. They are kind, generous people but there is a hierarchy. I am not blood, I am second tier married in. Not going to get into examples (unless you guys want), but there have been things said and done that demonstrate my status. And so, if I dont feel like a real XYZ why is my name XYZ?

BUT I am worried this would make me an asshole to my partner. I once changed my name on a social media account and partner was hurt. They said it was THEIR and OUR name not just partners born family name.  And by doing something like that I was creating division between partner and I, as well as me and partner family. That we are building our own family and own history etc.  I saw the logic and gave it up. But it still does not feel in my heart like my name. 

At the same time, maybe I am being petty. Maybe I should not expect to be treated (at least outwordly)  the same as my partner or their siblings coupled with the desire for honour to go to my parents, and so the move to maiden name is born out of pettiness.   

So WIBTA for changing my name back to my maritial name and possibly offending my partner and his family as it could be percieved as me segregating myself from them or just plain insulting ?",nta
"title: WIBTA for revoking an invite to my wedding?
content: I (29F) am getting married later this year. We sent out save the dates 2 years ago when we got engaged and now we're about to send out formal invitations. At the time, I sent a StD to a friend. We had been close until then, but the last two years we've barely spoken. There wasn't a falling out, and nothing particularly happened. We both became quite different people, and our views on the world don't align anymore. But in the last year, we've spoken literally once and that was in September 22. I don't really want her to come to the wedding, but I feel like I made a commitment that I ought to keep. Would I be the asshole if I just didn't send her an invitation? Or is it better to invite her, if for no other reason than a reflection of the friendship we did once have?

"title: WIBTA for setting boundaries with the Mother-in-law?
content: Sorry for the rant and rabbit trail.

My wife (28) and I (30) have been struggling financially for a while now. I work 44 hours a week, and my wife works 15 hours a week in the evenings and on Sundays (she can't mentally work a full-time job).

My mother-in-law has been arguing for a while now that we have a risk tolerance that is too high for our daughter (2). Our daughter has a mattress on the floor, a couch close to the floor, plenty of toys, a dresser, and a desk with her TV on it. We can play music or shows on it if she gets fussy or for bedtime. She plays in her room alone for about an hour or so in the mornings after she wakes up, so my wife can sleep a little longer.

My mother-in-law says this is bad and our daughter shouldn't be left alone for any reason for more than about 15 minutes. She also insists that if our daughter gets up to play at night (which she often does), one of us needs to get up to supervise her. She says that if we don't do this and our daughter hurts herself seriously enough to go to the hospital, then the state is going to take her from us.

My mother-in-law has this conversation with my wife seemingly once a month, and my wife comes out of it feeling terrible. We've decided that if we want it to stop, then we should let my mother-in-law make the rules and tell us what to do. This would mean my wife would have to drop her hours to about 5 a week to get enough sleep. The in-laws have agreed to help us financially since we already can't pay all the bills.

I'd like to set some boundaries since we are our daughter's parents and can decide what's best for our family, but my mother-in-law got super pissed off the only time I had this conversation with her a couple of days ago. My worry is that if I set these boundaries, I could burn a bridge and ruin my wife's relationship with her mom. Would that make me the asshole? What should I do?",yta
"title: WIBTA for un-inviting someone from a group holiday
content: So for context.  I used to work closely with with a guy we’ll call Stuart. I considered him a friend but on retrospect I wouldn’t really say it was a friendship in the traditional sense and more just because we worked together.  He’s the kind of guy that will help you out but not because it’s what you do for friends but because you’re then due him a favour.  
A couple of years ago he wasn’t having the best of time of it at home so I invited him on a group holiday I regularly go on.  It’s all guys that have families and it’s just a few days away where no one has any responsibility and get to chill out. He came along as my friend and had a great time.  Now these holidays are good, they’re cheap and cheerful and organised by my brother in law. 
Stuart was added to a group chat at the time because it makes organising and get info much easier.  
The holidays took a break due to covid and Stuart’s marriage fell apart.  At that point I was hearing from him constantly.  

When the next post covid holiday was announced Stuart invited himself on to it without even asking if it was ok. At the time we were still working together and I still classed him as a friend and felt bad due to his separation so didn’t say anything. 

Since that holiday though I left the company we work for and he’s doing well and  we no longer speak as much if at all and then I started noticing that the only time I heard from him was when he needed something.  

Another holiday was announced and I couldn’t make it due to a business trip. Again he signed up for it without even asking if I was going. Now Stuart has no links to the people on this holiday and they are all friends outside of the holiday.  Stuart was purely there as my friend. It took 6 months for Stuart to even check if i was going. I also found out that he was attempting to invite other people to the holiday without even checking with my BIL it was ok. 
Now this one leaves next month but the other day there was a message about next years holiday and again Stuart has said he’s going and within the hour he again had offered other people that aren’t connected with the group to go on this holiday without checking it was ok and again without even asking if I was going. 
In the last 6 months I’ve heard from Stuart 3 times. All of these were purely because he needed something. 

I’m speaking to my BIL about it tonight but would I be the AH for un-inviting him from the holiday.",info

content: TLDR: I'm a trans guy out to my transphobic family and want to wear a suit to my transphobic grandfather's funeral. WIBTA for making a scene?

ETA: I'm not wearing a suit *to* cause a scene, I'm wearing a suit because a suit is a formal outfit for men, and I am a man, although most of my family won't see me as one.

I'm a 21 year old trans man and my grandfather is dying. At this point its only a matter of days so me planning how I'm going to be at the funeral is how I'm coping.

I'm certain that it's going to be a fairly large funeral as we're a fairly large family, as well as it being a traditional church service with everyone dressed in their Sunday Best. So, I'd like to rent a suit so I can look nice.

Growing up, my siblings were fairly close to my grandparents, we'd visit them every other holiday and usually visit twice a year for spring break or a week during summer vacation.

When I came out, I never made a big deal about, and especially not at large events, but after passive aggressive backlash I now only visit during the typical weddings and funerals.

I had asked my mom where I can rent a suit, and she immediately said it was a bad idea and I'd be looking for a fight, that I'd cause a scene just to make a statement.

That's not my intent at all, I just want to wear a fucking suit and grieve the grandfather who only called me his granddaughter, it's not like I'm showing up in a purple tux like the joker.

"title: WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?
content: My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty.

"title: WIBTA if I asked my husband and his brothers to limit the amount of guests
content: Im in the unfortunate situation that I’m due to give birth the day after my in laws 25 years wedding anniversary. I live with my in laws. My husband revealed that there are 46 people coming to a party that him and his brothers want to host to celebrate my in laws. The party will be taking place at the house, so I can’t really escape it. My in laws are already having a party next year with the same people because they wanted to take into consideration that I’m going to give birth. 

I don’t see how it’s appropriate to throw a big party with 46 people the day before I’m due when my husband and I just had a party this weekend where we were 11 people in all. We had our first wedding anniversary yesterday but our birthdays are also later in the month of May, and we decided to celebrate everything yesterday (both birthdays and anniversary) so that I wouldn’t stress as I got closer to my due date. 

How can it be realistic to do a party with 46 people the day before I’m due when we moved our birthday parties 2 weeks early and were fewer people? 

Am I being crazy and unrealistic, or am I somehow right in not wanting a huge party at the house where I live the day before I’m due to give birth? 
In our country it’s tradition for the children to plan a surprise for the parents anniversary, so my in laws are clueless.

Update/clarifying points: 
1. Invites have not already been sent out yet. My husband and his brothers just today finished the guest list and are starting inviting people over the next few days. 
2. I knew already people were going to come, so that isn’t the issue at hand, I had just figured it was a low key gathering. My husband was talking about a party and when I asked he confessed that it was for his parents anniversary and that’s when I found out all the details, such as that the low key gathering was a two day party with 46 guests. 
3. My husband and his brothers had seriously not considered what would happen if I gave birth before my due date, in fact when he asked his older brother he said he didn’t care, that there would still be a party. This makes me very uncomfortable due to the fact that 46 people in the house is a health hazard for a newborn. 
4. My issue isn’t with the party itself but with the amount of guests and the fact that they haven’t planned to hold the party elsewhere. 
5. My in laws don’t know anything about the party because in our country it’s tradition for the children to plan a surprise for their parents wedding anniversary. 
6. My in laws have expressed interest in being present at the hospital when I give birth because this will be their first grandchild. 
7. Going home to a friend is not an option because I moved here from another city 125 km away, only 1 month ago. Travelling that distance is not an option at this point. I also have no family members in this city other than my husband’s family. 
8. On Wednesday I’m 37 weeks along and the government health officials here consider a birth from 37 weeks onward to not be premature. 

FINAL UPDATE: I tipped off my mother in law. And it led to a conversation, with her and I but also she talked with my husband (just the two of them) and I think she and my husband and my father in law also talked to his brothers. There’s now a plan B in place, whether I go into labour during the two days of festivities, am still at the hospital, or am already home with baby. I feel a lot more comfortable now and I am glad I said something.",info

"title: WIBTA if I asked one specific person not to bring their kids to my wedding?
content: My (26F) fiancé (28M) and I are still in the early stages of wedding planning, so this hasn’t been something we need to directly address yet, but I know it’s been in the back of both our minds.

My fiancé has a stepsister (late 20s F) who is married with three young children, all under ten. My fiancé did not grow up with this stepsister as their parents married after they were both out of the house, and they are not close. His stepsister’s oldest is on the spectrum; he is mostly non-verbal and communicates physically and through grunts and very few words. He is very physically active, stimulating himself by running around his environment (home, restaurant, etc.) and making loud noises. His younger sister wants to play with him, so she follows his lead and runs around making loud noises. Significantly, my fiancé’s stepsister does nothing to try to reign them in or help them behave more appropriately. She makes sure they don’t wander too far, but they are otherwise free to do what they want. This occurs even in crowded restaurants, with the children regularly getting up from the table to walk around the room. The third child is an infant. 

Neither I nor my fiancé have anything against kids in general. We both want kids in the future, and there will be a few other toddlers and young children at the wedding, all of whom we know personally and are much better behaved in public settings. 

Our wedding ceremony will be outdoors, but the reception will be mostly inside, with some limited outdoor space. My fiancé’s stepsister’s children will have room outside to run around, but will likely still disturb the guests, and will not have the space to run around inside the reception area. I am also worried that the two of them playing and being rambunctious will encourage the other children to be join in and cause distraction and potential chaos to both the ceremony and reception. 

WIBTA if I requested that she find other arrangements for her children for the night and risk her declining the invitation to attend the wedding at all? 

TLDR: My fiancé’s stepsister has very loud and active children, whom she allows to run free in their environments. I am worried about the impact that this will have on my wedding and the other children at the wedding, and I do not trust that she would be able to control her children at the event.

Edit: Some people have (reasonably) pointed out that I would be discriminating against the child with autism. While not my intention, I fully understand how that is the conclusion of my actions. My perspective was more on the mother’s ability to provide an alternate form of care instead of allowing her children to “run wild,” but I understand that I do not have a very full understanding of the nuances of his autism and that I may be asking something that is not possible at this point in his development. I appreciate the commenters for pointing this out!",info

WIBTA if I asked to have my own room?

Sorry for format, on mobile. And it's a bit of a long post/rant? Also I know I may sound entitled and I know it's a first world issue, but please read before passing judgment.

So here's how the story sets off, my family begins with me (20nb) my siblings (19f) and (10m) and my parents (37f and 40m)

As of right now I currently share the basement with my sister, and it's one room with a half wall, and that counts as a ""divider"". As of right now she plans to move out in July. I want to stay at my parents house as I pay 425 for rent, and in comparison where I leave I'm not getting that deal anywhere. 

Here's where the issue starts, after my sister moves out my brother has had the idea that the ""second"" (the smaller part of the divided room) part of the room should go to him. He says he wants it for a second 3D printer and PC. He already has a setup in his room and I even gave my old desk to him to he could have a better set up. I, on the other hand, want the room to myself. Reason being is that I've practically had to share a room with my sister since we were 7, besides maybe six months when we moved in but then went back to sharing again. That means we haven't had privacy, none of our own space really. 

Anytime I hear my brother talk about it my parents don't object to anything he says, which makes me think he already has it practically because they would have said something. As of right now he has his own room and has his current PC and 3D printer already set up. 

I've also thought about working from home and that space being used for an office area, and even if I don't work from home still making it an office area for potential study if I go to school one day. I feel just frustrated because I've planned to put in so much work, only to have to share a room again for almost my whole life.

On one hand, I do feel like I have a valid point as 1. I'm the person who handles the most responsibility amongst the kids. 2. I am the oldest and have never really had my own room before. 3. I am offering to update things out of my own pocket and pay rent (not saying I think my brother should pay rent). But on the other hand it is my parents house and what they go really has the final decision, and I can acknowledge and respect that. 

Another reason is my brother has a TON of his friends come over. I'm talking anywhere from 1-6 kids almost daily. Multiple of his friends have broken stuff, trashed out backyard, and I believe taken things without permission. Without a hard barrier I don't want them coming into my room as I have multiple expensive things they can take (Nintendo switch, IPad, oculus, etc) and I don't want that risk either. I've worked hard for all those and don't want a kid to break/take it. 

So, am I the Asshole if I ask to have the room to myself? I feel if I do I could be entitled and rude which would make me the Asshole.",yta
"title: WIBTA if I blocked off my yard from my neighbors?
content: I'm sure this sounds stupid but I'm at my wits end. The houses in our town are very close together. My husband and I are in our mid twenties and own our home. The house next to us is a duplex that semi frequently goes through tenants. The driveway isn't big enough to fit all the cars so they often park a vehicle in the grass between the sidewalk and road, and we don't have curbs in our neighborhood. Well when the neighbors park in front of their house on their strip of grass, they drive through our yard. When they pull in from the driveway they don't back out using the driveway, they just pull through our yard. Sometimes they just pull through our yard when coming home and leave through the driveway. We have asked every new neighbor to not drive in our yard, and have had to ask several times to not do it. We own our home. We take a lot of pride in keeping it looking nice, which includes the yard. I'm tired of having to ask people to not drive in our yard. We don't know the landlord or how to contact them. I also don't want to call the police because I don't want the family who does it to be evicted. The family has three kids and housing is very hard to come by in our town. I want to block off the section of my yard they drive in so they're forced to use their drive way only, and I don't want to put anything that could damage their vehicle. I just want to use standard driveway markers. I've brought it up to my parents and they basically just tell us to get over it.


Update: I looked up online the tax records to find who the owner was. I found his information and got a hold of him. He told me no one should be parking where they are, and that they're supposed to use the regular driveway. He asked which apartment was doing it and I said I wasn't sure. He then said if it keeps happening to call the police as well. He didn't seem too interested in helping any. I'll definitely be looking into other things to do that you all have suggested.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I called a 'family meeting'
content: Throwaway account as I have friends and family on here.

I am a young adult female and eldest daughter at 23. I have a younger sibling of 20.

Our parents divorced when we were both very young (me 7, sibling 4). Staying with my Mom, I got told a lot of what went on in their marriage and what was going on in their divorce and as I got older I got told more of their communications regards us kids and about how difficult he was being. They didnt talk to each other - everything was by email so we never overheard any conversations. Just what we were told . My Dad never said anything about discussions with my Mom and I figured it was because he was usually in the wrong and was being the asshole regards arrangements.

Now that I'm an adult I feel like I've only heard one side of the story and when I did ask my Dad about things (when i was younger) he'd  say ""its nothing for you to worry about, it's adult discussions""

WIBTA if i arranged a meeting for the three of us (not my sibling at this stage) and I sat them down and asked pointed questions about specific memories I have? Like the time my Dad 'didnt want us' while my Mom was away on holiday so we had a babysitter stay with us for a week? That one really hurt and I'd  like for it be brought up where theres no ""he said she said"" and I can maybe get some closure on what it did to me? Why didn't he want me? Why wouldnt he take care of me while Mom was away? 

Your opinions would be appreciated.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I confronted my friends about this?
content: Hey so I’m actually not sure if the post is appropriate for this group but I have a dilemma and Idk if I’m overreacting/ if I would be an asshole if I decided to address this with my friends. 

So for context I am a student (25f in medicine) and I am also the only black person (there are multiple other races in the group) in the friend circle. My friends are your social justice/ SJW type so the topic of race does come up a lot. I don’t usually engage all that much and prefer to listen since I am a bit center left than my friends. 

So here’s what happened. Today we were all spending time together after an event and the word “cracker” started being used in a joking manner. Now I have no idea if that’s a slur but that not even the point. They (a white person) started saying that someone called them a cracker in a joking manner and one of my friends (not white) started joking saying “oh did they say it with the hard r or the a”. And everyone just laughed about it while I sat there quietly. And then they started to imitate saying “cracker/ cracka” as if they were imitating saying the n-word (not in a derogatory way but in this context you could essentially replace one word for another-obviously the n word is worse). For example, “oh are you a crackeR or a cracka “ and “as a cracka etc”  continuing the joke in different contexts/ examples. 

The reason it made me so uncomfortable was because it felt like casual racism (I don’t even know if it could be defined as such but it just made me feel very weird) because I obviously could tell it was a play on the n-word and the way it is more offensive to say the hard R and is friendly (in the black community) to say it with the “a” instead. 
And I’m aware that it wasn’t directed towards me or that it was even malicious in the friend setting but it did made me feel really uncomfortable and I don’t know if I would be an asshole/ overdramatic if I brought it up to the group. 

The more I think about it the more it makes me feel uncomfortable- it felt like it made a mockery of the the n-word and I’m not too sure what to do.

"title: WIBTA if I did not go to my brother's wedding because he made an exception to the no kids rule for my sister's kids but not mine?
content: My brother is having a destination wedding later this year and specified that this will be a no kids wedding. My sister and I both have young kids around the same age. He said that because my sister won't have anyone to look after her kids so they will be allowed to attend the wedding. He assumed my wife's parents can watch our kids so our kids are not allowed. I'm finding this to be very unfair to the point that I'm thinking of not attending the wedding at all. We are pretty close and I would be in the wedding party if I do go so WIBTA to not attend at all? My wife has also given me the option of attending by myself but I would feel weird being there without my family.

Edit: just some clarification cause I see a lot of repeating questions.
1). No, we do not have childcare. My in-laws are the only ones we trust to watch the kids and they've had a rough year with sick family members. They have exhausted all their vacation days at work and my wife does not want to burden them with watching our kids for multiple days because this is a weekday destination wedding. 
2) our kids are not more rowdy or misbehave more than my sister's kids so it's not a case that they don't want our kids there because they think they'll disrupt the wedding. 
3) yes, I will talk to my brother about our situation and see what he says. I was just frustrated that he assumed what our situation is with childcare without asking.

Edit 2: this wedding will be held at a place where no childcare services will be available. Think of a very touristy city, but not the type with resorts and stuff. Also, we have let my brother know of our situation and are still waiting to hear back.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I didn't give my sister and her husband financial help?
content: This is regarding my sister (age 25) and her husband (age 26). Neither of them have jobs. They try to be Youtube stars or content creators or whatever but they earn almost nothing from Youtube, instagram or pateron. They relied on my parents and his parents (mostly) to support them, or social assistance. His parents have more money than my parents. From what I understand his parents said enough and cut my sister and her husband off when they retired and downsized. My parents are still helping them out and I think maybe others from my family or his (like grandparents or my uncle) but I don't know for sure. I was never bothered about giving them money because I was a student and didn't have any extra money.

The game has changed because my sister is pregnant. My sister and her husband as well as my parents, asked me (age 29) for money because of the baby. Since last year I'm not a student anymore. I'm working and I don't have debt. I'm being asked since his parents cut them off. They know about the baby but are holding firm. There's nothing wrong with my sister and her husband that they can't work so normally I'd tell them to shove off but I'm being pressured to be a helpful sister because of the baby. I could afford to help a little and I'm not sure if I'd be the asshole if I didn't because now there is a baby. I'm honestly not sure if I'd be the asshole here.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I didnt want to translate for my parents?
content: I (35F) was supposed to go on a trip to Japan with my girlfriend of 8 years this fall. However I just found out she was cheating on me, so I dumped her ass and decided I’d still do the trip myself. I am not Japanese but am fluent, and went to and graduated from a Japanese university. My now-ex and I hadn’t paid for any of the trip yet, so I was going to hit up some of my college friends and ask to couch surf my way through the trip. If they said can’t stay with me, no big deal, I can afford hotels, and I’d still ask if any wanted to meet up with me for parts of the trip where I was nearby. I wanted to pick some things to do that I never got a chance to do while living there, like go to Tokyo DisneySea or visit Hiroshima. I also wanted to go back to a few smaller/more obscure Shinto shrines i visited while I was a student to pay respects to where I prayed since I was in and survived the Tohoku earthquake. Basically cross off a bunch of mostly less touristy/less popular things on my bucket list. 

Anyway, my parents ask me this morning if, rather than me going alone (not that they’re worried about me traveling alone, even though I’m a woman and blind) if I’d be willing to turn the trip into something for the three of us. My dad is turning 70 and doesn’t think he can do international trips much longer, and my parents own friends aren’t adventurous enough for Japan (we are American). They came on my last trip for my school reunion 6 years ago and said it was the best trip they’d ever taken. I booked everything, planned everything, translated, etc. and it was absolutely exhausting.

It’s one thing to spend two weeks in your non native language, it’s another to constantly have to be working and translating back and forth- plus my parents aren’t nerds so they wouldn’t want to do things like Odaiba or the Eorzea Cafe, things on my own bucket list. That and they’re constantly complaining about my weight and scrutinizing everything I eat. I’m already trying to minimize contact because the conversation is always why I don’t have a better job (I’m blind, try finding better work in an accessible area that will hire a visibly blind person!) or why I’m so fat/what my weight is. They’re offering to pay part of my trip if I take it with them, but really I a) am not rich but saved up enough to do this for myself, so while not having to pay for a lot of the trip is nice I’m not sure it’s worth the hassle and b) I kind of want a quiet two weeks this fall after a really messy breakup after an 8 year relationship. WIBTA if I told my parents no, even if it meant my dad can’t go back to Japan ever again?",nta
"title: WIBTA if I didn’t go to my brother’s high school graduation because he waited days to reach out to me when I was in the hospital?
content: EDIT: A lot of people seem to skipping over the fact that I already said I planned to talk to my brothers. I never said I was just going to quietly bail. 

Also,

**UPDATE: Went to the doctor yesterday. Will definitely need that next medical procedure I mentioned and the next available date is in about 2 weeks and is 2 days after my brother’s graduation. However, my return flight is for 4 days after the graduation and flying back sooner would be way too expensive at this point. If I were to reschedule this procedure, I’d have to wait a month for the next available appointment (instead of 2 weeks). I’m torn. It’s a big event I’m missing, but I don’t think delaying medical care is a good idea.**

I (26F) went to the hospital for stroke-like symptoms 2 months ago. I ended up being admitted for 3 days and didn’t hear anything from my 2 brothers (17 and 18) during my entire hospital stay. I spent my hospital stay depressed because of that. By the time they reached out to me, I was already discharged. 

At first, I was just happy they reached out at all. But as I thought about it more, I began to feel hurt that they couldn’t even take 2 seconds to send me a text during those days I was hospitalized. I live across the country and we don’t really talk much on a day to day, but I feel like reaching out to an immediate family member in a timely manner after an emergency is the bare minimum. Come to think of it, they haven’t reached out to me after other medical procedures I’ve had either, even after I told them the date. 

I haven’t brought this up to them yet because I tend to bottle up my feelings (I’m working on that). Plus there is a long history of my family (my mother in particular) invalidating me any time I confront my brothers about anything, which has led them to lack a sense of accountability. In fact, it’s a major reason I moved out. 

Either way, it’s eating away at me and I’m not sure I’ll be able to let this go. I’m thinking of confronting them, and if they don’t apologize or they get snippy, I won’t go. 

Besides, it would be a stretch financially. I have a ton of medical debt and also need to save as much as I can because I work a toxic job and am looking to quit soon. Also, I could have another medical procedure on the horizon that may conflict with the graduation (I find out later today). For now, I’ve already booked the plane ticket and told my mother I would go. But I paid a little extra so I could get a refund if needed. 

So all things considered, would I be the asshole if I didn’t go to my brother’s graduation?",nta

I never saw her as a mother figure, and she has been very rude to me on a few occasions.

"title: WIBTA if I don't want my mom come when I spread my fathers ashes?
content:  I 25 F, lost my dad in February 2023.  
My dad has 2 kids, me and my brother 17M, he wasn’t married or had any other close relatives. 

So due to the law I’m the guardian of everything involving his assets and funeral. We had the funeral and he wanted to be spread over the ocean instead of a normal burial. That’s fine, and I want to grant that.   
My brother was involved in the funeral planning, along side with my mother; due to my brother not being legal of age. 

But here is the kicker:

My mom wants to be there when we spread his ashes, with the excuse of “We were married for 17 years prior to this”.   
My mom and dad got divorced 16 years ago and hasn’t been able to be in the same room as my dad ever since. My dad didn’t have a problem with her. (My mom almost cancelled coming to my graduation, due to my dad being invited)  
They haven’t really spoken or been in contact in 10 + years + my brother never had a relationship with him growing up. She only has bad things to say about him, and I never heard anything nice from her about our dad growing up. 

I also have a very turbulent relationship with my mom, due to her previous alcoholism and behavior. And to this day she and I have a very tense relationship and I have gone low contact with her – I only really call/text when I want to see my brother. 

We are going to spread the ashes in a month time, and I really don’t want my mom to be there. And actually want to tell her she isn’t welcome.    
I can’t see the reason for her to be there since she didn’t care about him when he was alive.

"title: WIBTA if I don’t get my best friend a B-Day gift
content: So I (24F) feel like I shouldn’t bother getting my friend (23F) a b-day gift this year or even try to acknowledge it and i’ll explain.

Me and my friend have been friends for like 7-8 years. We were our first ever actually close friends that talk outside of high school. So of course, we usually acknowledge both of our birthdays every year and when we aren’t busy plan a day to hangout and celebrate and exchange our gifts. But this year is different. 

She has been an online dating/long distance person for the longest (usually meeting them through discord for a game), but she is in her first ever close distance relationship where she can actually kiss, hug, talk, ect with this person face to face. She lost her virginity to this dude and after 4-5 months of them being together they are already living together, paying 50/50, and letting him drive her car since his truck to broke down. It has just been him,him,him lately and I just back away since I want nothing to do with the dude. Moving in his apartment with only like 5 months in is just wild to me, but I don’t want to say anything rude and be the bad guy.

Anyways, Boom!, my birthday comes and I wake up to no text message/gif from her. Just family messages wishing happy birthday. I went through my day normally, but I would glance at my phone multiple times throughout the day hoping to get a message from her. She’s a nurse so i’m like “Maybe it’s a busy day or something”. Toward the end of my bday, nothing. I felt a little hurt. She forgot my birthday. Now, I am a petty and a slight grudge holding person. Plus, my friend is known to make fun of me over my memory while she has the memory of a elephant (Guess not anymore since she got a bf now). If I were to forget her bday, I wouldn’t hear the end of it.

So the next day comes and she send some tiktok. I asked “Random question: what did you do all day yesterday?” She answer, “Oh just spending the whole day with my bf at the fishing shop and etc”. I then asked, “k, so nothing important happened yesterday?” After a few minute then she text about forgetting my bday and how she was so sorry. The only time we hung out after that is to see her bf’s place and talk about her relationship. 

Yesterday, I saw something that I thought she would have liked for a birthday gift, but then I thought “Why bother she didn’t get me anything”. So this is where I am stuck and want other opinions. I personally don’t want to get anything bc I feel like it wouldn’t be fair to be “HAPPY BIRTHDAY🎉🎉🎂🎂” like we usually do with gifts and everything when I didn’t get that fanfare for my bday. Is it selfish of me to feel that way? 

TLDR:: Best friend of 7-8 years forgets my birthday. I feel like I shouldn’t have to get her anything and treat it like any other day just like her, eye for an eye. AITA?",yta
"title: WIBTA if I don’t wish my birth father a “Happy Father’s Day”?
content: I (32M) have always had a strained relationship with my father. He and my mother divorced when I was around 3 and I split time between them as a child but spent more time with my mother. 

As a child, my father spent a lot of time bashing my mother and badmouthing her, along with spending a large amount of time drunk and high on who knows what. He is an admitted alcoholic and drug addict, having done hard drugs from his teen years through his 40s until his body started shutting down (around the time that I was 16). He did not have much money due to child support and his habits that he fueled (not important to be but important for context).

8 years ago, in 2015, I was admitted to a psychiatric facility and he refused to visit because he said “he could not handle seeing me like that” and I essentially stopped having much contact with him after that. My mother has encouraged me to keep the line of communication open despite everything because she doesn’t want me to have any regrets. 

He is 63 now and we do not have much of a relationship. He has memory issues so I have never felt like it was worth mentioning any of my issues with him. We do not have much in common and phone calls/visits are a struggle. He has almost died 3 times and I’ve had to see him admitted to many hospitals because of his reckless decisions. 

Recently, we had a phone call where he voluntarily declared he “didn’t feel like he was meant to be a parent and he didn’t feel like he had done a very good job of raising me.” I asked him if there were any regrets he felt like addressing given that statement, as I felt like maybe he was in poor health or something and wanted to open that dialogue (finally). 

He replied with “No, not really.”

No acknowledgement that he’s proud of who I’ve become, and no apology or ownership for any of his behavior. 

With Father’s Day next month in the US, I’m considering just not acknowledging the day and just letting it pass. He does not feel like he was meant to be a dad - should I just send a simple text on the day? WIBTA if I just don’t say anything?",nta
"title: WIBTA if I excluded another woman from our informal women's group?
content: I need some perspective on this.

I'm 30s (F) along with a group of 6 women started meeting about 2 times a month to talk about our careers, politics, and feminism. While we began to discuss our careers, we've also become friends who debate whether or not we could 'have it all' and how to balance ambition and family.

A while back, our friend brought an acquaintance ""Mandy"" to join and if I'm honest - I  became very annoyed by her. Mandy works at a dysfunctional job, supports her deadbeat boyfriend who treats her like a piggy bank, and seems to always be taken advantage of by her family, coworkers, and friends. Despite our constant encouragement, coaching, and job recommendations Mandy can't seem to set boundaries and advocate for herself or take our suggestion of therapy seriously. When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.

It became a herculean effort for me to not snap at her when she did that.

A month ago, I sent out a group e-mail saying I can't make the group anymore due to time constraints and that I wish everyone the best. I am the first woman to decide to leave the group. One friend ""Kate"" reached out and in private I told her that it got to a point where I dread going and having to hear Mandy talk about how depressed she is and how nothing in her life is going well. Kate listened to me and confided that she also felt like she lacked compassion and was a 'bad feminist' for not being able to hold space for Mandy.

We made plans to hang out and when we did Kate showed up with everyone from the women's group except for Mandy. We've been meeting again, and to my understanding everyone just white lied about obligations to Mandy. Yesterday, I received a group e-mail from ""Mandy"" talking about how upset she was that the group disbanded and how she felt like she lost her only support system.

Am I the Asshole for excluded another Mandy from our informal women's group?

Edit: Not sure where the idea that we're an emotional support group stems from, but we're not a women's emotional support group. Our meetings are generally geared around navigating our professional careers and financial investments as women. None of us are licensed therapists.

"title: WIBTA if I forbid a worker to enter my bedroom, making his job harder?
content: Hi, I (F) live alone in an apartment. The one thing that I don't like about this place is that the back door is directly in my bedroom. So everytime someone knock at my backdoor, it feels like they are knocking on my bedroom door. It's annoying and it make me feel unsafe but it isn't the fault of anyone implicated in this situation. 

The owner called me today to tell me that, tomorrow at 7 am someone will come to adjust the railing of my balconies (I live on the second floor). The front balcony has a door in my living room and doesn't have a street access so they need to come inside to access it. While I feel invaded while strangers are in my home, I understand it is needed. 

Last year, someone painted and did some work on the balconies (I'm pretty sure it will be the same person tomorrow too). He started on the back balcony and, naturally, he wanted to go through my apartment to cross from one balcony to the other, going through my bedroom in the process. I asked him to please go through the front door as it make me feel uncomfortable to have strangers in my bedroom. He seemed annoyed and insisted. While I understand that it must be frustrating for him to go have go through the front, especially with the stairs, I stood my ground.

Last year, I don't think my request was that bad since he only had a small toolbox and a can of paint to carry. But tomorrow, since he's doing some adjustments on the railing I assume he will have some materials to carry and the stair to my back balcony is a spiral one. He will surely ask to cross inside.

I don't have anything to hide in my bedroom but I feel worse about the idea of a stranger in my room than in the rest of my home.

 So, if I don't let him cross, it would make me feel less uncomfortable about the situation but it will make his job harder. WIBTA if I impose that boundary?",yta

**Additional context:** I’m not invited for the Disney trip which I’m okay with but the mother has some territorial and exclusionary habits. She’ll ask to do things as a family and will leave me out on purpose, I’m okay with it but I don’t want people to think I’m doing this to be petty.

Stepson in brackets because his dad and I have been together for 3 years, not married. 

Ever since the PS5 came out he’s been asking for it. He’s been asking a lot more in the past months with his birthday coming up.

He is going to Disney with his mother (and my partner) and getting a phone from my partner and a few other gifts. But he wants the PS5.

If I got it as a gift WIBTA or would it be seen as competing with his mother?",nta
"title: WIBTA if I kept food in a mini fridge in my bedroom?
content: I (23F) live in my apartment with my roommate, W (22M). We moved in a few months ago, due to being kicked out of his parents house. From December-January, he worked. Got fired. Had a part time job in March, quit in 2 weeks. Needless to say, he hasn’t paid me since February. I’m fine with him staying here, cleaning, until he’s able to pay me back. It also means he’s not paying for food. That hasn’t been an issue, u til recently. 

My roommate loves eggs. I didn’t buy them when they were $4-5 carton, but when they went down, I bought 36 in hopes to have them a few weeks. Well, he ate I believe 16 by himself in under a week. I was pretty peeved, I spoke to him about it, and he let up. Until this week. 

Important note: I have a mini fridge in storage to use. 


I bought an 18 pack last Friday, and he stated Tuesday he’d used a whole row. Said he’s let up. I look this morning and I’m left with 5. So, I have a mini fridge that sits on a desk and I was going to put the remaining eggs in there and any future eggs in there. I don’t care about buying him food, but he clearly didn’t listen the first time we talked about it. So, WIBTA?

Small edit: He claims it’s because it’s a hyperfixation of his, which I understand, but claims he can’t help it.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I kick out my renter's over garbage?
content: Context: I'm a single woman and have been renting out a room in my basement for several years.  Last year I decided to renovate the basement to include a kitchen downstairs, creating minimal shared space for more privacy. The exception is the laundry, which is located next to the basement kitchen (same room), and my storage area which is in the next room. I generally only go downstairs for a few minutes a couple times a week to access these things, so while it's not a private apartment, it's a lot more private and seperate than your typical roomate situation.
My newest renters are a college couple that moved in in January. They have not cleaned ONCE since they got here - it is now mid-May. They leave garbage in open boxes and bags. The stove is covered in old food splatters. The floor is covored in hair. They never once emptied the lint trap of the dryer despite multiple warnings that this is a fire hazard and constantly cover the dryer in dishes making the lint trap difficult to access when I do laundry. 
I have had multiple conversations with them about this and have started sending messages in writing but so far nothing has helped. Even though I'm not down there often, I'm disgusted every time I have to do laundry, plus with all the old food it's just a matter of time before they attract bugs, especially now that it's spring. They are on a month to month, so I could tell them that I won't renew after next month, which would give them more than the 30 days notice required. I've never done that before, but I don't know what else to do! It feels dramatic since 1 hour of cleaning would solve the problem but I'm not their mother or their maid and I can't keep being disgusted every time I do laundry. WIBTA? Is there anything else I can do to get through to them just how gross and unacceptable this is so they clean up their act - literally?",info
"title: WIBTA if I left my brother's daughter baptism celebration early.
content: I made plans to go to a baseball game with a friend from out of state on July 23th last month. I was talking to mom yesterday and she was talking about how our uncle was coming down to see a baseball game on July 22nd. I said oh that is cool, I am going to the game the day after. Which then she informed me that my brother's daughter baptism is on that day, which I am the god parent. I knew about the baptism but not the date because the evite was sent to my wife and not me.

The baptism is at 10 and then they have a celebration afterwards. The baseball game is at 1. I would never of made plans to  have my friend come from out of state to a baseball game if I realized that the baptism was on the same day. I called my brother up to try explain the situation and see if he would be okay if I was there for the baptism and left early during the lunch or if not, Ill tell my friend that I have to cancel the plans and would pay for the tickets that my friend bought as a gift. My brother told me he doesn't give a shit about the friend out of state and that he no longer wants me to be the godfather. I'm I the asshole and I'm I being too inconsiderate and too entitled in this situation.

"title: WIBTA if I let wealthy relations pay for my dinner when we are going out for my mother's birthday and I'm paying for her share as a gift.
content: For my mother's birthday we decided to go to a fancy and rather expensive restaurant. I offered to pay for her part of it as her birthday present. I don't currently have a job as I have long Covid (had to give up my career and move back to my home country because of it), but I have an extremely small weekly income and some saved money. The dinner is something I have budgeted for, not easy, but doable.   
When I booked the table I booked for 4 people to allow her to invite friends (the friends paying for themselves), although the friends she originally planned to invite were unavailable. She later decided to invite wealthy relatives of ours instead. These relatives have a lot of money and like to play host. My mother goes out with them quite often, and after a point I know they started to have tussles over who would pay the bill. My mother earns very good money and is proud, but doesn't have anything like their wealth. 

Now my mother is saying that I need to make sure that these relatives only pay for themselves for this dinner, otherwise my ""gift"" to her isn't really a gift. I fully expected to make sure I pay for her as I said I would, and I have already paid for a $165 bottle of champagne to be open on the table for everyone when we arrive. 

I really don't see why I can't let them pay for my share if they insist. I feel like this is about her pride, and currently I don't have much pride when it comes to money after being so sick for 3+ years. They are my relatives too, and I don't have her resources. 

So WIBTA if I let our very wealthy relatives pay for my share (not hers) of her birthday dinner?",nah
"title: WIBTA if I played “Another One Bites the Dust” at my brother’s wake?
content: My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it’s stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn’t Catholic and wouldn’t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn’t know there. He’d think it’s way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while “It’s Raining Men” played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like “Highway to Hell” and “Another One Bites the Dust.” 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play “Another One Bites the Dust” at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren’t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I’ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I didn’t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don’t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn’t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother’ s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we’re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

Thanks again.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I privately asked my MIL and BIL via text to wash their hands after they use the restroom when they come over?
content: My MIL and BIL came over for dinner like we usually have planned, my MIL used the restroom and I ask her if she enjoyed the smell of the soap (bought new soap that smells really good and wanted other’s opinion). She replied back saying “Oh no, I didn’t wash my hands”. I proceeded to shrivel up and die inside because that’s absolutely disgusting and also realizing it’s been like that the past 5 years. And yes, I made her go back and wash her hands but I wasn’t mean about it. Fiancé was just as horrified as myself.

For context, my MIL and BIL are not clean people, they live in a very dirty home so I can’t say I’m super surprised. I got a rash on my face when I newly started dating my now fiancé because MIL’s house is so full of dirt, pet hair, dust, mold and God knows what else. I have to take an allergy pill to go over there and have a new allergy to pet dander. Thanks guys. 

My mother said it’s not appropriate for me or my fiancé to say anything. But figured I’d reach out to the people of Reddit because that’s just so disgusting and unsanitary and my fiancé and I DO NOT live in filth like they do. 

The idea was just to send a message via text so if she’s embarrassed I’m not embarrassing her in person in front of others.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I put a cardboard cutout in my bathroom to scare my boyfriend if he uses it?
content: Hello, I (23F) live with my boyfriend (22M) in a townhouse with another roommate. 

We each have our own bathroom and pay equal share of the rent, but since my bathroom is closer to our bedrooms (and my toilet has a bidet) he likes to use mine instead of his. 

I know this is a really trivial argument, but I really want to be the only person using my bathroom. I have always had to share a bathroom with others and being able to have a bathroom that is my own was liberating for me. I’ve been asking him to please limit using my bathroom to when he’s working (he works from home and sometimes needs to get back to his computer quickly) but he won’t stop using it. A few weeks earlier, he got really sick and I had to essentially beg him to stop using it because he’s contagious. He even used the shower to take a bath while very courageous because “the temperature works better.” He also left water all over the floor near the shower and the curtains still hanging out the wrong side. 

Last night, when I woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick, he was in there using my bathroom so I went downstairs to use his, only for him to come down and say he needs to use his shower. Why didn’t he just use his own bathroom in the first place?! 

I know this is stupid and trivial, but I just want to know if I’m making a big deal out of essentially nothing. My bathroom does not have a lock, so I’ve been considering trying to have one more heart to heart about the issue and then buying a cardboard cut out to surprise people if they open the bathroom door.

"title: WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?
content: My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care. 

I’m in Australia, and I’m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

"title: WIBTA if I refused to attend my cousins wedding after she asked me to dye my ginger hair?
content: Yes I'm aware that my cousin posted here and oh the irony as i showed her this sub last year, but I really don't care if she sees this,  maybe it'll hammer the point home. 
And I doubt she will see it as they are currently on their pre wedding honeymoon, legit didn't even know those were a thing. 
So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. 
People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. 
What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.
maybe slightly more [ginger] (https://ibb.co/w4yrCCk) in low light
This whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.

My [hair](https://ibb.co/y4dKsCZ) [2]
(https://ibb.co/3BVPgBf) [3](https://ibb.co/MD1V7NH) is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. 
Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.
Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.
She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.
My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.

At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. 

After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.
My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. 

My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. 
[these](https://www.frenchnovelty.com/sean-couture-peacock-corset-back-ball-gown-prom-dress-70567) are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.
I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. 
But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. 
She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.

WIBTA if I just say fuck it and stay home.
EDIT  also to be fair i dyed a small strand underneath to test how it washed out 4 weeks ago, it is STILL DARK BROWN",nta
"title: WIBTA if I said something about the way my mom treats my dad.
content: So basically my mom and brother randomly make rude comments towards my dad for no reason. Today he was laughing at something my brother said that everyone else in my family was also laughing at, my mom and brother both looked at him and said what are you laughing at. They both started laughing even more and my dad got quiet. I wanted to say something but I don’t know how to handle the situation. I feel like if I say something they will both just gang up on me but I love my dad and I’m tired of them treating him like this. They also sometimes make comments like “what is he even saying” when my dad talks.
Another thing my mom does is, she yells at my dad whenever messes anything up or forgets something. My dad is very patient and reserved so he doesn’t argue back he just agrees with whatever she says.
I feel like my mom and brother are causing him to be more reserved than he already is because whenever it’s just me and him alone he talks a lot more. My grandpa on my moms side treated my grandma like this and I’m scared he passed that behavior onto my mom which she passed onto my brother. 
I don’t know if saying something would make the situation worse or if it would help give my dad the voice he lost. Thank you for reading, please let me know what you think.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?
content: I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",nta

"title: WIBTA if I told my husband to stay out of my room?
content: We recently moved into a large house. Before moving, it was agreed between my husband and I that we would each have our own space besides our shared bedroom. He gets the office and very large deck off of it for his exclusive use and I get the sunroom for the same. 

We’ve been here about 6 weeks now and it is not shaking out that way at all. He doesn’t use the office or deck, even to work.

He stays up late watching TV and falls asleep on the couch. He has sleep apnea and snores horribly without his mask so he says he doesn’t want to come to bed and disturb me while I’m sleeping. He won’t come to bed earlier or set his machine up so he can come to bed when he’s ready without the fuss and fumbling around in the dark.  Then in the early morning he comes into our bedroom and asks to sleep in my sunroom. 

I don’t want him to, that’s supposed to be my space, but I feel like an AH if I say no.  I am a person that needs time to myself and quiet just to be at an ok level. I like my space to be organized, clean and smell nicely and just the way I want it. I’ve given up on that for the rest of the house (though I do try, I’ve accepted it will never happen with 5 people home all day).  But it IS the best space in the house, I understand why he wants to be in there. I decorated it with great care. His office he has done nothing to but buy a cheap futon that he hates. I’ve offered to decorate it for him but he doesn’t answer me. 


Some possibly pertinent information- he works from home and is by far the primary earner. I have a small online shop that is currently taking a break while we settle into the new house. It will be based from the sunroom June 1st.  We have three homeschooled children, which I am the primary caregiver/educator for (those their main curriculum is online). We also have two young puppies that I get up with at night and in the morning. (He usually lets them out late at night and then puts them in their crates for the night).

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I told my husband no, he can’t sleep in my space?

content: My mom (Linda 72F) is a widow of several years and is super active. She has a big friend group that she dines out with, she gardens, sews, goes to baseball games, plays games, is in a card club, hikes, goes boating, travels with friends, etc. She is living her best life. She sometimes gets so engrossed in what she is doing that she ignores her phone for hours. My sister (Denise) recently tried to reach her and panicked when it took 4-5 hours for my mom to call her back (she had gone to brunch with friends and then to a baseball game).

My mom is very healthy and shows no signs of dementia (she’s in better shape that a lot of people half her age), but my sister freaked out. A few weeks later Denise texted me and my other sister (Kara) that she had added all three of us to my mom’s phone tracking. When I asked Denise if my mom was OK with that, she told me that she had asked my mom and my mom said no, but Denise decided to add us anyway. Kara and I both said we didn’t feel comfortable having access when our mom explicitly didn’t want us to. We told Denise that we were deleting our access and encouraged her to do the same.

It’s been a week and Denise still hasn’t removed the access on her phone. Would I be the AH if I told my mom about it? It feels wrong to know my sister is spying on her against her wishes but I also don’t want to cause drama in the family.

"title: WIBTA if I took my son and his friends out for his birthday instead of my wife and step-daughters?
content: I (m42) have three kids. A son Isaac (12 almost 13) with my ex who is no longer in the picture and twin step-daughters from my wife’s previous relationship; Emma and Ava (7). 

Isaac’s 13th birthday is coming up next week, and he said that he wants to go to the movies, and asked if he could bring two friends along. I agreed, and we planned a day out of fun (arcade, pizza, and a movie). These were all activities that I know that my son and his friends (nerdy middleschool boys) would enjoy. 

When I told my wife about our plans, she suggested that we should have a family outing instead, and proposed a local kiddy playplace that my step-daughters apparently love. I said that Isaac and his friends would be very disappointed, and that he wouldn’t have fun at the kiddy playplace. 

She tried to convince me that Isaac could still have fun because there was an ‘arcade’ (two claw machines, a pinball table, and a small DDR machine). She also said that, since he sees his friends at school everyday, family time should be prioritized over friends. 

I told her that it was unfair to force Isaac to spend his birthday at a kiddy playplace instead of with his friends. She accused me of favoritism and of not loving my step-daughters as much Isaac. This hit me pretty hard because I grew up with a step-father who neglected me in favor of his own kids, and I’ve been trying my hardest to be the father figure I never had.

Anywho, I had an idea about an actual school newspaper, including things like the meals for each day and trips coming up, study skills/motivation (in different sections) and such, and to update it every week online (because everyone has access to laptops and Wi-Fi at school). I thought it was a good idea and wanted to see it put into motion and then I was told that a grade above me planned a school newspaper earlier and were just sorting things out. I was bummed, but I didn’t want to basically steal the X chronicles from them. So I let it go.


They didn’t do anything about it for months. Until the end of the year when the principal said they’d print 1 newspaper for each classroom. Well, she left and the new principal denied the idea. I feel bad about it being denied but I feel like if I tried to do it my way, we’d be saving paper and everyone would have access to the news on their own at any time.

"title: WIBTA if I went over my friend's head and try to educate her autistic son for being fatphobic
content: (English is not first language. Ask me if anything is unclear)

I (33f) have a very good friend (35f) - let's call her F - and I am the godmother of her son (4m) - I'll call him S - who is on the spectrum (mild). We are very close and I help her whenever I can, either taking care of S or changing plans to accomodate her/them when our friend group go out.

I suffer from body dismorfia my entire life which led me to serious self steem issues and swinging from anorexia to currently obesity (yes, I do go to therapy). This is a very sensitive topic to me. 

The three of us were at hers yesterday and she started blabbing about how her dog was fat because it ate too much and now it would have to go in a diet (she repeated several times how fat it was) and I immediately disapproved but failed to stop her as I am always afraid to seem oversensitive on this issue.

A minute later, S sat on my side and stated that I have eaten too much. I knew exactly what he meant but F asked why. And he explained that it was because I am fat and said that all fat people are ugly. I was MORTIFIED! I felt so humiliated seeing a 4-year-old that I love so much telling me those things. She just said to him that they've talked about it, people come in all shapes and it is fine. The thing is this was not the first time he did this to me and F just said the same thing. She never said to him he shouldn't say those things to people. I brushed it off the first time, but didn't this time.

I asked her If she had talked to him. She said yes, but was really vague about it. I think she lied, I think she didn't and won't. Contexto: she has been lying to us often lately, mostly out of shame. She is going through a messy divorce, the ex husband is trying to get them out of the apartment they live in, and she feels embarrassed for some ""wrong"" decisions she has been taking. I NEVER shame her for her struggles (I really mean never) but she feels bad anyway and lies even about very silly things and I think that calling her BS on this would make it worse. She is not doing well.

Finally, WIBTA if I talk to S myself? I think someone has to. For me, so I don't have to go through this again, but obviously for him. I think it's important someone tell him that these things may hurt people's feelings and are not acceptable.

Edit: omg, sorry for not making it clear. I am in no way mad with the kid, guys! I know where this kind of things come from and that's why I think it should be addressed. But not to shame him in any way

Edit2: Thank you, guys. I can see I was definitely overreacting and probably using it as an excuse to be invasive (I find her parenting style a bit frustrating sometimes. But hey, not my business!) 
I would totally be the AH",ywbta
"title: WIBTA if i told my brother to find somewhere else to live?
content:  Some context - This is not my blood sibling, it is my best friends little brother. I am close with the family as i have been for years. Recently the youngest brother (15 at the time 16 now,) had been told by his farther he had to move out. I took him in to my house and financially supported him til he managed to aquire a benefit to help towards bills ect.  
He doesn't help around the house unless forced and I found out a little while after taking him in he had been stealing of off my partner and myself, only little things but stealing is stealing. At the time I was angry and told him to find other arrangements to live, however he didn't really try hard and found nowhere.  
Upon this happening I gave him a second chance. The chance included a list of basic rules to adhere to, contributing to the house cleaning, times to turn his tele off at night so he isn't using power all night, no stealing ect;  
Since this he has failed to follow majority of the rules, including still taking things without asking, (I smoke which is legal in my state and he has been stealing little amounts on the regular, which I don't mind giving it to him he has an addiction that we are trying to squash, but its the fact he doesn't ask just takes then won't mention it unless called out.)  
So I'm thinking of telling him he has to find somewhere else to live, I work full-time as does my partner and we are having to lock doors and have safes in our own house. I also feel that by allowing him to stay after blatantly and purposefully breaking rules that I will just be encouraging the behaviour. Neither of his parents want to take him in even though his farther is in a position where he has extra rooms at the house, the finances to be able to ect and they are all guilting me into letting him stay which is why i gave him the chance the first time. It's causing unnecessary stress in my household between me and my partner and stress in general as I am cleaning up my mess, my partners and now his even though he is at home all day everyday.  
So reddit would I be the asshole if I told him he needs to find other living arrangements over the nect 6 weeks and would I be the asshole if last time repeats itself and he makes no effort and ends up with nowhere and I still kicked him out?",info
"title: WIBTA if i told my friend that her missing my birthday hurt me?
content: Okay so its my 18th birthday this week (yay finally legal!) and this birthday is really important to me because since the past two years i have been preparing for a strenuous entrance exam and as a result this would be my first proper party since.

My friend, lets call her A  (17F) has been a really close friend for 4 years and she knows literally everything about my life. She is great friend in general and i love spending time with her but she can be a little flaky sometimes. So she is in arts and we haven't met that much in these last two years. I was really looking forward to us finally meeting and actually partying. She told me that she was excited too.  Cue to yesterday, i sent the invites to everyone and told them to confirm asap. A messages me saying she cannot make it as she is going to dinner with her parents, so i tell her that the party is from 7:30 pm to 11:30 pm so she could drop by anytime. A then tells me that she still can""t make it cause her other friends are coming over at 12 am.  She then said if we could do meet during the day on 11th but at that point i was kinda annoyed at her and plus i was going over to my grandparents house. Honestly, i know this sounds very selfish of me but i really really wanted her to attend just cause we have so much fun together and its a milestone birthday, shes been one of my bestfriend for 4 years and she could easaily just do dinner with her parents on any other day, her parents literally wouldn't mind.  a part of me even thinks that the dinner is just an excuse. she asked me if i was mad at her or something and i said that it was fine. WIBTA if i told her im hurt?   

ETA: Since a lot of people are asking, i did tell her about the party like a month ago and she knew the timing and the date too the only thing that was unclear was the venue just because we could not reserve the venue so early.",nta
"title: WIBTA if i told my mom that our money issues are her fault?
content: My mom is constantly saying that she doesn't have enough money for things, and that we all need to save up our money. But my mom is the one who keeps spending money without any kind of caution. She always gets my baby sisters McDonald's and pizzahut almost every time they ask for it. She wanted a bigger mattress, but did no research and got one that's actually smaller. She bought an outdoor playset for my sisters, because they looked sad with all their toys and tv. She buys comforters almost every month. And she paid a little over $1000 for my brother and sister to go learn MMA, but she never takes them on time, and my sister already missed like 7 lessons, and most of the time i have to take my brother withy own car ( no gas money )
I'm pissed off that she keep berated everyone for spending money, but can't go a month without spending several grand on something useless.",nta
"title: WIBTA if i told my ride off for texting while driving?
content: My (17f ) family moved into a new neighborhood last night. I don't have busing to school from the new house. My classmate, who lives close to me, offered me a ride because her mom drives her to school every day. The mom is driving me out of complete kindness and it's a complete favor. She could have said no but she decided to do something nice for me and lend me a lift to school for the next couple of weeks. 

However i noticed that she sometimes goes on her phone while driving to text. This makes me extremely uncomfortable because I know how dangerous it is, but I don't want to be bossy or make it seem like I'm ungrateful. I'm in the car right now because today is my first ride with her. What if she does it tomorrow? WIBTA? what do i do?",nta
"title: WIBTAH if I go against my husband and respond to his father?
content: I (27f) and my husband (26m) are back once again. I made a post a while back about if I would be the AH if I tell my FIL that he cannot be around our son (9 months) until he works on himself. I mentioned in that post that FIL wasn’t coming around anymore, but might be back during christmas; which he was. That’s when I told him what I needed to say, and well it went as well as you can imagine. He began screaming at me, and that ended with me shutting the door in his face. He did not go without insulting me, which caused an anxiety attack. He stomped off as I was about to call the police, so I ended up calling my husband. 

I’ve had FIL blocked per my husband’s request since October 2022, so I haven’t heard anything from him or his wife since then; my husband though has received many texts from his father up until January. My husband texted his father telling him off basically, and then once again I was attacked. I was told that I am a liar, that none of the things FIL said to me was true, that I am insane and that I should be back in the Psych ward. I was extremely hurt by everything he said (there was more) and I told my husband that his father is not allowed near me or my family. My husband agreed, and told his father that if he comes around our house again that the police will be called. 

FIL hasn’t shown up again since, but now after five months he’s starting back up again saying that this has gone on for too long; that my husband and FIL really need to talk this out. My husband is ignoring the texts again, but history has proven that if we don’t reach out and make it clear that FIL will not come around he will try it again. We have a doorbell camera now as well so if FIL does show up at least we will know.

My husband is very against me unblocking his father and messaging him myself because he doesn’t want anything else to be stirred up, but at this point I think I should just remind FIL that he is not welcome around us. I’ll gladly accept the judgement of redditors, as well as speak to my therapist about it; so WIBTAH if I go against my husband and message his father?

ETA: I’m not going to reach out to FIL, and if he shows up the police will be called immediately. I’ll also add that I think in our state we need a large amount of evidence, like a disgusting amount to have a restraining order put in place. I will reach out to a lawyer and see if a cease and desist can be sent over to FIL, but I think that would start something all on its own. In our state he could have filed for grandparents rights, but hasn’t so I don’t think this is about our son anymore.",yta
"title: WIBTAH if we didn't return the sofa to my dad's cousin that his aunt gave him?
content: Hello all. I'll try and keep this as short as possible.

My dad (69m) recently traded a couple of living room chairs and a 3 seat sofa with his aunt for a big L sofa. Apparently he jokingly proposed the trade to her and she never gave that up and always asked him ""When are you picking up the sofa?"". He brought it home yesterday with his brother-in-law and I and we spent the better part of the afternoon setting it all up.

Anyway. Today he gets a call from his cousin (his aunt's daughter) telling him that that wasn't her mom's sofa, it was actually her's and she'd just stashed it away at her mom's place (The sofa had been there for a few years now). That it wasn't hers to give away. My dad got really angry about it but didn't respond right away to get his response in order.

I'm kinda conflicted about it. Like on the one hand, it is (allegedly) her sofa. But on the other, my dad traded his aunt for it. That and well, I helped carry the damn thing inside and down a couple of stories lol. To be completely fair to my dad's cousin, her mom is a bit off the rocker these days (but I don't think my dad traded in bad faith, he just thought that sofa was too big and unwieldly the way they set it up as her aunt didn't have enough space for it).

Anywho, would my dad be the asshole if he refused to return it?

EDIT: It's already decided that if we were to return the sofa, it's my dad's cousin burden to come pick it up. I saw a some people in the comments bickering about that point.

EDIT 2: My dad decided to return the couch to avoid a family conflict over a sofa. Cousin is apparently picking it up in a couple of weeks and storing it somewhere (hopefully not back to her mom's place, maybe we should charge her a storage fee? lol). Was kinda hoping she'd forget about it and leave it. It's kinda nice and comfy ngl. Also my dad does want to leave his things to hi aunt so that's kinda shit I guess. Anyway, where's that judge y'all keep talking about? I want my n64 games and my mario kart toys back goddamit!",nta
