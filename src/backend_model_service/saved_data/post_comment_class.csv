"title: (UPDATE) AITA for telling my step-daughter to “go ask her real dad” when she asked me to pay for her plane tickets?
content: [Original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/irxyza/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_to_go_ask_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Hey guys. It’s been a good 2 weeks since I’ve posted and I figured you guys would like an update. A lot has happened since the last time I posted

So that night, I did what many of the comments suggested I do, which was to apologize. I told her that I’m sorry that implying that I’m not her real father, but like it or not that I consider her MY daughter. That I loved her and will always be there for her. She started to cry and sob uncontrollably and said “Why doesn’t he [her biological father] love me?” I held her and told her she didn’t need to fight for his approval. I also apologized for looking through her phone; that I’ve come to accept that it’s not an appropriate punishment for a teenage girl, and I was going to find other alternatives. Lastly I brought up therapy and while she was hesitant at first I let her know it was nothing to be ashamed of, that everything she said at therapy would be entirely confidential, and that it could help to have a confidant to help her sort through her feelings. She sat on this for the day, but the next day let me know that she was ready so I set up the soonest appointment (which was last Friday and her second appointment this afternoon)

It’s only been a week so I don’t want to get too optimistic but honestly I feel like I’m noticing an improvement already. She’s actually been engaging back in small talk when normally she wouldn’t give me the time of day. She’s been following all of the rules, coming home at a reasonable hour, she’s been less withdrawn and more social even to the point where her brother commented on the change today! But the most exciting news of them all is when getting out the car on her way home from therapy, she said and I quote “thanks dad”. She’s never called me dad before so honestly I’ve been riding off that high for the last two hours 

I’m not delusional enough to think everything’s peachy but honestly the behavior change in the last week was the most progress we’ve had since, well, ever. I’m cautiously optimistic going forward. 

Thanks again everyone for your comments, especially the ones who gave me the kick in the ass I needed.",nta
"title: AITA - I missed my daughter’s award ceremony because of my son, she’s still not speaking to me
content: This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

I’ve been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He’s not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He’s been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it’s helped somewhat.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son’s main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. 

Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn’t leave, and he wasn’t calm for hours. I’d left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn’t going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I’d missed every game and performance she’d had as a child and it clearly wasn’t going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can’t help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I’ve barely spoken with her since. She didn’t send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn’t shown up for holidays and I’ve heard she’s engaged but didn’t call to tell me. She’s cut us out, and in the one of three times we’ve spoken since she said it’s easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn’t have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. 

AITA - I’ve offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn’t a perfect mom growing up - I didn’t make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I’m heartbroken but I don’t think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",yta
"title: AITA For Barring My Husband From The Bedroom Tonight?
content: So here is the situation.

Me: nurse. Working 50ish hours a week in paediatric ICU. Cry at least once a week because that shit is hard. My salary pays our bills. All of them. 

Husband: 25M. Has a degree but isn't looking for a job. Works 2 days a week at the grocery store. Spends most of his time playing LoL. 

Btw all events here are in accordance with Covid Legislation. 

Today was supposed to be A Good Day. I had been begging my husband to swap his Saturday shift to literally anything else so that we could have days off together. We haven't had a weekend together since our wedding, 18mo ago. 

Today was supposed to be our first Saturday off together. We were going to go to an animal sanctuary.


He starts the day by going to breakfast. With his best mate. Leaving before I even wake up. I wake up around 9 and realise he is not home. Call. He says he's helping his mate set up some lights and that the weather is too rainy for the animal sanctuary anyway. 

He gets home at 1ish. Lies around. Plays some video games, promising we would cook dinner together tonight.

Leaves again at 5 to help the same mate with something else. 

I go grocery shopping. I don't drive because of medical issues, but I walk there and back in the rain. I get home, realise I've left my keys inside. Call husband, knowing he's 5min away. He says he will leave in a minute. I sit in the rain and the cold (southern hemisphere). 45 min later, I call again. He hasn't left yet. He finally agrees to come and let me in the house, so he drives up, presses the clicker to let me in the garage and leaves again. 

At 10, I I called to see where he is. His friend answers. Says he is driving out to do something an hour away. 

It's 10.30. I am going to bed. I have sent him a txt that I am upset and don't want to speak to him tonight and would rather he left me alone. 

As far as I am concerned, if he can't value me more than his best mate on the first day off he and I have shared in a year and a half, he can go sleep in his bed instead. (Btw, his friend doesn't work, so they hang out all the time when I am at work). 

He is going to be upset. And he is gonna tell his mate and his mate is going to tell him I'm being a bitch. 

AITA

Adding some info: I am 26. We weren't always like this. I don't know what changed. I'm fairly confident he's not having an affair. And I fully intend on talking this through, but at a time that isn't 4am. 

Also the crying: sick babies sometimes make me sad, and I love all my patients. That's why I cry. And I don't mean hours of sobbing. I mean stepping into a supply closet to take a moment before getting back to work. 

Also thank you for your kindness. I was expecting maybe 5 replies. I am trying to respond as much as I can. But there are a lot of you.",nta
"title: AITA For Firing An Employee After His Parents Died?
content: I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

AITA?

\*\*Update\*\*\*

Holy fuck this blew up, I know this was shitty of me now. And I reached out to him to see how he's holding up. He's staying at his gf's place and she's supporting him a lot right now. I offered to get my head hunter friend in touch with him when he's ready and he accepted.",yta
"title: AITA For Refusing To Crochet Something For My Brother's Future Baby After Years Of Teasing?
content: Throwaway Account

I (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.

When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.

After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.

When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.

My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?

Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.

Edit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college.",nta
"title: AITA For Telling My Cousin That She's The Reason My Husband And I Have Re-Considered Adoption?
content: Throwaway Account   


I (33f) have had fertility issues for the past couple of years with my husband (35m). We went through with consultations and while we had very promising results for treatment the cost did give us pause. It wasn't that we couldn't afford it we just weren't at the point yet where we were willing to pay. I discussed it with my husband and we were both fine with the idea of adopting. 

My cousin Tiffany (25f) is adopted and she supported our choice in looking into it. However this was a couple of years back and during that time Tiffany was reunited with her birth parents and she's been acting pretty hurtful to my aunt and uncle since then. She keeps making post about how happy she is to know where she comes from and is happy about being reunited with her ""real family."" She even talked about having her birth father walk her down the aisle as a chance to make up for lost time. Obviously my uncle was very hurt about this but went he voiced it Tiffany got defensive. She called my uncle selfish, how this was about her and that he knew what he signed up for when raising someone else's kid.

Before the pandemic Tiffany moved closer to where her bio mother lived so they could make up for lost time, and Tiffany kept making post after post about all the fun she was having meeting relatives, and how she called/video chatted with each of her bio parents multiple times a week meanwhile she barely texted back my uncle and aunt once a month. I could tell how heartbroken my aunt and uncle were but tried to give Tiffany her space and the few times they said anything she accuse them of being selfish and unsupportive. I think the biggest thing that broke them was when Tiffany promised to come by for my aunt's birthday (COVID restrictions were lifted) and was even given the money to travel to them but then never showed up. She called literally the day before to say that her bio mom had an emergency so she wasn't going to make it, but didn't give back the money. 

I am completely disgusted by Tiffany's behavior and while I haven't completely ruled out adoption entirely I did want to give medical assisted conception a try. My husband supported this and we are now currently expecting. After we made our announcement Tiffany messaged me asking why I would spend thousands on creating a child when I could helped one who already existed. I tried to play it off but Tiffany kept pressing and calling me a bad person when there are so many children who desperately need a home and overpopulation. It got to the point where she was pissing me off and I just came clean and said that her behavior towards the people who loved and raised her was the reason. Tiffany got really upset but I didn't care, however, her parents are now starting to say that I was wrong so AITA?",nta
"title: AITA For calling my co-worker ""chunky"" after she repeatedly calls me ""slim"" and makes references to my weight after I asked her multiple times not to.
content: I have a female co-worker who repeatedly calls me out regarding my weight. I'm female 5'9"" 115lbs and very thin. She is very overweight. All the time she makes comments about my weight. She doesn't call me by name she calls me ""slim"" and I even heard her say one time ""go ask toothpick"" and she has said stuff like ""you need some meat on your bones"" & ""you need to eat"". I have only worked there 8 days. I have asked her very nicely to stop. Yesterday I asked her to stop calling me slim again and she basically said it's her mouth and she can say what she wants. 

Today when she said ""morning slim"" I replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. Everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying I'm wrong and I should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". I said as long as she calls me slim, I will call her chunky and now I'm the bad person. AITA if I don't apologize? The owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

EDIT FOR MORE INFO: We don't have HR. There's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). We are all regular employees. I went to the owner BEFORE I called her chunky and I asked him to talk to her because I felt she was harassing me. That's when he said we can handle it ourselves. That's why I called her chunky. I told her to stop calling me slim and I didn't like it and she continued to do it. She didn't stop doing it after I asked multiple times and I didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. She brought up my weight, I brought up her's.",nta
"title: AITA For keeping my promise of training her kids like dogs if/when my cousin dumps them on me?
content: I'm sorry if the title isn't accurate, I can't think of another description to describe the ""training"".

My cousin Amy (25F) has (6M) twins and has a nasty habit of dumping them onto relatives to babysit for the entire day without any warning or regard for their time. I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.

When she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.

The kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.

Soon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.

Two days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.

I shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.

Halfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?

She screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. 

I repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way. The other relatives she dumped them on (a majority) disagreed, but when I told a friend about the situation, he told me that the training I did can really fuck up the kids mentally later in life. 

So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA For kissing my friends brother without his consent during a truth or dare?
content: Yesterday I was supposed to spend the night at my friends house with some of my classmates and we were playing truth or dare. There really is no reason for us to choose truth since we already know a lot about each other so we mostly went just with dares. It was pretty fun and we had some weird challenges.

I was staying next to my friends brother and when it was my turn a classmate challenged me to kiss him. His sister immediately told my friend to change the dare and so she did. To be clear, her brother did not say anything when he heard the dare and just laughed so he definitely looked like he was ok with it right? Well WRONG because after I kissed him he told me wtf I am doing and looked like he was really grossed out by it. I was honestly a bit offended and asked him why he is so grossed by me kissing him, I am actually a pretty ok looking girl and even if I wasn’t, there was no reason for him to act like this. He ended up leaving the game and my friend told me that what I did was wrong on so many levels and to get out of her house. My other classmates didn’t say anything so I think they were on my side but didn’t want to participate in this argument (I will ask them when they go back home). Anyways I did end up leaving. Do you guys think I was the asshole here?

Please do NOT comment yet, read this:

Ok I don’t know how to explain this without being misunderstood but could you guys do me a small favor? I used a throwaway account for privacy reasons but the thing is, if this post blows up, there is a high chance for my friend to still see this. Could you please instead of commenting, DM me if your judgement is ‘YTA’? I promise if I get a lot of YTA dms I am going to ACCEPT the judgement as per rule 3 but it’s just weird if my friend sees this and sees ‘YTA’ comments especially after our last argument, you guys get what I mean right?

"title: AITA For my reaction when I got home and found my 6 months old daughter wearing the same diaper for 9 hours?
content: 
I 35-F been busy with work (I'm a nurse) and taking care of my 6 months old baby girl and her 6 years old sister. My husband work night shifts-3 nights a week so he's usually sleeping at home during the day. He got himself a ps5 a month ago. He started spending time playing. He used to handle some of the house chorus now all he does is make excuses of how tired he is and how much he needs sleep. But he'd come home from his shift and starts playing. He drinks a lot of coffee to stay concentrated and awake. Also he stopped eating properly. Keeps forgetting to do things I ask him to do. Like help fix his daughter's toys/take turns in changing diapers etc.

I started calling my mom to come help since he's been too busy to do simple things. He didn't like that I asked others for help and said I didn't have to. That he'll start helping again. I actually believed him and left for my 8 hour shift at the hospital and before I left I reminded him of everything he needed to do from feeding/changing diapers/cleaning our daughter's room etc. He said ""don't worry about it"" and then I left.

I called him to check on the kids and he said everything was fine. I came home in the evening and I was shocked to see our 6 months old's bed was put in the living room. Her stuff on the couch. While he was playing. She didn't stop crying he said he didn't know what was wrong. Turned out he didn't change the diaper after I left. She was wearing the same diaper for 9 hours. He said he forgot but he was busy playing. I immediately took care of her. I knew her rash was going to get worse after that. My 6 year old's hair was a mess he didn't brush her hair. The kitchen was a mess. I was livid kept yelling at him for being neglectful and reckless and literally forgetting about his own kids over a game.

He said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault for not reminding him on the phone. I told him it was my fault for leaving the kids with someone who doesn't even brush his teeth. He got offended and left the house minutes later.

His mom called me telling me that my husband stayes up at night to make a living for his kids and that I was pressuring him by giving him more than he could handle. I tried to explain but she kept lashing out calling me controlling and said I might be frustrated from my job that's why ""I'm taking it out on him"".

I hung up on her and had to take care of all of that mess.

"title: AITA For my reaction when my 30yo fiancè exchanged his gift with my 16yo brother?.
content: 
I F26 been with my fiancè for 3 years. We both work and we both share rent and other expenses. But My fiancè is currently looking for a new job. He lost his old job 3 months ago. My family lives 30min away and although it's been difficult this year I decided to get my brother (who has a chronic condition and struggled a lot lately and was in the hospital for a few days for anemia) the one thing he's been wanting for some time. I got him an Xbox that cost me 300$. He was so happy and I'm glad I was able to cheer him up during those times.

My fiancè received a few gifts from his family. But he wasn't happy with any of them. I got him a perfume and he liked it.

We were visiting my family and we had dinner with them. My fiancè looked at the Xbox I got for my brother and didn't stop talking about it. My parents noticed, I told him to stop complaining about what he got/didn't get this year. That made them uncomfortable especially since they've been dealing with my brother's health issues and needed to relax.

We got home and my fiancè took something from the closet and left for about an hour.

I was asleep when he came back. In the morning I was surprised to find my brother's Xbox in the closet. I woke him and asked him about it. Turned out He dropped me off drove back to my family's house and exchanged the gift his aunt gave him (a 14$ fancy pen) with my brother's xbox. He said that my brother was happy to exchange gifts. I was so mad I told him this wasn't for him and he basically took something that is not his. Not to mention a pen for an Xbox, that's ridiculous.
He told me that maybe I shouldn't have spent 300 while trying to pay for rent. I told him as long as I can pay rent that's not a problem. And that he needs to find a job if he thinks my money isn't enough. I called my mom and I found out that they didn't actually exchange gifts. My fiancè pressured my brother into giving him his Xbox. I was livid and so mad I told him to take the Xbox back to my brother but he said it was between him and my brother but I insisted. He refused so I ended up taking it myself. My fiancè argued when I took it and said that I was pressuring him and treating him poorly and have no respect for his feelings. I told him he was wrong to make my brother give him his gift and causing him stress and ruining his joy. I apologized to my brother and my parents and I felt awful because of how my fiancè behaved. My fiancè isn't talking to me saying that I have no consideration for his feelings and not understanding how he feels not having money to buy himself the things he likes.

I'm surprised because he has never done anything like this before. I get that he's struggling with finding a job but this is not an excuse.",nta
"title: AITA For not being happy that my sister is pregnant AGAIN?
content: Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main.

My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.

Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",nta
"title: AITA For not switching places with my friend and ruining her life
content: This happened a couple weeks ago but I'm still getting shit about it.

A friend of mine Daya (fake name) asked me if I wanted to come with her on some errands and see her new car. I said yes because I had some things to get done and my car was being checked over. (We're in the same bubble and stayed masked the whole time)

Well while we were out Daya ended up hitting another car while turning left. We were both shaken but mostly fine yet but when I started to call the police Daya started freaking out even more. She started begging me not to call the cops and to just go talk to the other driver. I didn't feel comfortable not calling them so I went ahead and did. Then Daya started begging me to get in the driver's seat, saying I had to get in the driver's seat, I had to claim I was the one driving. Turns out Daya doesn't have a license. She needed/wanted a car but didn't feel like getting her license so her mom bought the car for her.

I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police so I continued to refuse and just got out of the car and waited on the sidewalk for them to get there. Well Daya got arrested for driving without a license, insurance, or registration for her car and just told me today she has been found at fault for the accident.

Now Daya, her mom, and half of our friends are saying I'm an asshole for not just switching places. She is now facing multiple fines, possible jail time, and being kicked out of our MA program because of all this. I tried to explain that I didn't feel comfortable lying to the police but she just keeps calling me a ""privileged bitch"" and wishing horrible things would happen to me.

So am I the asshole for not switching places with her?

Edit: Several people have said I should include this and I'm sorry I didn't in the original post. This was much more serious than a fender bender. This was my response to someone else: ""She took the entire front of his car off or at least it looked like it. We were at an intersection and she was in a left turn lane with a yellow light and didn't look before she went. The other gentleman was coming the opposite way going straight. Both cars are totaled."" The gentleman was not unconscious as I originally thought but he did hit his head on the steering wheel and he had to be taken to the hospital. He did eventually get out of his car with help and that's when I believe I should have talked to him. Daya and I were mostly alright with just some bumps and bruises.

Edit 2: Someone suggested I add this because of people saying I am the asshole for calling the police but for major accident such as this one where I live you are required by law to call the police and file a report.",nta
"title: AITA For pressing charges when my stepson took something my daughter inherited from her mother?
content: I [M47] been with my wife for 2 years. She has a 21 year old son. I have a 14 year old daughter from my previous marriage. My late wife passed away in 2014. She left a few things for our daughter. Including a gold jewelry set. Her mom was devastated she didn't get to gift the set to our daughter on her wedding day. I keep it in my closet since it's expensive and my daughter is too young to have it. I'll hopefully gift it to her on her wedding.

Last week. We were sitting in the kitchen when my stepson was hesitant to ask me something. We're in good terms but have our fair share of arguments. He said his fiancèe was taking something from his mother's and my closet. saw the jewellery set and liked it very much. He asked if he could borrow it so his fiancèe can wear it at her cousin's wedding. I found this unacceptable I told him his fiancèe had no business being in the bedroom and that the jewellery isn't mine. It's for my daughter. He asked me if my daughter will agree to let him borrow it if he talked to her. I told him not to even talk about it again. He got all pissed and said things I do not remember.

Saturday night. When he and his fiancèe were at the wedding. I discovered that the jewellery set was gone. I told my wife and we looked all over the house. I called my stepson to tell him about calling the police because I really thought someone stole the set. He said there was no need. That he borrowed it and will return it after they get back from the wedding. I yelled at him and told him to come back with it right then. I kept calling him til 12am when he told me to stop calling and that he'd bring it in the morning.

I couldn't sleep that night I felt terrible. In the morning he showed up at 10am. He didn't bring it and started stalling saying: ""he forgot""- ""he'd bring it the next day"". At this point it was clear he gifted it to his fiancèe and was stalling. I got so mad I told him I will be pressing charges if he doesn't return the set today. We got into an argument
My wife said his fiancee was the one who wanted the jewelry set. But he was the one who took it and it's not even mine it's my daughter's which made it worse. Because I'm responsible for whatever happens to it.

His grandparents berated me after I told them this and got mad and defended him when I said that I will be pressing charges. he stole and needed to be responsible for his actions He didn't respond to my final calls so now I've given him one last chance and it's over

I pressed charges today. They're saying calling the police was extreme and cruel. They're all convincing me to back down.

Aita for pressing charges?

He was replying to me sarcastically when I said I'd get the authorities involved and he didn't take me seriously. His mom said she'd try to talk to him but I had enough of him stalling hoping I'll just let it go. So he can make his fiancèe happy.

I feel like an irresponsible idiot. I can't even look at my daughter without feeling frustrated and infuriated. I'm hurt but what's worse is that this is my daughter's property that I couldn't take care of.
My wife allows them into the room although I told her not to several times they're not kids and there should be some boundaries.

I just needed to mention that We're in Europe.",nta
"title: AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?
content: This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

This post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person I believe wronged me.",nta
"title: AITA For refusing to listen to my parents and wanting to sue my cousin for a ""prank""?
content: 
I 31M) recently had my cousin M21) move in with me after he got kicked out of his college dorm and had no job to pay for rent. My parents told me I needed to step up and help because I own a house, live alone with my two golden retrievers and two birds that I had since last year. My cousin would make fun of me whenever I call my pets ""family"" and thinks I'm crazy. He has a bad sense of humor and thinks he's funny. He calls me funny nicknames like robot/terminator/optimus prime and others because I wear a prosthetic leg that I've gotten after I had an infection *2 years ago.

I been patiant with him causing a mess and not even doing his own laundry it's been 3 months and it's too much already. So Recently he started doing pranks and using personal things in his pranks. Like clothes/my phone/stuff from the kitchen etc. I usually take off my prosthesis before going to bed and since I work all day I got to bed early unlike him he stays up til 3-4am. He decided to do a prank and hid my prosthesis somewhere.

I saw that it was gone in the morning (*he did it twice before and hid it in his room and the garage) I had enough of his bullshit I asked him where he took it and he joked and said that it was inside the fridge I was livid. I started screaming at him to stop it and to tell me where my prosthesis was before I kick him out. 

He realized I was being serious and told me that it was in the attic I let him go get it and when he brought it to me he looked worried and started apologizing when I saw the socket had cracks, the adjustment pyramid and pylon were damaged. He told me he hid it under the old tv and didn't think it was this fragile. It was there overnight so the damage has already been done. I lost my shit I yelled at him while all he did was apologize saying it was just a prank ""bro"" which made it worse I told him to leave and called my aunt to tell her about what her son did and that she needed to pay for the damages. her reaction was shocking. she said that it was my fault because I knew how her son is and decided to take him in anyway and that she won't take responsibility for his actions. I told her I'd seriously sue because I'm broke and have no money to pay for a prosthesis and crutches are unbearable. I was so angry. I kept lashing out at everyone. Especially my mom and dad who argued with me and said that I can't sue ""family"" and this is my cousin and he meant no harm. I told them that he created this situation and needed to fix it. They called me awful for refusing to wait til Christmas is over and family gathering is over then they'll figure something out. I told them to stay out of it but until now they're telling me to not cause an issue we're in the holidays and suing my cousin will make them look bad to everyone. I'm stuck here with crutches feeling awful after they all tried to shut me up and told me to wait til holidays are over then they'll ""raise"" money for me and my cousin gets away with it.

EDIT: My dad offered to fix it himself but this is ridiculous he thinks that this is some object like a CD player or a tv he can fix. I called him ridiculous to his face And I didn't let him touch it. He clearly thinks it's no big deal. I stopped taking his calls after that because he doesn't realize how big of an issue this is.",nta
"title: AITA For telling my fianceé she's either with me or against me in this conflict?
content: So My fianceè (F, 24) & I (M, 27) got engaged in may and are currently planning for our wedeing in Aug. It's worth mentioning that I'm the sole earner  because my fianceé is still in University, I've saved up decent amount of money to afford the wedding.


Thing is her parents get involved in everything. From picking the engagement ring on my behalf, to giving opinions on where we should rent and now my FMIL is constantly giving opinions on our wedding. FMIL would follow up on everything we do and make negative comments on things like: the best man, the guest list, and food.
She told my fianceè she didn't like who I picked to be my best man and wanted me replace him after a big argument but I said no. Though My fianceè said we shouldve just done it.
MIL also wanted me to un-invite people I wanted at the wedding so she could add more guests on her side of family. I said no to that also.

Now the current or biggest conflict between us. MIL called saying she didn't like the venue we picked which is in our hometown. She wanted me to reconsider but I said no since my fianceé liked it too.
But my fianceé came to me yesterday to show me a venue her mom picked and already paid for saying since she paid for it then I should say yes this time. I was in shock and angry because not only did she not consult us but the venue she picked is 3 towns away where my BIL lives. I immediately thought about my disabled parents who can not travel this distance for health reasons, besides that most of my family won't attend because of distance. I said absolutely not agreeing on this venue. My fianceé said she disagreed with me and I had no right to complain because her mom AND dad paid a lot of money for this venue as wedding gift and we should accept it. I calmly explained why I refused and she kept saying I'm refusing on purpose because ""I hate her mom"" and am playing cat & mouse with her. I bluntly said her mom is indeed making this a game and told my fianceé she's either with me or against on this issue. She either backs me up or there won't be anymore wedding planning. She got upset and started crying asking what she's going to tell her mom and why I was making her choose between me & her parents but I just feel like she's refusing to see why I don't want this specific venue. So what of her brother lives there. I have never been to that town so having the wedding just cause her mom paid for the venue is not ok.


We haven't talked eversince that argument. My friend called me ungrateful fool for turning away a free wedding venue over distance but I can't help but feel FMIL did it purposely.",nta
"title: AITA For telling my wife her parents are not allowed to ever watch our son again
content: My wife and I have a 2-year old son and have been married for 4 years.  Our anniversary was a month ago and we found a nice, secluded cabin on AirBnB and rented it out for a long weekend getaway.  My wife asked her parents if they would be willing to watch our son and they agreed as long as we dropped him off at their house.  That worked for us since it was on our way anyway.

I was raised lutheran and my wife was raised catholic, but neither of us currently go to church and have not had our son baptized.  My MIL knows this and hates it. She thinks our son needs to be baptized or he will burn in hell, she's that kind of catholic.  

So we go on our trip and when we pick up our son and ask how the weekend went, MIL says everything went fine and that she has saved my son's soul from the devil. I ask her what she meant and she says she had our son baptized that morning at her church. I tried my best to keep my cool so I didn't scream at MIL in front of my son, but I pretty much grabbed my son and left. On the car ride home I was fuming and told my wife as calmly as I could that this would be the last time her parents have our son unsupervised. She tried to downplay what her mom had done but I told her we need to wait until we get home to talk about it because I'm not fighting in front of my kid.

When we got home and had a chance to talk about it, things got heated. I told my wife I no longer trust her parents with our son and that if they did something like this behind our backs I can't trust them to respect our wishes as parents in the future. I said this was a huge breach of trust and I will forever look t her mom differently. She continued to try to defend her mom saying that she was only doing what she thought was best for her grandson. She even downplayed it by saying that it's just a little water and a few words and we don't go to church anyway so what does it matter.

I told her that under no circumstances will I allow her parents to watch our son by themselves again. I said that we can still let them see their grandson, but only if we are present. I also said that if she doesn't see what the big deal is with this situation, that maybe we aren't on the same page as parents and maybe we need to see a counselor. She started crying and said that this isn't the kind of decision I get to make on my own and I'm an asshole for trying to tell her what kind of relationship her parents can have with our son.

I told her that I no longer have any trust or respect for her parents and that I don't know if there's anything they can do to repair that. I told her I don't care if that makes me an asshole, but what her parents did was unforgiveable in my eyes and they put themselves in this position to lose privileges with our son. She's been trying to convince me to change my mind for the last month, but I'm not budging. To me this is a hill I'm willing to die on.",nta
"title: AITA For telling my wife that if she wants to bedshare she needs to sleep in the kids beds?
content: My wife and I have been together for six years, she has a thirteen year old and a nine year old. When we first got together they were both still in her bed, they were both relatively small and I worked nights. It was never an issue. Last year I suffered a work injury and now have to sleep on a memory foam mattress. 

I assumed by now both kids would of grown out of cosleeping, but obviously havent. I cant comfortably sleep in a bed with two kids, especially because my stepson (nine) is a little ninja. He is constantly kicking during the night.

They will occasionally sleep in their own beds, but very rarely. My stepdaughter is a little better, but stepson will have meltdowns if we try and send him to his own bed. 

My wife doesnt believe we should force them out, which I understand, but I cant keep sleeping on the couch when they're in the bed. 

A couple days ago I blew up over it. My backs killing, I'm tired. 

I essentially told her to take the kids and sleep in one of their beds, I need the comfortable mattress for my back. We never really got to discuss it because stepson got upset and started crying. That night she took the kids to her parents for the night, and back at home she explained that they wouldnt all fit in one of the kids beds. 

She agreed that I could have the big bed, but is ordering a memory foam mattress for our sons bed so I can sleep there comfortably. I dont want to sleep in a kids bed; I want my bed, and I'd like to actually spend a night with my wife. 

Her parents are on her and the kids side, obviously, but I still dont think I should have to give my bed up for them, in the nicest way possible. I paid for it. 

The issue is getting worse, and my in laws are now calling me abusive for trying to take their comforts. 

So, am I the asshole?

"title: AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before
content: I feel like I need to say this for this post not to be removed, this is not about the date, about relationships or something I want a judgement on me walking out of there.

Cast: Me (25M), Joe(26M), Jane(24F)

To give you a little background to this situation, I met Jane through Joe's girlfriend at her birthday party last year. At first Jane was fun to talk to but not even an hour later Jane was really in to me and tried really badly to hit on me during the party, which pretty much ruined my time there as the feeling was not mutual in the slightest bit also at the time I was already with someone. So the first impression I got from Jane was that she was clingy, annoying and just wouldn't stop bothering me.

Unfortunately for me she became part of my larger friend group because she is part of Joe's girlfriends friend group(That is a mouthful sheesh) and because me and Joe hang out a lot and I am also friends with his girlfriend, I pretty much run in to her at minimum twice a month.

So first time Jane asked me out was a month after that party, I informed her I was with someone and not interested, she tried again a 2 months later when I broke up with my then girlfriend, again I declined her advances and told her I was not interested. I got in to a new relationship not long after but unfortunately she and I broke up about 2 months ago. Since then as you might have anticipated, Jane has asked me out again, I said no again.

Well that brings us to this week, everything has been opening up here and Joe had been trying to fix me up with a friend of his girlfriend and would not tell me who(He is well aware of me having rejected Jane multiple times and the fact I am not interested in her, he knows this in detail.) After a lot of what he calls convincing and I call whining(I had no interest in dating anytime soon) I relented and decided to agree to this double date idea of his.

We agree on meeting at Joe's apartment and lo and behold Joe, His girlfriend and Jane are occupying  the dinner table obviously intending for my date to be Jane, I honestly just got so goddamn angry I that I couldn't even get a single word out, turned around and left.

I have been bombarded with texts and calls about how much of a douche I am and how terribly I hurt Jane and so on and I am just like, I literally rejected her like three times, I am not interested in her, you knew that, your girlfriend knew that, our entire friend group has a running joke about obsessive Jane FFS so literally everyone knows it. So am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA For wanting to keep my bees even though my new neighbor's son is highly allergic to them?
content: I have been keeping bees as a hobby for six years now. I have 4 hives in my suburbian backyard along with a large garden.

My hives are all properly registered and are legal to keep in my town as of right now. 

The problem is that my new neighbors have asked me to get rid of my bees. They purchased the house and moved in over the winter and hadn't noticed my girls until this spring. 

Apparently their son is highly allergic to bee stings. He has been hospitalized more than once and has to carry an epi pen. 

They asked nicely but seemed a little upset when I said I don't think I could do that. They didn't push the issue with me further but I saw a rant on nextdoor that I am sure was written by them.

Some time after that some of the bee hating nextdoor people when to our town board and tried to get bee keeping outlawed in our town. Luckily it didn't pass and they had mentioned in the minutes that current bee keepers would have to be grandfathered in if it did (Because of that I am even more wary of giving it up in case they do bring this legislation up again If I have active hives I can keep them)

My neighbors and I aren't really on speaking terms now. 

AITA For wanting to keep doing my hobby?

EDIT: Thank you for your input everyone

Since many have suggested this - I DO already have security cameras in place. All around my house and pointing directly at the hives. You cannot access the hives without spending significant amount of time on video. The hives are also behind locked fences. 

I just purchased a sign to put on their* gate that says this area is under video surveillance and will be affixing that to their gate ASAP.

*by their I mean the bee's gate!

EDIT 2: 

Sorry to see we couldn't play nice and this thread got locked. Also thanks for the death threats in my DMs LOL

But it looks like the overall consensus is NTA. So thanks for helping to put my mind at rest about this.

Well, After sleeping on it and spending the morning making a few legal calls...

**THE BEES ARE STAYING.**

I just can't take the financial blow on this one. I have spent thousands on my yard. It provides a nice side income and I just can't do it. 

I have all my legal ducks in a row, with my set up, carrying the proper insurance, and following all the state and local laws. I shouldn't have much to worry about legal issues as long as I keep doing it the way I have been. 

I will reach out to my neighbors with an olive branch and some suggestions to keep their kid safe. 

Many people have asked how I would feel if something happened to the kid. And sure, I would feel bad about it. It would be tragic.

Also me bees have *always* been legally permitted and registered.",nta
"title: AITA I lied about having a college fund for my step sister to save my sister
content: I am 32F. I grew up with a narcissistic mom. I have never met my dad. The first hug I have received in my life was at 10 years old when Dan (my mom's BF) hugged me when I thanked him for a gift. My mom had my sister a year later. My sister was the perfect baby sister anyone could ask for. Mom and Dan split and at first mom had major custody of my sister. Mom did the same thing to my sister she did to me, doesn't even acknowledge us in the room if she was not in the mood, not feeding us dinner if we made a mistake, made everything our fault. When Dan found out, he applied for full custody for my sister but my mother fought and somehow wrangled 50% of custody.

&#x200B;

Things got real bad for me and the only silver lining was my sister. Despite being only 4 years old, she would sneak in snacks from her dad for me to eat. Anything Dan bought for her, he also bought me. He wasn't wealthy by any means but it was the small things and anytime he dropped my sister, he will take his time to talk to me. He was the only father I have ever known. Dan died of cancer when I was 16 and my sister 5. He lived only 3 months from the diagnosis but settled everything financially as able as he can for my sister. He split his assets 75% for my sister and 25% for me to be given to me when I reached 18. Knowing my mom very well, he made me the executor of my sister's fund too. To say my mom was furious was an understatement. She literally made the next 2 years of my life and my sister a living hell.

&#x200B;

When my mom started dating Brad, he already had a daughter 3 years younger than my sister. My mom had made it absolutely clear that my sister will be allowed to go to college only if she shares her trust fund with our stepsister. Brad is a piece of work and me and my sister never really bonded with our stepsister. She refused to sign anything related to my sister's education unless I give her my word that I will give my step sister equal half of the trust fund. This is where I think I was the asshole. I held the trust fund above my mom's head to treat my sister fairly. I repeatedly told them I will give my step sister half the fund until my sister was 18 and moved to college.  Once she moved out, we both cut any contact we had with our mom and blocked her. I made my sister give her the wrong college info, so our mom couldn't contact her.

&#x200B;

I have found out through few friends my mom didn't know I have that my step sister couldn't get into any college because she didn't want to apply any loans and she is very depressed. I know I misled them, but I honestly wanted my sister to be safe.

&#x200B;

AITA for causing my step sister's depression and robbing her of college

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for your reassurance. I showed this post to my sister and the only thing she had to say was ""Duh"". We both have discussed and decided to not contact our step sister. We were never close to her and my friends back there can't safely get any message to her without dragging our mom into it which is the last thing we both want.

All these awards, thank you all again and the kind stranger who gave me gold.",nta
"title: AITA flipping out on my fiance for cancelling all the vegan food options from our wedding food menu behind my back?
content: 

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads & appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

"title: AITA for ""announcing"" that my dad's not paying my college tuition
content: My aunt and uncle are paying for my cousins college.  

My dad had a college fund for me, but he had stipulations like he wanted nothing below a B for grades and to pre approve any classes I take, weekly meetings to discuss grades and a bunch of other stuff. Which would be fine if you have a normal dad. Mine isn't.  

My dad has a temper and I spent 6th-12th grade stressed out about grades and being screamed at or grounded over things that sometimes weren't even my fault like a teacher not updating online grading and an assignment being marked ""missing"" because of it.  And getting my back pack and locker randomly searched by him for no reason besides ""to make sure I'm not hiding anything "". 

I decided to pay for school myself because of 1 not being stressed over getting screamed at 2 I didn't feel like constantly worrying that he'd disapprove  of a class or a grade and decide not to pay. Which I could totally see him doing.  I'd rather be in debt than controlled for 4 more years.  

I just finished my first year. 

Well my family got together on the 4th and... well sometimes they're nosey.   They were talking about my cousins school and my uncle looked at my dad and said ""well how much is - my name- school costing you?"" 

I said ""what are you asking him for I'm the one paying for it?"" 

Later on my dad was pissed off and said that it was out of line to say that and I embarrassed him. 


I didn't do it to embarrass him, I was just being honest.  He doesn't even know how much tuition is so he was the wrong person to ask.

"title: AITA for ""forcing"" my father to pay child support
content: My father is a dick. When he got my mother pregnant he wanted her to quit her job and just stay home to ""be a good little wife and mother.  He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  

So the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). 
His family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. 

When they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.

So long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  

He is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  

He has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  

I don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  

But I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. 

I'm not giving it back. 

AITA?

Edit: to answer some common questions. 

1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. 

2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. 

3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. 

4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.

5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.

Edit número dos.

I just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her ""friend"" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.

Edit tres

My half brother has posted about this. He has a slightly different viewpoint than myself.  He is not in any way coming after myself or my mother. If you comment there keep in mind he is a young man who is disillusioned with his father.",nta
"title: AITA for ""hacking"" my moms instagram to see if she violated NDA?
content: I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.

Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.

My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""

My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""

Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.

My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.

I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.

It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is. So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for ""imposing my culture"" even though I thought I was just being nice?
content: \*\*\*\*\* UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tc16mg/update\_aita\_for\_imposing\_my\_culture\_even\_though\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tc16mg/update_aita_for_imposing_my_culture_even_though_i/) \*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though I (23f) am American, my parents are immigrants and therefore I have a different cultural upbringing than most. One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.

My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.

I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were ""a charity case"". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.

After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?

quick edit: I didn't realize you could edit posts directly but I'm in a hurry to convince him to let me go over to his parent's house. I did post a brief update and faq in my most recent comment.",nta
"title: AITA for ""making fun"" of a woman for being in her 40s and single?
content: This whole saga started because my husband took my last name. A couple weeks ago he got his workplace to change it, and his coworkers found out. About half of them think this is the funniest thing ever and about half are deeply offended. Brenda is in the offended half, and has made that clear. 

He and I are in a group chat with his coworkers where we organize carpooling during the pandemic. It is very helpful to us, so we can't leave the chat. Since he changed his name, my husband and I have been dealing with a lot of dumb jokes in the chat, which we have been mostly ignoring. 

Yesterday Brenda, his coworker and I got into a bit of a spat. I messaged the group asking if someone could take my husband home since I wouldn't be back from work until late and needed the car. One of his other coworkers agreed, and I thought that was that. 

Brenda messages the group saying ""maybe if you spent less time at work and more time being a wife, your husband wouldn't come into work with dirty shirts"" I took this as a bad joke initially. My husband is a rural mail carrier, so his shirts look like shirts worn by someone in 90 degree heat on dusty roads. I do wash them, but there's only so much to be done. 

Me: I could make cleaning those shirts my full-time job and it wouldn't do much lol

Brenda: you won't be married very long if you keep trying to be the man in the relationship. I'd be embarrassed as a wife if I did so little for my husband

Me: well I work more hours and pay the bills, so I think he can oxyclean his own shirts if it's so important

Brenda: maybe you should learn to take proper care of your husband or you'll find yourself divorced. 

Me: I'll let you know when I need relationship advice from someone who is 42 and single

Now apparently Brenda is going around and saying that I ""mocked her for being single in her 40s"". I don't care if someone is single in their 40s, but I think it's absolute bullshit that she can call me a bad wife but I can't point out she has no frame of reference. 

AITA reddit?

Edit: people keep asking why I need to help arrange rides in the first place. When my husband is out on deliveries he rarely has cell service, so if I find out late that I'm going to be home late I need to be able to reach his coworkers directly. Multiple spouses are in the chat for the same reasons.

Edit 2: people are saying that I've hurt my husband's feelings by saying I pay the bills. After reading the exchange he sent me a text saying ""sometimes I forget you're a hard little bitch who takes no prisoners. I'm so proud lol."" 

He's fine, I asked him just now if my comment about the bills hurt him and he said ""oh yeah, it's so hard having a hot wife who makes good money. Really tough, pray for me.""",nta
"title: AITA for 'going off' on a mother in the toy store
content: I'm (28M) my brothers care taker (21M mental age 7-8), our parents decided at 18 to tell us to screw off, so when my brother (let's call him Bill) turned 18 I grabbed him and enrolled him to get his GED since he didn't finish highschool, and take care of him. His chores are too clean his room,  help with laundry and set the table for supper. I get paid by the state and you better believe I make sure his needs are met. He's my little bud. 

At the end of the month for each day he does his chores he gets a sticker, at the end of the month that sticker gets counted as 5$ and he uses the money for whatever he wants.  Like toys, special snacks etc. He loves this. 

He's been so good lately with chores I took him out for burgers and fries and took him to the toy store. My brother is big.  Not fat, just tall and actually big boned (he's healthy weight and overall health), he gets excited and stims by flapping his hands, you do you little dude. 

At the toystore he announced he wants Barbie's,  cool,  no judgement,  and we go look at barbies. He's stimming and rambling about what he wanted and meanwhile a lady and little girl come in the aisle. Not even two minutes pass and the lady tells us to go to another aisle, she wants to look at the dolls and his weird hand movements are freaking her out.  I tell her to wait her turn. 

Not even another minute passes and she tells my brother to knock it off and go look at something else. Now I'm pissed. I tell my brother to get what he wants and looked at her and told her, her daughter could use a better role model, I'd hate for her to turn into such a grouchy hag. Took my brother out to pay for his barbies all while ignoring her telling me how much of an asshole I am for saying that in front of her daughter.

"title: AITA for DEMANDING my SIL replace the expensive fabric she and her children DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?
content: I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like I'm being a cunt. I'll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight for my hobbies.

We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.

On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.

I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This was a GIFT to myself.

I fucking screamed ""What the hell are you doing?!"" and ran to the table. She looked alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she'd done. Her fucking kids spilled all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts, and get OUT.

After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that ""ugly ass"" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn't look like anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.

Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale for $3.99 this weekend.

I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here's 6 yards of ugly ass fabric. I deadpanned ""Get the fuck out of my house. Now."" and she got very angry and started arguing with me that it's not her fault that I have expensive taste. I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.

Of course I'm being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn't ""graciously"" accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don't know fabric, this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020 Maserati.

AITA?

**EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an ""honest mistake"" by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.

**SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed her. Each shelf is labeled with what they're for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest bed, etc. I said ""You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There's one with paint on it. You can use that."" The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber content.

**THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style, use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren't part of the issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own eventually as well. <3",nta
"title: AITA for abandoning a grieving friend after she tried to charge me rent?
content: My friend is a recent widow. It's been a long time coming but that hardly makes it easier, her husband passed away at the end of February and she has been understandably distraught since. I have tried my best to support her through this even though I can't possibly understand what she's going through. At the beginning of the March she asked me if I'd stay over during the night because she couldn't stand sleeping alone in an empty house. I obliged and temporarily moved in once I was sure my husband was okay with it. She's not been taking care of herself so I have been doing 100% of the household chores and taking care of her and all her responsibilities as well as working full time. Well last week she spring on me how much she'll be expecting in rent from here on out. She heavily implied I was taking advantage of her in her grief trying to live in her house for free and that she expects me to backpay her rent for the two months I'd already been there. I was extremely insulted by this and told her I'd transfer her the money she wanted but I would be moving back to my own house (where I am also paying rent). I got my stuff and was out within a couple of hours.

"title: AITA for acting like a conspiracy theorist to get out of political arguments with my Dad?
content: My Dad loves to have political arguments/“discussions” with me and other members of the family. I honestly think he does not care about half these issues and just wants to have fights with me and other people in the family. I have tried to simply opt out of them, but my Dad will get upset at me for “not participating with the family dynamic” and “never talking to him.” I also don’t really want him to have these discussions with other members of my family, since they almost always end up in hurt feelings. I’ve been looking for a redirect for a while. 

I read a post online on doubling down whenever someone says a conspiracy theory, for example if someone says “they faked the moon landing” you say “haha, you sucker, you believe the moon is real?” I decided to implement the strategy after getting into way too many political arguments and upsetting myself and everyone around me.

My Dad saw something about climate change and started talking about how the Chinese government partnered with Obama to make it all up. I truly did not want to get into this political discussion. Instead I said, “oh, you’ve heard that, well get this” and discussed my new theory about how the federal government has created a tornado machine to set on people who want to vote Republican in the next election. He was truly flabbergasted at how stupid this was and decided to stop talking to me about this. It was wonderful. I’ve been doing it even more, and I haven’t had a political argument in a whole month. 

This Christmas, he had a doozy planned. My aunt and her wife are feminist and very pro-choice. At the dinner table, he tried to do a toast to the “death of Planned Parenthood.” Let me note that he is pro-choice, really doesn’t care about this issue, and has said so several times. I think he just wanted to start a fight for the sport of it. Time and place! I said, “oh, thank God you mentioned it, I have to tell you this news I learned” and I talked about how Planned Parenthood does not in fact perform abortions, since it’s physically impossible, but instead removes entire uteruses and replaces them with dog uteruses. 

I received a lecture about “not taking people’s political views seriously” from my Mom. I said it was just a strategy I use to diffuse political discussions. My Mom said, “you’re just making yourself look dismissive at best and insane at worst.”",nta
"title: AITA for admitting I regret having children.
content: My wife and I are both 42 and in marriage counselling after our marriage basically went to shit after having kids (6 and 4 year old twins). A lot of issues and disagreements have come up in our marriage that have driven us apart and I have been working through my resentment that going back for one more baby resulted in twins, including one which we are pretty sure has ADHD and ODD and is a *nightmare* child). 

Our counsellor asked me if I would have children if I had to do it all over again and I said ""honestly, no"". 

I love my kids and would take a bullet for them, but if I had the chance to go back to 24 when I finished grad school and could do my life over again, I wouldn't choose fatherhood. It is not the fulfilling experience everyone claims and while I love my children, the sacrifices are not worth it to me. I had a much happier life before having children and have gone from someone who loved life to someone who just.....makes it through the day, working a job he hates to provide for the wife and kids while silently wishing this wasn't my life. 

My wife is *furious* and taking it the wrong way and even told our 6 year old ""daddy wishes you were never born"" which makes me livid. You don't tell the kid that.

Yes, I wish I never had kids, but I do love them, would never hurt them or want to upset them. And I didn't say it to/in front of my kids and I never ever will. I said it in marriage counselling, what should be a safe space to talk about feelings. 

It has become a huge fight, our marriage is not going to be saved now, and I know she will try and use this against my in divorce court to try and get sole custody and take everything and lie to the kids who I do love and still want to be a Dad to them. She is incapable of understanding that you can love your kids but also feel that parenthood was the best choice for you. 
 
AITA for saying it though?

Edit: Ok this blew the fuck up and there is no way I can reply to everyone's questions. But to address a couple I have 3 kids not 4. One child is 6, two are four. English is not my first language and I forgot the comma, and even so that sentence would have been much clearer in my native language. 

When I say I resent having twins, I am not saying it is my wife's fault! But 3 children is more than we budgeted/bargained for and I need to pick up a lot overtime I that I would not have had to pick up if we just had 2 kids, and that is what I resent (that and the child with ADHD/ODD). My life is basically work and dealing with my kids. And do you know what ODD is? This child always refuses to do what is asked, gets angry and throws a tantrum when asked to do something he doesn't want to do, hits and kicks others, deliberately annoys and hurts others, is extremely spiteful, screams and kicks me constantly. ALWAYS. All day. Every day. It's exhausting and it is hell. 

Yeah. I would't have him again. Most people wouldn't if they had to raise him.  

Just because I wouldn't do this over again doesn't mean I'm not committed to being a good dad and being present in their lives. I just would not do it over again if I could redo my adult life. 

My first kid was not born at 24, I just said that because if I could do my whole post-University life differently, I would change some other things too (mainly career) and to be honest, after all this, I regret marrying my wife, which is why I said it that way.

Regarding calling the ADHD/ODD twin a nightmare, go google what that means. It is very difficult to manage and he has even been kicked out of three daycare places because they could not handle him and my parents even refuse to babysit him. We never get a break from home and no one can handle time.",nta
"title: AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?
content: I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",esh
"title: AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""
content: I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


I got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for asking if my cousin made her first million yet?
content: Hello friends, I'm from the future. Throwaway, yada yada.

Well, technically we're a few hours away from 2021. So advanced happy new year.

I'm currently outside on our terrace while my family is gathered in the livingroom after having asked me to step outside for a bit, because apparently I've ruined the mood. I'm turning to you guys to ask if I'm the asshole for what I just did.

Family from all over the city has gathered to celebrate the new years. Covid is thankfully low in my city and we've taken the necessary precautions.

As is typical of Asian family reunions, the old people in the family love to 'check up' on their nieces and nephews. One of my aunt's A, loves to show off her kids' achievements, particularly her daughter Pat. 

While listing off her daughter's achievements (passing the bar, recently getting married to a fellow lawyer), my aunt turned to me and asked what I've achieved in 2020. 

She began to list off all my lack of achievements, like how I'm thirty and still unmarred (I'm a dude, if that matters), about how I'm still living at home with my parents and how I'm still driving my shitty 2000-something civic. My other cousins joined in on the jeering and listed all the other failed aspects of my life. 

Now, I graduated with a degree in architecture, but after multiple attempts just can't seem to pass the exam. This has been a point of contention in the family because my other cousins are lawyers, teachers, etc, whatever. These days I basically work freelance from home. 

I don't know why, but my aunt's condescending voice got to me and I said ""I made my first million this year. Has Pat made her first million yet?"" Then turning to my cousins I asked the same, ""You guys made your first million yet? Because I have."" 

The room fell silent. I basically killed the mood. My dad asked me to go outside and relax because apparently I might have just ruined everyone's new year celebration.

Was I an asshole?

P.S. First million in our local currency not USD.",nta
"title: AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?
content: **EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she’s started seeing. I’m 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone’s favourite uncle. And while i’m glad everyone else is comfortable, i’m not. 

He isn’t a bad guy, I’m just still grieving my father, and it feels like he’s trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn’t because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it’s only fair because i have siblings now. I think it’s ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He’s trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren’t lacking for anything but he thinks it’s only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there’s a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it’s pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren’t until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and “possible loss of car privileges.”

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i’m leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i’m glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won’t be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won’t want to have a relationship with him. 

He told my family and they think i’m the asshole. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for asking my parents for their entire estate if they want me to be my sister's guardian.
content: I (F23) have been told my entire life that if anything happens to my parents I will be my sister's guardian. She is 33 and has some disabilities. She is currently living in a group home. The government pays for a good portion of the cost but not all.  My parents have made sure that they have accessed every resource available for her to make sure she has as good a life as she can. 

I was we were visiting her this last weekend when they brought it up again.  They are both reasonably healthy but they both had health scares in the last couple of years.  They once again said that I would be her guardian.  

I have been giving this a fair bit of thought. I have two older brothers. They are both married and established in their careers. They would be better choices than I am.  

I want to go see the world. I am lucky enough that my job can be done from anywhere that I can access the internet.  

When we went sort dinner I brought it up and said that I had three ideas.  

1. They make all three of us her guardians so we could split the responsibilities and duties. 

2. They leave their entire estate to my sister in a trust that will oversee her care. 

3. They leave me their entire estate with the proviso that I become her sole guardian and take full responsibility. Minus sentimental stuff for the rest of my family obviously. 

I thought that was fair since it's not like they are rich and their estate will mostly consist of their house and the insurance policies they took out when they realized the long term costs of care for my sister.  

They said that I'm trying to shirk my responsibility to my sister and that I'm greedy for trying to get everything.  

I had one last suggestion and they really hated it.  I said that they were welcome to cut me completely out of their will.  But that had to include guardianship of my sister.  They could leave everything to her and my brothers but that meant I would be completely free of responsibility for her care.  

My dad got really angry and my mom was crying when I left.  

My brothers both called me to say I was being an asshole springing this on my parents. And that I was being greedy trying to keep them and their families from getting anything when our parents pass away.  I asked both if them if they wanted 100% responsibility for our sister in return for the entire estate. I volunteered to sign away everything to them.  Neither one took me up on the offer.",nta
"title: AITA for asking my son and daughter inlaw for a copy of the key to the new house they bought?
content: 

2 weeks ago my son [Ethan, 27]and his wife [Jess, 30] bought a small one story house in the town we live in. After settling down they invited us for a small party for the occasion.

We sat for dinner and talked about the house a bit. Me, my husband and Jess continued conversing after Ethan excused himself to take an important call. Jess showed me the original key to the house and I asked if she made copies yet and she said no. I said she should and also give one copy to me as well. She looked at me funny and asked why she should. I explained that it is necessary so that it could be used in emergencies. she rudely said ""I don't know what kind of an emergency that would require you having a key to our house, sure won't be a fire incident!"". She obviously didn't seem to have any idea that a fire incident wasn't what I meant and I got offended by her sarcasm. I pointed out that it's not just her decision because this is my son's house as well. She smiled at me trying to be polite and stated that only the ones who contributed towards the house get a copy and that I really don't need one anyway. Also assured me that my son will have the same answer for me. Basically saying ""Don't bother bring this up with Ethan, he'll tell you the same thing"" but I did and she spoke on his behalf the entire argument repeating what she said over and over. Things escalated to her calling me pushy and me telling her she was being unnecessarily rude and disrespectful .

My husband and I left in a rush and I felt horrible. My husband went on and on about how paranoid and controlling I was to basically be ""demanding"" a copy of the key to the new house but again I stated that I was just trying to be helpful and taking extra precautions since anything could happen but he insisted I overstepped and ruined Ethan's and Jess's joy for their new house as well as dinner.

I genuienly do not think what I said was out of line and I'm not sure why Jess reacted so intensely. I think my request was innocent.",yta
"title: AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?
content: My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

"title: AITA for banning my MIL from the house after I discovered that she's installed a camera in the bedroom?
content: 

My husband (M33) got into a car accident almost a month ago, He's been bedridden due to a back injury and I've been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue. She visits everyday but doesn't do anything to help, alternatively, she'd list all the things I should or shouldn't do. The family keeps telling me she's just worried sick for her son so I try to stay calm.


Days ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this. She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong. I ended the conversation but my husband is upset telling me I'm being vindictive and that if his mom can't come then he'll move there with her. We argued then I went outside and he's been silent eversince.

"title: AITA for being honest about how I was bullied and how the teachers at my school did nothing about it while being interviewed by a current student?
content: I’m an author of mild success. I’m not incredibly popular, but my books sell enough. About 3 months ago, someone from my old high school reached out to see if a student could interview me.

I responded that my time at the school wasn’t the happiest, but I would give the student responses relating to my career. We had a great chat. She started asking questions about my time at the school, but I redirected. She caught on to what I was doing and asked “I’m sensing that you’re hesitant to talk about your time at (school). Is that true?”

I said let’s focus on the story, and she was like “Actually this could be a better story.”

So I said y’know what, sure. Whatever. I don’t owe the school anything, I’m not being paid, and even though it’s been a long time and I’ve grown from what happened, it’s still worth talking about. I mentioned a few names in specific, and how I’d tried to ask for help and was blown off by everyone. Teachers at my school very strongly favored the girls in sports teams, and would often be buddy buddy with them and their parents.

I mentioned a teacher who openly mocked the way I dressed, my lack of athleticism, etc. I brought up the time that a group of girls followed me around the school mooing at me and when I broke down crying because they wouldn’t stop and tried to tell a teacher, the teacher called me “Moolly” for the rest of the year and when I yelled “MY NAME IS MOLLY. *MOLLY”* she had me suspended for a week.

She ended up publishing the whole interview. Nothing exactly went “viral” but there were posts on FB with a ton of comments and it caused some commotion in that community.

A few weeks later, I was contacted by a school official who chastised me for bringing up old wounds and trying to paint veteran teachers as bad people when they were going through difficult times already. The teacher responsible for the “Moolly” incident had a local lifetime teaching award taken away from her after it all came out, so was it really worth it, and maybe did I remember things wrong?

Finally, a handful of my old classmates (many of them stuck around town) found me and I was barraged with a ton of messages telling me that I’m ruining the reputation of the school and of several prominent community members, it was X years ago so why can’t I just get over it, etc. Some of them obviously haven’t changed.

It was a long time ago, yes. I don’t know how I really feel about how this all went down though. I know times are tough for teachers right now. I didn’t set out to hurt anyone, I was just telling my truth. AITA?

**Edited:** So... I didn't expect this to be so overwhelmingly in favor of NTA. I wasn't looking for validation, but wow. Some of you are sending me heartbreaking stories of bullying and being ignored or gaslit, and I am so sorry. Thank you all for the responses. If the Mods want to take this down because of validation or whatever, please do. I have my answer. ",nta

My sister (26) brought her new boyfriend (30) over to our parents house to meet him for the first time, My wife and I came as well.


We met the dude, he seemed ok-ish at first but he then started asking weird and personal questions. My wife had a breast cancer and got a single mastectomy last year. She told the story to my sister's boyfriend and he was like ""oh"" then he stared at my wife briefly then ""playfully"" said ""without even asking, I can pretty much tell which one got the blow"". We were floored, My wife could barely keep a straight face. she lied so she could leave the table cause she was literally about to tear up. I just looked at the dude and said ""Are you serious?"" he said ""What??!! I was just joking bro"" I started asking him to explain the joke to me, He just stared. I asked him again to explain it to me in details but still got no answer. My sister asked me to stop because clearly he got uncomfortable, but I insisted he explain the joke to me cause clearly....my wife and I didn't get it. Things got awkward with him avoiding eye contact while I just stared at him the entire time. I still insisted and asked him to explain the joke right there and then, but seconds later he said he needed to step outside to make a phone call. turns out he got in his car and left. My sister had a meltdown screaming and berating me for how I treated her boyfriend. Calling me hostle with anger issues to scare her boyfriend out of our parents house. I told her he was overstepping and made my wife uncomfortable to the point of crying, She actually called me wife ""such a princess"" and said she is soft and can not take some teasing. I had an argument with her and my parents intervened, I took my wife and left.


My dad called me later and said that he understood how hurt my wife felt but my sister's boyfriend was visiting for the first time and I showed hostility and agression instead of just ignoring him. He encouraged me to reach out to him and my sister later and talk it out but I declined.

AITA? Edit: My sister and my wife don't have a history but my sister tends to ""see"" the worst in people. When my wife announced her diagnosis, my sister actually thought she was ""faking"" because the family no longer brought up my wife's miscarriage months prior, I thought that was out of line and she apologized for it and we moved on. My sister thinks that the only ""bad trait"" she sees in her boyfriend is his smoking habit, she says thatvotherwise, he's ""perfect"". smfh.",nta
"title: AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering
content: Today I dropped my dog off to get neutered. He's a six-month Goldendoodle. This was part of a ""puppy package"" of care, which covered all necessary shots and wellness checks, and culminates with neutering and microchipping. I came back a few hours later to pick him up. While receiving the aftercare instructions, I was informed that they pulled a few of my dog's teeth by the vet tech (VT). Our conversation went something like this:

VT: The only thing not covered by the puppy package is $20 for the two teeth we removed while he was under anesthesia, so if we can settle this up...

Me: Excuse me, you removed teeth? He was here for neutering.

VT: His two canines were starting to come in but the baby teeth were not loose so we removed them. It's very standard and what the vet regularly recommends.

Me: Well, you did more than recommend it - you went ahead and did it.

\*silence\*

VT: I'll be right back.

...now it's important to note that I don't care about the $20 charge. Had I been contacted and told that they recommended this, I would have OF COURSE went with the vet's recommendation! But come on, at least act like I'm involved in the process rather than making me feel like I'm being suckered into a forced up-sell situation. A few minutes later, she came back...

VT: I spoke with the doctor and we are going to discount the $20 since we did not consult you first.

Me: It's not about the $20. I'm more concerned about the fact that I came here for one procedure, and without any conversation or discussion, you expanded the scope of the visit to include tooth extraction.

VT: It was necessary. If we were to have done it at a separate visit, it would have been $250.

Me: I'm not concerned about the money if it's necessary. I'm concerned about not knowing about it or approving it beforehand.

VT: It's a very routine procedure. We regularly extract teeth while puppies are already under anesthesia.

Me: If it's so routine and done so regularly, why was it not discussed at one of the many prior visits or even this morning?

VT: You know if we didn't extract the teeth, it could have lead to issues with alignment, bacteria, and other complications.

Me: I'm not debating whether the extraction was necessary. I'm upset that I was not consulted first.

VT: I'll be right back.

...this time she brought my puppy back with her. I thanked her and left. To be clear, I was not trying to be rude, difficult, or cheap in any way. But I got into the car with my poor sedated pup feeling like I was being rude, difficult, and cheap. I spoke with a few coworkers after I got back to my office, but I could use some other opinions as well. So, AITA for being peeved about surprise tooth extractions during neutering?

&#x200B;

\*edit: this has, obviously, gotten way bigger than I had ever thought it would. To anybody that posted on here to vent their spleen and then hit the front page, you know what I mean... that being said, I wanted to offer a few points of clarification because I've seen quite a theme in the comments:

1. Most important of all: my puppy is snoozing next to me and seems to be in overall good shape - for that, I'm grateful to the vet.
2. It amazes me how many of you post things like ""you're obviously NTA, why would you even post this""... scroll the comments and look at some people on the other side. The reason I posted this is that I was conflicted and was wondering what people thought - and wow, you folks did not let me down.
3. I don't plan on talking about who the vet/clinic/hospital is or where it is located. I was not pleased by their customer service, but I am not trying to hurt their business in any way (I will not even post a negative review even though I will be changing providers).
4. I'm not upset about the fact that they made a decision that they thought was necessary. I'm upset that they could not explain that decision, or perhaps felt it was unnecessary to explain to me. Please keep in mind that I'm not a vet. I went to school for history and business. If someone had explained things to me, I might have quickly calmed down and the situation deescalated. This would have been best handled, in my opinion, had the vet came to speak to me.
5. For the men that are messaging me thinking I am a woman: I'm not.

To maybe lighten the mood a little bit, how about a laugh at how silly a Goldendoodle's shaved arm looks? [https://imgur.com/Zh8hBQ8](https://imgur.com/Zh8hBQ8)",nta
"title: AITA for being “too honest” about why I don’t drink?
content: I’m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. 
It was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife’s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I’ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. 

My flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, “Mark.” I’ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we’re “friendly” i honestly don’t know him that well. But you can tell he’s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.

Mark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. 

Mark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I’d politely decline. It’s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I’m either drinking a soda/water and it’s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me “princess”; I don’t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.

All my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he’d forget about me. But every now and then he’d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn’t want to drink. 

My wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I’d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he “understood now”. 

Mark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that’ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I’ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, “actually I don’t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.”

Wiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. 

Our flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn’t his fault he didn’t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he’s the only one right now that’s taking Mark’s side.

He said I could’ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. 

Now yes I could’ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that’s none of his business and a “no” should’ve been enough. 

I only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",nta
"title: AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam?
content: 

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.",nta
"title: AITA for breaking my promise to my stepkids, and ""abandoning and traumatizing"" them because I did not want to parent them anymore?
content: I met ""Will"" when I was 22. Will was 29, with 2 kids, and had newly been widowed. We had whirlwind courtship where he introduced me to the kids and got me involved in their lives VERY early (first few days after I met him.) Will said really quickly he was sure I was ""the one,"" not only for himself but also for his kids. That we'd have an incredible, happy family life. We got married when I was 23, Will was 30, and his kids were 8 and 6. Our wedding ceremony also included me and the kids making promises to each other, which was Will's idea. 

Soon Will shoved ALL the childcare onto me. I wasn't a stay at home spouse, I worked full time and always have. But he always had ""reasons"" for me to do the childcare - him being sore from doing a physical job, me being ""better"" at it since I babysat kids this age in the past and he never had. Or ""girl stuff"" for his daughter. Or cooking or anything. He always had some reason and it ended up always on me. 

He started playing video games and ""relaxing"" from getting home until bed, because he was ""tired"" and he was ""bringing in the money and keeping the roof over everyone's heads,"" though that wasn't really true. He said he DESERVED to relax. Then he went out with his friends or brought them back to drink beer and watch loud TV. 

He developed a major attitude with me, and encouraged same in the kids. They found it funny. He started openly disrespecting me and encouraged them to also. He was the ultimate ""fun dad"" and I got put in the role of the mean witch. Sometimes they all ganged up on me and mocked me. But also all expected me to serve them and constantly be jumping up to care for them.

By the end of the first year I realized the marriage was a big mistake, but felt guilty leaving because of my promises to the kids. Another year went by and I realized that no matter how I tried, and how I knew they were only kids and I didn't really blame them, I genuinely hated both of the kids. And I could not lie to myself any more and pretend that I loved them. I did not, and I never would. One day I just walked out, packed up everything of mine and moved out while nobody was at home. I left a note explaining it wasn't working and saying goodbye. That was the end. 

Cue shitstorm from my ex and a bitter divorce, but we both walked away with what we went into the marriage with (not much for either of us). I had never legally adopted the kids so I had no rights or responsibilies about them and I never reached out to any of them again. Honestly I was overjoyed to be rid of all of them.

15 years have gone by and that seems like a lifetime ago, or another person's life, but I'm still in my 30's. I was recently shocked to get a message from Tamara, Will's daughter, now 25. Tamara said I betrayed and traumatized her for life for ""abandoning them"" after my promises to them. She said I had a ""responsibility to never leave no matter what."" I know she remembers the horrible way she treated me though.",nta

So, they called my parents to tell them about the emergency, and then called me. They asked if I could come into their house, take care of their baby, until they came back, and I was down with that. I’ve taken care of babies before, so, this wasn’t new to me.

Took my stuff, and drove to their house, stayed with my cousin. Now, by the time my morning class comes about, my aunt and uncle haven’t shown up yet, which was within expected (they told me they’ll be back by one-two PM), and I had my baby cousin in my lap, setting up laptop for my morning class, and my cousin falls asleep, and I’m like OK. I can deal with this. A sleeping baby is the best kind of baby. Do not move them. 

Now, here’s the problem. I had a presentation to do, and so my video is off, as I’m preparing to give it, and the professor goes “OP, please turn on your camera.”

“Uhh. I have a sleeping baby right now, so… is that okay with you?”

“A sleeping baby?”

“Yeah, there was a family emergency, so my cousin’s asleep on me right now, um… I don’t want to say the details in class, but I can email you after class, and supply any proof you need.”

“It’s fine, please turn on your camera.”

So I do, and my cousin is asleep, and I give the entire presentation, and I’m really proud of how it went, because I think I did really well, and I answer all questions, and my cousin doesn’t wake up! Like this is the best case scenario.


Well, last night, I got my grade for the powerpoint, along with an email from the professor that says she marked me down because she felt the baby was there as a pity prop, and I was attempting to gain sympathy, and if I hadn’t had the baby, I would’ve gotten higher.


So was I the asshole for showing up with a baby? I didn’t think about the pity aspect.

edit :- sorry for the sporadic replies. i am still a university student balancing my shit. few clarifications. Yes, I did send her the proof she would’ve required to see there was an emergency. Yes, I will be reporting - and updating. Yes, there are better ways I could’ve done this, but a stressed and sleep deprived student isn’t normally the best source of judgement. The class was a philosophy one.",nta
"title: AITA for bringing up my brother's ""premature"" birth at Christmas dinner to get my parents to shut up?
content: I am a nurse practitioner and I am the primary care provider for a lot of the low risk maternity cases at the practice where I work.  I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. 

My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  

I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  

So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  

My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  

So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.

"title: AITA for buying lower grade steaks when my in-laws visit and serving my mom and dad Wagyu.
content: My wife and I live far away from both of our sets of parents.  We visit them a couple of times a year and they visit us about the same.  

My mom and dad love food. They will buy pounds of garlic and leave it in a rice maker for a month to make black garlic. They plan their vacations around amazing restaurants. 

My in-laws are lovely people but boiling chicken drumsticks is fancy for them. And they refuse to eat steak that isn't well done. 

I discovered this the first time I went to their home for dinner. I wasn't even asked how I like my steak. Everyone got a well done steak. 

It took me years to convince my wife to try a medium rare steak. Now she loves them. 

I bought some beautiful prime steak for them when they came over when we moved in together. I made theirs medium well, and I died a little inside.  Her dad took it back to the grill and destroyed them. So now I buy Select grade meat. 

I've been buying some excellent quality Wagyu for when my parents visit. Not every single time. Maybe once a year.  

My wife says I'm being an asshole by not treating both families the same. 

I don't think I should waste money on great food for them when I know how they will treat it.",nta
"title: AITA for calling my mom when my husband refused to listen to me?
content: I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.

The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week. 

When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. 
I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it ""wasn't that bad"". My reply was ""fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up."" Completly exhausted
I fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.

The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.  

When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.

That lead to a fight where I told him. ""I am too sick to have company and they need to leave"".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.

My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. ""Since your family can stay so can we."" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.

I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.

Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode.
My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.

My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.

SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. 
Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight. 

My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick.
Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.

Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful.
Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died.
Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. 
He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. 
He begged me for another chance. 
The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita.
 We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.

Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",nta
"title: AITA for calling out a secretary and threatening to report her to her manager after she revealed health information?
content: I got a needle stick injury at work (Im a healthcare worker) and my family doctor filled out a lab requisition for baseline bloodwork to be done. One of the tests is HIV.

I went to an external lab to get it done because my family MD office is closed. It’s a typical diagnostics lab. In the waiting area there are 5 other people sitting down.

I go to the secretary and hand her the req forms. She takes them, checks me in, and I sit down.

After 10 minutes she calls me back calling out my first name and says, “Ma’am there’s an issue with the HIV test form.”

EVERYBODY in the waiting area heard and gave me looks. I go up to her, very angry, I told her you cannot just announce people’s personal health information like that.

She says, “Oh its ok, you are getting tested just because of a workplace injury.” I told her that’s fine, but other people don’t know that. What if I had to get tested for HIV for a more personal reason? What if somebody who knew me was in the waiting area and heard I was getting tested? 

She apologized but I told her I will be calling her manager and informing them of the incident. She rolled her eyes and said “Go ahead.” in a mocking tone.

I told my husband what happened and he said maybe I should cut her some slack. But I told him, revealing personal health information is a huge violation. Its something that was drilled into me as a healthcare worker. I am appalled that the secretary was so blasé about it. I don’t care if she gets reprimanded or loses her job, this is not something to mess around with.

"title: AITA for calling out step-family’s dirty laundry at Thanksgiving after they criticized me for being unmarried?
content: I’m still getting shit for this from my family so it’s possible I may be a bit of the AH here.

I’m 29F, the players are my mom, step-dad, and four step-siblings (35M, 37M, 40F, 42M) and their families.  I’m the black sheep in that I’m the only one not married with kids, but that’s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don’t want kids, and having a partner just isn’t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I’m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been “ew, never”.

I was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I’m not anxious to have kids since I’m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said “Nah, I’m good.”  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn’t appreciate. I said let’s move on, but my mom said “We’re just worried about you.”

This is where I’m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, “Well, I’m the only person at this table that’s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I’m not the one to worry about.”

And that’s how I brought Thanksgiving to a dead halt and no one said a thing for the rest of dinner, but my texts are radioactive still.

I feel like it was probably riding the line and my mom says this has caused a lot of problems among the siblings, but also they kinda started it.",nta
"title: AITA for canceling the family trip because my stepson damaged my plants?
content: 


I grow indoor plants and keep them around the house whether by the kitchen window or out on the front porch. I have a variety of plants like Lily, aloe vera, also flowers and they all require care and attention. It's a hobby of mine and because I don't own enough space I just stick to indoor planting.

I have a 16 year old stepson Sean who loves to pull all kinds of pranks and has been trying some weird-prankes on me lately. I don't mind it as long as he's happy and also because nothing is too serious just hiding my farming tools/replacing them with damaged ones and so on. He just keeps messing around like any other kid. days ago he posted a FB video of him spraying cold water on me when I was sleeping. It was embarrassing since he shared it with family. I got mad at him and had him delete it despite him begging me to let him keep it. He kept sulking afterwards and had his mom try to convince me to let him repost the video but I thought that was crazy request. Sean suddenly became friendly and asked if he could water my plants, I was glad he asked and gave him the watering can and told him to start with the plants in the kitchen. He was gone for few minutes then he got back and started watering all the plants in the house.

Later in the evening I was cleaning my tools and there was a weird smell coming from the watering can. It smelled like bleach. I freaked out and checked my plants and the same smell was coming from them . I confronted Sean and asked what he watered the plants with. He acted dumb and said nothing but I found a bottle of bleach in his room which made me lose my temper. He admitted watering my plants with bleach to get back at me for making him remove the video. I was mortified I immediately canceled the weekend trip to the national park that he was looking forward to. he started crying saying it was too much and he made a mistake in moment of clouded judgement. I refused to discuss it, My wife feels bad Sean hasn't been eating well since I canceled the trip but he damaged my plants and caused me hurt and pain. She thinks an apology was enough, he is a kid and made a mistake. She wanted me to let it go but I said canceling the trip is his official punishment, Period I got called unreasonable and stubborn for this and that I don't respect her as a parent too and said taking away the only thing he cares about the most and look forward the most reeks of ab%$&se.

Sean has this mentally that if he admits doing something wrong then he'll be forgiven. This isn't how it should be but his mother thinks admitting to it and apologizing should be the end of it.",nta
"title: AITA for cancelling my son's birthday party upon discovering that he ruined his stepbrother's deceased brother's hoodie?
content: 
It's a complex situation but I'll do my best to explain.

I M45 have a bio son 'Leo', 16 from my previous relationship. I married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'Connor',20 (deceased) and 'Derek',12. I've never had the pleasure to meet Connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. Derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  I've seen tons of pictures and videos of Connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share Derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. It's safe to say that Derek and I grew a strong bond in no time. But my son Leo isn't close to Derek. Understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. Leo and Derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but Leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about Derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'Advice'. Derek never complained so I had to step in and tell Leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding Conner and his memory. Leo would say ""OK I get it"" and ""I won't do it again"".

Days ago, Leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked Derek if he wanted to join. Derek agreed and put on Connor's hoodie before going out. Leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but Derek insisted on wearing it or not go. Leo dropped it.

Hours later Derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. He said Leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. I was furious I asked Leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since Derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. I reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said ""so what, maybe this will help him move on in life"". I told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.
He pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and I can't cancel it. He had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but I refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. She and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how Leo will hate me for this but I insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.

Note: the hoodie belonged to Conner when he was younger and Derek kept it.",nta
"title: AITA for cancelling the family trip after I found out that my wife cancelled my son's ticket?
content: Situation is a bit messy so bear with me.



I M42 have two boys, Adam 16 & Leo 14. Their mom passed away 5 years ago and I married my wife Rose about a year ago. Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.

What she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of ""he wouldn't be I interested anyway"" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.


I'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his ""moody personality and introvert nature"" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.


1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.

2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.

3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.

4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind ""last minute"" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.",nta

"title: AITA for changing the door locks back after my wife changed them?
content: I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. 

Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. 
Between my wife and my sister.

Update* sorry I haven’t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.

I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn’t allowed over without me home. 

I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it’s clean.

The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife’s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.

Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.

I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.

Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife’s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.

The big thing is she had my wife’s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife’s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn’t valuable it’s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.

Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. 
I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn’t have that key.

Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.
My wife said “have her meet me every morning at 5 am.” I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife’s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife’s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.

My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.
I can tell it really hit her that her life isn’t as hard. Even being grounded.

Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.
1) for awhile no family at our home
2) no family borrowing our things. 
3)no one is allowed a key
4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.
5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. 
My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn’t want to cause more issues but she just doesn’t trust my sister and can’t have her using out things.",yta

When we arrived there was a lady with her 2 sons and a daughter, I made eye contact with the lady and just smiled and waved at her to be nice. After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore 

I looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with ""My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem"" I then responded with ""I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers"" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said ""Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not"", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car 

Later when I got home I told my mom about it thinking she would see it as a funny story, boy was I wrong, she started going on about how I was so rude to that lady and that I need to learn to respect my elders

One of my best friends of over ten years lost her battle with the big C word on Christmas. Fuck cancer, y'all. I'm not handling it well, tbh. I feel like a really crazy person. I literally haven't stopped crying. 

Through all the tumultuous emotions, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. 

I don't know why, but I felt like I wanted to get rid of a psychological weight and my hair was suffocating me.

 I 'model' and I've been doing it pretty much my whole life. My family is upper middle class due to my income. My parents 'work' as my mangers, even though I had actual, hired, experienced managers throughout the years. My dad works part time elsewhere, but I am the main breadwinner in the family. 

Part of my current contract was that I can't cut my hair without prior consent from managing parties or else my contract could be rendered void. It wasn't really an issue until now.

For a week, I tried to get consent, but nobody wanted to give it. So, over the weekend, I locked myself in my bathroom and chopped off almost all of my hair. I didn't go as extreme as 2007 Brittany, but I was definitely channeling her energy. 

Now I look like Steve from Stranger Things. 

I don't feel a lot better, but it was kind of cathartic. I'm glad I did it. My life changed, and I physically reflect that now.

Now I'm unemployed, though, cause I was released from my contract and as soon as I'm done with high school, my family wants me gone.

I know that I jeopardized my family's financial security, and my parents are scrambling to figure out how to pay the bills because I may have been an immature asshole, but, I dunno, maybe it's grief, but I feel pretty apathetic about it. I wanted to grieve in my own way.

Am I the asshole for that?

UPDATE: 6.35PM

So I talked to a few folks today, and I was sent a copy of the email exchanges that ultimately ended my contract. 

My contract was set to expire in June, but I wasn't booking until May to give myself time to finish up my last semester in high school. Instead of terminating my contract or 'firing me', i was released from my contract in a really nice way. 

I won't copy/paste, but the gist is;

Here at Company we value the health and safety of all our employees and it seems that Brittany is going through a hard time. Let's release her from her responsibility so she can enjoy school, and should she decide to come back after high school or freshman year of college, she'll be welcomed back into the agency.

They even sent a .pdf of therapists or counselors that I might wanna talk to. 

I talked to my old manager and she set me up in contact with a lawyer and already has access to copies of my documents, which she sent me in .pdf, too. I also contacted Jasmine's mom, who said that I can move in to finish hs if I'm kicked out in March. 

I'm not gunna say much, but what my parents were doing was definitely illegal unless I have trusts, which I doubt bc my parents both have nice new cars and stuff.

I also emailed my school guidance counselor. 

I have a new email contact, and I'll be sent my financial records ASAP. 

So... yeah. Posting this morning, I honestly felt like an ungrateful, whiny teen who fucked over her family, but you guys made me realize that my life is *definitely* not normal or fair, and I thank you all for that, and for the immeasurably kind words you've all given me.

I'll keep fighting!

"title: AITA for deciding I won't give any Christmas gifts this year after my mom cancelled a transaction on my card?
content: I'm still angry over this and I may not write very well, and also I probably don't judge the situation very well being this angry so I came to you.

I'm a student. I have a student bank account, where my college gives me money for transport (when we had physical classes) or scholarship. These kind of bank accounts have no fees, but are age restricted (can't have one if you're over 25) and need an overseer. When I asked the bank about it, they told me it's just a security thing so I chosen mom because she's more tech savvy than dad.

Well through some incredible luck I managed to get only top grades last year so I was awarded a study scholarship. Great! I've been saving it up, looking forward to word wide Black Friday, eyeing an amazing drawing tablet. I do digital art on very old intros, the tablet I was eyeing is as big as my monitor, is a display one and all around amazing.

Black Friday rolls in, and Amazon Germany (closest to me) has it in stock at an amazing price! A price I could afford! I was so damn happy, I ordered it. 

Then I got a notice that the bank refused the card. I emailed Amazon (their customer service is so fast) and we went over the card details and such making sure it was alright. It was and they advised me to call my bank. 

It was odd, I had bought things online in the past with this card and it went through. I had enough money for it (even extra) so I thought maybe they had technical difficulties. But it was too late in the day to call and they don't work weekends, so I left an email.

Only to find out today that for ""big transactions"" they ask for agreement from the overseer and that mine cancelled the transfer. I was like wtf and confronted mom about it (who throughout the weekend acted oblivious) and she told me that of course she couldn't let me ""throw money on something I don't need"" and that ""I wouldn't have money for Christmas presents if I bought that"". Then she had the audacity to ask me what I was planning to get my family this year.

I told her that they won't get anything more than a bread shadow* from me and I went to my room and cried on the carpet. I missed out on the offer, I can't afford the tablet anymore and it's all because mom wanted Christmas gifts. And no, I won't get her anything. Last year she got me a blouse too small for me that she later took for herself. She can gift herself this year too.

*Bread shadow= expression for nothing in my language

Edit: there are so many comments and I thank you all, I'm trying to reply to all of you but it'll take a while

Edit 2: thank you so so much for people offering me money in comments and dm but I can't accept that. I'm really grateful for you trying to help but I really can't take that. I'm really thankful for the offers and advice

#Edit 3: all hail u/Epic-Hamster!

So many people offered me advice, money, their tablets or other means of helping and I'm really thankful to you all! Also, lots of you told me to check the sale that's going on right now but the tablet I ordered wasn't on sale, yet u/Epic-Hamster found it (same specs different seller) at sale at an even better price than the Black Friday sale! I ordered it, it went through this time, and I'm so happy and excited!

Thank you, from all of my heart to everyone. I'm still going to reply to all of you, even if it's going to take me all night. Happy holidays for all of you!

Edit: it seems like I can't reply to you guys anymore sadly but if you want to you can send me a pm, I don't think I'll sleep this night anyway

#FAQ

(Now I really get why these are called frequently asked questions)

• This account I have to have because of my Uni, but I'm going to make dad the overseer and also open an account at another bank (a normal one) and transfer the money in small amounts to that one so I don't bother dad with it

• Also considering asking him just to be for form and the app to be on my phone so I'll be my own overseer

• I am an adult in my country, I'm 20, going to be 21 in April. The law asks my parents to support me until I finish my studies or at least until I'm 26, but I plan on moving out sooner

• I'll do gift my sister and dad, they have nothing to do with the incident and I love them lots

• I love mom too but can't put up with her attitude any longer

• Regarding what I'll give her, not sure yet but there are some amazing ideas in the comments

• She didn't react like that because she got me the tablet already, it's not her character to get me something she can't use. 

• Regarding the gift dad's planning on and which she'll claim is from both of them, dad is going to build a bigger enclosure for my lizard. 

• I may wrap my lizard's old branches nice and gift those to mom, as per Christmas traditions regarding naughty kids. And she doesn't like my scaly boy at all so double points I guess

• People saying that a drawing tablet is useless, thanks for your input but the question was if I was an A for the way I reacted and my decision to not give her a gift anymore. As it's my money I literary can do whatever I wish with it and a display drawing tablet is incredible useful for an aspiring digital artist as myself.

Thank you all who commented, I'll really try to reply to you all but you're so many! Thank you lots!

Edit number I lost count: Glad so many people like the bread shadow! It's a regional Romanian idiom! Would you eat some beans for us on 1st Dec? It's our national day, traditionally celebrated by eating beans with meat but if you're not okay with the meat that's okay too. I love you all!",nta
"title: AITA for demanding my mom apologize after she blew up at my girlfriend who she thought was being racist?
content: I’m black and my girlfriend is Filipino. My parents aren’t the biggest fans just because we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds and they don’t think I should be with a “rich girl”

My parents came over for dinner last night and my girlfriend was going to cook. Neither of us cook much and we eat way too much takeout, so she decided to make fried chicken because it is something she made with her mom growing up. Her mom came here from the Philippines and I guess it is pretty popular over there.

When my mom saw the fried chicken she thought that my girlfriend was either making fun of her or just going off a racial stereotype. She immediately started cussing at her and demanding an apology. I explained to my mom that fried chicken is popular in the Philippines and I googled it to show her that there are a lot of Filipino recipes.

She calmed down but did not apologize. I asked if she was going to apologize and she said it was just a misunderstanding. I said she should still apologize and she got offended, so I asked her to leave. I’m not talking to her until she apologizes but I don’t know if that is too harsh.",nta
"title: AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?
content: Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

As I'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. Like wtf?",nta
"title: AITA for demanding the same Christmas present my stepbrother got?
content: I sound like a real asshole but I've completely lost my mind over this.

I'm 17 and my stepbrother is 17. We both have our driving license.

I just found out 5 days ago that my dad and stepmom bought a used car for my stepbrother. They got me a 600 dollar gift card to best buy. 

I know $600 is a lot of money but what the fuck? Am I crazy or is it super unfair? It's literally the straw that broke the goddamn camel's back.

I'm actually so pissed off that I've moved to my mom's house full time.

My dad seems to be genuinely sorry and told me he's looking for a car now but that it'll take a while.

I messaged him back saying that I'll decide if I want to see him after he decides to be fair for once. I've ignored all other calls and messages from him since.

My stepbrother messaged me saying that I need to chill out and that he'll let me use his car. He also said that I need to stop bitching and ruining everyone's Christmas. I told him to get in his civic and fuck off.

AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for disinviting my brother to my wedding after he told me “being gay is wrong”?
content: Little backstory: I’ve been out of the closet since I was 17, in 2007. When I came out, people in my family said some pretty hurtful things, which I totally expected, being from a southern Baptist family in... god, it hurts to admit this but.. Florida😫. But my older brother at the time seemed very receptive, surprisingly. He told me that if my Dad ever gave me any trouble, to call him and he’d talk to him. That was really the last time we talked about it. 

Flash forward 13 years (I’m 30) and I’m getting married to my fiancé Scott next year in April (if covid so graciously allows). I started putting a package together of fun things from my brother And I’s childhood, all with the intention of asking him to be my best man. However, he called me two weeks ago, claiming he’s wanted to “talk to me about this for a long time”

He went into the long tangent about how being gay is wrong and isn’t “what god wants”. He said he thinks Scott is a nice guy and he loves me, but he doesn’t think it’s right that we’re getting married. It was quite a shock as Scott and I have stayed with him multiple times when we visit my hometown. To top it off (and what hurts perhaps the most), he said my three old niece, whom we ADORE, won’t be coming to the wedding because he didn’t “want to have to explain to her what was going on here”.

Notice he only said that SHE wasn’t coming to the wedding. I think he fully expected to still be invited after this. His wife, whom he started dating when I was 12, feels the same apparently. My whole dad’s side of the family feels the same way they do, but I’ve already written them off mostly in my mind. My mother is beyond pissed and upset at them. 

I think what upsets me the most is a sense of betrayal. They were my safe spot in the family. I felt like because they’re close to my age and younger and went to college, they would understand and it wouldn’t be a big deal to them. I almost feel a bit embarrassed because Scott comes from a wonderful Italian Catholic family and they’ve never been anything less than loving and supportive. 

I told them that, on what is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, if they or anyone else is sitting in the audience and in the back of their mind thinking that what we’re doing is wrong or not right, they should just stay home. I know my brother and family love me, but it feels up to a point, conditional, and limited. I told them that they learned being gay is wrong, they weren’t born not liking gay people. So they can unlearn it, if they were willing. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.

Edit: okay, legit did not expect this many responses. Been getting some interesting negative feedback. All I will say is that I was genuinely interested in hearing if anyone had an idea somewhere in between “youre the asshole, he’s family. Invite him” and “he’s the asshole, fuck him. Don’t invite him”. I’m a compromising centrist at heart, but wasn’t sure I could see where that could fit here on my own. 

And no my story isn’t fake. I recorded the conversation",nta
"title: AITA for doing weird/awkward poses whenever my MIL ""accidently"" walks in on me in the bathroom?
content: So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.


The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.


She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming ""she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel ""terrified/weirded out"" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.


Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a ""me problem"" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it 😅🤣 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow. Especially after what happened. Lol.",nta
"title: AITA for dropping our dinner on the ground and walking out when my boyfriend asked me ""What's for dinner tonight, b*tch?""
content: I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes ""what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH"" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. 

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!"" 

He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us

AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me ""what's for dinner tonight, b*tch""

Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:

> ""But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?""

Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. 

This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like ""Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)""

And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT ""UNDERSTAND""",nta
"title: AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?
content:  My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for eating my cupcake outside?
content: I have a 10 years old daughter who loves frosting. Every week I buy cupcakes for me, my wife and her and she always eats my frosting. These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to ""steal her frostings for weeks""

She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA?

Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah

Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here.

My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake

Nahhh lol

So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good

XD

Edit3: some people clearly didn't realize second edit was a joke because I keep getting ""no this didn't happen its fake"" messages. Yeah geniuses you are right",esh
"title: AITA for embarrassing a lunch thief at work.
content: So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up.

So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. 

I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. 

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.

He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.

He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.

Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA

Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.

Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. 

Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. 

Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. 

People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.

I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.

So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",nta
"title: AITA for expecting my boyfriend to replace all my socks, the exact same ones as I had before?
content: This might seem silly. I (24F) like wearing cheerful socks, since my uniform is all white (currently working as an phlebotomist), it usually cheers up the patients too. 

I've spent a few years collecting strange socks, ones with sushi, pizza, corgis, cats, Nick Cage, etc. I think I had about 30 pairs. My boyfriend (29M) has always hated them, and thinks they're childish. So I agreed to only wear them to work, and never on dates or around his friends/family. I thought that was fair. 

On boxing day his parents came over for coffee and gifts (just the 4 of us, which is allowed where I live, and keeping a solid 3 meters apart). I accidentally put on a pair of 'childish' socks, and his mother made a comment about it. I explained that I wear them to work to cheer people up, and she liked that. My boyfriend didn't. 

The next day all my socks were gone, and the drawer was filled with plain black socks. I asked my boyfriend, and he told me he threw them away and purchased some more 'appropriate' socks, so I won't embarrass him in front of his parents again. 

I told him that that's insane, they were mine and he had no right to throw them away. Not to mention that I spend quite some time collecting them. 

So I made a list of the ones I remembered I had, and told him that I expect the same ones as a replacement. He told me that's completely unreasonable, and that it would take a lot of time/effort/money for him to find those specific pairs. I haven't changed my mind yet, they cost me a lot of time and effort to find too. 

I think he's being controlling, he thinks I'm being unreasonable and demanding. 

AITA?

I think I might be an asshole for asking for the exact same pairs, I know that'll take a lot of effort to find.

Edit: Thanks everyone for replying, I've realised that this might not be a 'normal' fight and am evaluating the relationship.",nta
"title: AITA for exposing my parents' favoritism
content: My parents have always favored my younger brother. I was by no means unloved. But it was blatantly obvious who they cared about more. I worked a part time job to get my first car, but my brother got one as a present. It wasn't new, but was much newer than my car. It was the same with just about anything else, like clothes, video games and cell phones.

I'm 18 and am taking a gap year before community college to work a full time job and save money for tuition. But a while back I heard my parents talking about how much they were going to pay for my brother's tuition. I secretly recorded the conversation from around the corner and then came out asking my parents why they were gonna pay for my brother's college, but not mine. They didn't notice my phone was recording and just said that my brother needs more help. I asked how so when I wasn't getting any sort of scholarship, and he likely wouldn't either. Then I asked a few more questions about why things have always been this way. They got mad and my father told me that perhaps it's time I moved out because they are sick of keeping a roof over my head. I pointed out I pay rent. But they didn't care.

I left the room and in a fit of rage uploaded the video to two different social medias I have and ranted about how this is how my parents have always been. Well a few hours my parents were pounding at my door. My dad was screaming at me about how I made them look bad. We fought some more and they left the room fuming.

My grandparents contacted me later and said they were appalled, then came to visit with a lot of the family the next day. There was a huge family intervention and my parents were made to sit on the couch and look at their feet while being told off. It was then I found out they'd been receiving money for years from my grandparents to help with family expenses. My brother looked like he didn't know what to do. So he sided with the rest of the family and said he's noticed how I'm treated as well. My parents gave me a huge apology that sounded forced.

My grandparents have offered that I come live with them soon and will cut off the monthly payments to my parents, my father told me I should have never told the rest of the family and now won't talk to me, and my mother has been crying for days. So I'm starting to wonder if I went to far.

So AITA for exposing my parents favoritism?",nta
"title: AITA for filling a few faux Amazon packages with my dog's shit to teach the two theiving neighborhood kids who have been stealing my packages a lesson?
content: This has been going on for a few months now, ever since school let out. There are two girls in the neighborhood who are about 8-10 and the oldest about 10-13... I have a video camera outside our apartment and have caught them red-handed. The first package they stole contained puppy pee pads and garbage bags, second package contained a pair of scrubs for work and last week they got a Bluetooth speaker.  Amazon replaced all my packages and I would rather not get the police involved and their parents are real asshats that don't supervise their kids, so I decided to fill a few packages with dog shit and leave them something special to steal to hopefully teach them a lesson. I also taped notes that said "" Dear Children, Stop stealing my shit!"" in the boxes along with the turds. Some of the turds are petrified, some were juicy and wet. AITA or am I a diabolical genius?",nta
"title: AITA for firing my babysitter for getting drunk on the job
content: This is my throwaway account. 

My (37F) babysitter (16F) has been babysitting for me for about 2 months. She’s a very sweet and quiet girl and is good with the kids (4F and 8M), we’ve only had small problems here and there but nothing major at all. When she first started babysitting for me I had asked her if there were any drinks or snacks that she’d like me to keep at the house as she’s here from 9-7 every day Monday through Saturday. She mentioned that she really liked seltzer water and I had bought them for the first month, but honestly I forgot after a while and never kept any in the fridge. A few days ago I bought hard seltzer’s for me and my husband, and didn’t think anything of it. 
A little bit after 2 pm she messaged me that she wasn’t feeling well and thought that she may have to go home, if it was possible if I could get off from work earlier. I asked her to try and hold out until the end of the day. Not too long after she called me crying, saying that something was wrong and she had to go home. 
She was drunk clearly, she drank the hard seltzer’s. I told her to leave and she walked home. 
She messaged me the next day and said that she now knew that hard seltzer’s were alcohol, and she hadn’t know, she never drank before as both of her parents were alcoholics and she has diagnosed PTSD regarding alcohol, she never planned on drinking in general. I told her not to come back as she put my children in danger. She called me crying and saying that she didn’t know, and that she cared deeply about my children and would never ever drink with them, or at all, and that she needs the money to pay for her drivers permit (she comes from a not so well off family). I told her to find a real job and that it wasn’t my fault she got drunk. 
My husband says I’m being very rude and that she did try to reach out when she wasn’t feeling well. My kids are upset to see her go. 
So reddit, AITA?

Edit: okay guys, I’m the asshole. I see it now. Thank you. I’ll hire her again.

Edit #2: I will pay her $1500 a week from now on. And pay for her permit and test. As well as her license test.",yta
"title: AITA for forcing my son to use a bidet and threatening to talk to his friends or take him to the doctor about his underwear
content: For some reason my 14 year old son cannot wipe properly.  This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.  

Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.  

First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.  

I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand. 

He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.  

So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.  

I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.  I'm not kinkshaming him if that's his thing.  

He has started using the bidet but he says that it is gross and weird.  I said it was grosser and weirder for a 14 year old to crap his pants every day.  We are both stressed about his mom but this situation isn't because of her. I asked her.",nta
"title: AITA for forcing my tomboy daughter to wear formal clothing?
content: Hi all. My family is Indian-American, but I like to think I am pretty progressive. I (40F) have a son (16M) and a daughter (15F). My daughter has started to become a tomboy over the last 2 years, despises feminine clothing and style. While it has definitely been an adjustment in my perception, I have always tried to be as supportive as possible, and have let her pick her own clothings, only eliminating anything that was graphic or inappropriate.

However, my niece was getting married in a traditional, big Indian wedding. While generally all the girls would be wearing formal lehangas (Indian traditional dresses), I dropped it after asking my daughter if she wanted to wear that and she said no (only mentioned it once because she really looks up to my niece and I did not want her to feel left out). When I asked her what she wanted to wear, she said that should wear a t-shirt and slacks.

But, I insisted that she wear a formal clothing of her choice, whether it was a suit, a dress or traditional indian clothing. This was black tie event. I was making my son wear a formal suit. Everyone was going to be dressed to the nines. I was going to get my son a new suit tailored for the event, and I insisted that she come with and pick a fabric and suit style as well. It could be to her desire (as long as it was appropriate); like a very typical men's suit or feminine twist like what Zendaya wears.

She got angry and said I was constricting her expression. I think she will have to wear formal clothing in other points in her life, whether for work or other formal events. She can express herself however she wants but dressing appropriately for the occasion is a necessary skill. The wedding has been postponed for now, but I still want her to wear a formal outfit and she is still mad at me about this. AITA?

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this haha! Thank you for the comments and messages! While some of you have labeled me as the asshole, I think a lot of you are saying that I am not which is good to hear. But, I want to stress that I don't think my daughter is really the asshole (a little right now) but she is the sweetest little girl in the world (I might be biased haha). She is usually  very respectful, gets excellent grades and works really hard. I am very proud of her.

Some of you have mentioned there is an underlying problem that I am not seeing. I do not think my daughter is trans, but I think I have made it clear that its okay if she or anyone else is. She also generally seems pretty happy with her body; she is actually really fashionable and doesn't really wear baggy clothing or anything, but is more into ""streetwear."" She is the one who showed me who Zendaya is! Are there additional signs I should be looking for or things I should be doing?

I think she is at the stage in life where she knows everything, and I, her mom, knows nothing. She wants to rebel for something, but isn't really the type to rebel with something really bad (thank god), so she decided this is a justified area to rebel. She is also at home, and I haven't really allowed her to go out because of the current circumstances; so think she feels cooped up and now everything about me is annoying her.

That being said, a lot of you said to tell her she can't go to the wedding if she doesn't wear formal clothing, and I may be the asshole here, but SHE IS GOING. That is a thing I have decided to take a hard stance on. (1) because my daughter really, really wants to go! She loves her cousin and my family, and she is a really social person who would love weddings. Telling her not to go would hurt her I think and would be counterproductive in the longterm. (2) This is the first  wedding in our family and the first time my kids will see a traditional Indian wedding. They have never seen one before, so I think its important that they learn and feel connected to our culture. (3) If she decides not to go as an act of rebellion, I know my daughter, and I know she will feel really, really sad afterwards.

Parenting is hard, and I was always a girly-girl and so were all the people around me, so this uncharted territory for me. Thank you to all of you for your kind words and encouragement.",nta
"title: AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together?
content: I (M27) am married to a man (M28). He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it’s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",nta
"title: AITA for getting my daughter a hotel room entirely for herself after her stepsisters made her sleep on the floor?
content: My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).


While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said ""It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way.."". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm ""playing favorites"" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.

We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.


ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.

Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.



ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.

And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little. We're pretty much family and Candace is a sahm but I give her full access to my money since this stuff was already discussed before handed. Pretty much everything was.",nta

First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was ""real"" or just 'lenses"", also asked about how I spend my time when ""alone"" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying ""keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!"". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an ""attitude"". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.

I went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I ""ruined"" it for myself and cost him his job.

"title: AITA for getting upset with my husband after he told me nothing will change while I am pregnant?
content: Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call ""Jake"" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",nta
"title: AITA for gifting my sister pictures of my dog?
content: I'm a bit of a jackass I will admit, but hear me out. So today I was at my parent's house to celebrate Christmas Eve with my side of the family (as this year I will be spending Christmas with my girlfriend's this year). Anyways, we opened presents up early this morning. Something I should note about my sister is that she LOVES her children. Which is great and I do love my nephews, but every year she gets me magnets, pictures, blankets and pretty much anything she can plaster her kids on. 

While it's nice, I don't have a shrine at my house dedicated to them and I know this might sound selfish, but I don't really want them as I don't know what to do with them. They end up in a drawer or something, cause one year she got me a large tapestry thing with her kids on it, and it was HUGE. Obviously I didn't want to hang it up as it quite literally covered the entire wall. I never say anything to her as I don't want to offend her and ruin Christmas.

So that's when I had the genius idea of doing the same thing but with my dog. I put him in a little tie, took his picture and put it in a frame. I love my dog as my child, so I figured I'd gift it to my sister. (I also got her a $25 Starbucks card as she's obsessed with them and I wasn't trying to be petty). Anyways, she opens it up and her face drops. Then she goes to me and says, ""what the fuck am I supposed to do with this?"" Without a thought I said, ""same thing I do with yours, it'll look good on your coffee table"". 

Long story short, she got mad, my family is pretty much on my side expect for a couple of people who thought it was funny but in the end ""dogs aren't comparable to humans"". Which I don't necessarily agree with and wasn't the point of the gift, but whatever, I thought it was funny, but I need unbiased opinons, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?
content: I recently won a ‘fuck you’ amount of money. I won’t say exactly how much but it’s in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It’s enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She’s the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I’m not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven’t discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I’m disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I’m not *in* love with her. We’ve both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I’m feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don’t plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

"title: AITA for going home after I got told to sleep on the floor?
content: 

I'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend ""Carl"" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. My husband sometimes calls Carl his ""nicotine"" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.


Unfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. 

We planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.

My husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull ""Carl is a widower"" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.

They got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.",nta
"title: AITA for going into the ladies room?
content: I am a 31 yo man and was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do. I went over to the restrooms and saw that there wasn't a family/companion restroom, just a men's and women's. I went into the men's room and saw there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn't have a counter either.

I walked out and hunted down an employee to ask where the changing table was. She said it was in the bathroom, and I asked where, assuming there was a family/companion restroom on the other side of the store. She took me back to where I just was. I asked if there was another bathroom, and she said no. I told her I was just in the bathroom and there was no changing table. She asked if I was sure and suggested I look again.

I was annoyed, but I went back in the men's room. No changing table. When I came out the employee was gone. Keep in mind, my son has been in his poopy diaper this whole time. So I give up and head into the lady's room which sure enough had a changing table. There was a woman in there washing her hands, and she said ""wrong bathroom, buddy.""

I gestured to my son and said ""no changing table in the men's room."" She laughed and said ""bro, that sucks."" Then she walked out. So I rush to change him, hoping to be done before anyone else walked in. I'm almost done when a woman walks in and starts screaming at me. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she kept screaming ""Get out! You can't be here!"" Then she ran out.

I finished putting the diaper on and rushed out of the bathroom. I saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his carseat and left.

My wife said I absolutely did the right thing, but my mom said I'm an idiot and was 100% in the wrong. My sister won't stop laughing at me and is no help at all. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for going to the police over a 'prank'
content: Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",nta
"title: AITA for having my kids wear tie dye when with their dad?
content: I (30 F) my ex-husband (31m). Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. 
He wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.

My ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).
Since my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. 

My girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn’t want to take her favorite shirt over there.

I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be doing this good.

I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.
To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.
We had a “girls” tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. 

The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn’t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.

They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can’t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn’t want them to wear it. 
He called me an A for being petty.
AITA?
Edited to add. 
Thank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.
1) AP stands for Affair partner 
2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.
3) sadly this is a true story. I am sorry for those who don’t believe it. At the same time my heart goes out to those who shared your similar stories. Thank you for the love and support",nta
"title: AITA for helping my friend get a girl removed from the soccer team?
content: 
I (16f) have a friend named Aysha (15f). Aysha is Muslim and wears a hijab to school which often causes people to give her dirty looks, comments, etc. I don’t know why. It’s just cloth. 

Anyway the worst instance possible was with this girl named Megan (also 15f). When we were sitting together at lunch she came up to Aysha and I and told Aysha she dared her to take her hijab off, taunting her saying she would look so pretty without it. (This was with malicious intent because I told her one time thinking she was just clueless and wanted to educate her)

Then she forcibly tried to remove her hijab. I moved her hand away and we went to the principal. Instead of getting a punishment, Megan made up a sob story about how it would harm her position on some prestigious soccer club she was in. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. She makes a TikTok that said “when you get called to the principals office for telling the Muslim girl to take off her durag”. 

I was so livid for her. Aysha is very shy and didn’t want to seem like a buzzkill, so she asked me personally to email the soccer organization. Well, I did, and she was immediately kicked off and other organizations in the area were notified of her behavior. 

Now, all of her friends are in my dms saying how horrible I am, how I’m a retard, how I need to take a joke, etc. my parents think I should have stayed out of it. But I think I did the right thing.",nta
"title: AITA for ignoring an autistic guy on my flight?
content: AITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?

I'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. 
I tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.
 I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating "" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now"" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of "" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me."" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.
 
I feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.",nta
"title: AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?
content: My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’ 

AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can’t forgive her though.",nta
"title: AITA for insisting my boyfriend eat respectfully at a nice restaurant?
content: So my boyfriend (20M), L, and I (20F) have been dating for 7 months. We usually eat take out if we want to get something to eat. However, I recently was promoted so we went to eat at a VERY nice Italian restaurant to celebrate. Like, one with an enforced dress code. 

My boyfriend is not the nicest of eaters, which can be kind of gross but I deal with it. However, I didn’t realize he had no table manners. At the restaurant, after we were served our first appetizer, a beautifully plated bruschetta dish, L looked at me and jokingly asked me if I would be upset if he enjoyed his meal the same way he would at home. I told him that we were at a nice restaurant and there were other customers around. 

He didn’t say anything, but instead started digging into the bruschetta with his hands, ignoring the serving fork, getting sauce all over his fingers. I let this go. However, when the pasta came out, he smirked at me and ate like he hadn’t eaten in a week. 

He dropped his fork and started picking up pieces of chicken and noodles with his fingers, getting sauce everywhere: the tablecloth, his hands, his clothes and face. He didn’t miss the opportunity to loudly burp after he had finished destroying his side of the table. The table next to us was astonished. My waiter even asked him if he was ok. Other customers were staring. He also put his feet up on the chair next to us, blocking the aisle. 

I had no idea what to do. I didn’t want to make even more of a scene so I just asked for the check (which I paid) and left really embarrassed. On the way home I told him how embarrassed I was and he just said that it was my fault for not letting him enjoy the meal as he pleased and that since we were paying customers the other guests had no business judging us.

"title: AITA for kicking my SiL out after she threw away most of my single use baby products and even formula?
content: I'm 19f, I have a 3 week old baby girl. I do still live with my parents, but since I pay rent equally, they say I can have just as much of a say in who comes and goes from the house as they do. I've never actually taken advantage of this rule until recently enough. I have a brother, who's 26 and his wife is 24. They're ""crunchy parents"" to a 8 month old.

Basically what that is is fucking stupid, they use reusable wipes/nappies, think formula is the epitome of evil, babywearing, the list just goes on. I'm the complete opposite, pacifiers, supplementing with formula due to low supply, disposable wipes and nappies. They are completely against the products I use and often give me things like SiLs breastmilk in bags, disposable nappies their LO has grown out of, etc. I've used some but it's not really my cup of tea.

On Monday night, my bother and SiL were minding my baby for me since it was my birthday and my babys father (not together, very close friends and co parents) took me to get some dinner in one of my favourite fast food places. It was great and really relaxing. 

When I got home that evening, my SiL said that she did some cleaning and ""threw out anything I don't need"". This immediately gave me red flags but they were in a hurry to get out the door and left almost immediately. When I went into the nursery, every disposable nappy and wipe pack was gone and replaced with some reusable cloth ones. Same with my formula, there was 8 tubs and all of it was gone, I'm not able to replace them at the moment and soley breastfeeding isn't sustainable for us.

I was extremely angry and I just turned my phone off to avoid being mean to my SiL. She and my brother came over yesterday to collect something they forgot and that was when I confronted her. I told her she has to replace everything she dumped. When she said she can't afford to, I said fine, just get out and don't come back until I've been reimbursed or everything is replaced with the original items.

My brother thinks I'm being a massive asshole and he's on his wifes side. Our parents think im being completely reasonable here but they think telling her essentially not to come back is taking it too far. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?
content: I’ve known James since we were 11. He’s been my best friend for a long time and we’re so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

I had a crush on him growing up and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined and said we were just best friends. He’s really goofy with me, and treats me like I’m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and honestly, he’s family. 

A couple months ago I had a ONS and found out I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I’ve always wanted to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings, I’m in the right place in life and I’m so happy. 

When James found out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. Won’t go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn’t feel like going to the mall, can’t come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

My mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. He said ‘I know it’s really weird of me but it just creeps me out’ 

I found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and I haven’t heard from him since. I’m so upset that he’s ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! I want to reach out but I just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and I’m not sure if I’m the one that’s being difficult or if it’s him.",nah
"title: AITA for kicking my sister out of our family dinner after she made a ""practical observation""?
content: My brother 'Fred' and his wife 'Sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'Katie' and I when they announced that they were pregnant. However, we kept it to ourselves. A few months ago, Katie planned a family trip. Brother and SIL decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. This greatly irked Katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that Fred and Sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. This very clearly upset both of them.

Unfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. It has been a month, and my brother and SIL are understandably still devastated. Especially my SIL's mental health is not very well as of now.

Yesterday, I hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, SIL and our parents. Some time before dinner, SIL went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked Fred if she was doing well. Before Fred could reply, Katie jumped in and said, ""Well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. At least you don't have to worry about money anymore. As I said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.""

Fred went red-faced and said that they WOULD have been able to provide for their child. They may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. He was almost crying and purple with anger, so I quickly dragged Katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.

She got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. It was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. By that time, Sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see Fred in tears. She kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. I knew that Katie's presence would ruin things further, and I asked her to get out. She looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.

Fortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. When they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at Katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps I shouldn't have kicked Katie out like this. AITA?

"title: AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiancé that I cheated 9 years ago?
content: For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fiancé Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

Connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it’d be fun to act like college students again.

We all got pretty drunk and Connor had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement “Never Have I Ever cheated before” came up.

Now’s a good time to mention that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fiancé cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, I cheated on my “boyfriend” of 5 months. It was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

Well my brother knows about this so when I didn’t drink, he went “hey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated on (*insert ex’s name*). You have to drink to that!”

My boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn’t haven’t any of it and ended things on the spot. I’m numb. I’m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don’t know how I’m going to move on.

Connor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged me to stay and said he didn’t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn’t think when he said those words. I just can’t look at him right now. He ruined my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt. Am I being unreasonable?",esh
"title: AITA for kicking out my sister after she sabotaged a meeting with a fertility clinic?
content: 8 years ago, my (29f) sister (32f) got pregnant. The father wasn't involved and my sister didn't want the baby, but she also couldn't bring herself to terminate or adopt out to strangers. She approached me and my (now ex) husband, and asked if we would be willing to adopt her child. We weren't sure as we were concerned this would lead to issues down the line but my sister insisted that it wouldn't so we ultimately agreed. Before Lucy was a year old, my husband left us both because my sister lied about Lucy's father.

When Lucy was 4, I got together with my wife, and we married last year. My sister has said that seeing me and my wife with Lucy (who is now 7) confirms to her that she made the right decision.

When I first adopted Lucy, my husband and I told my sister that we wanted multiple children, which she said she was fine with at the time, but now my wife and I are looking into our options and my sister objects.

My sister has been staying with us since July because her boyfriend kicked her out.

She keeps asking Lucy if she's sure she wants siblings (Lucy has said that she does), and telling us she's worried we won't be able to give Lucy what she needs, and then today happened.

We had an online consultation with a fertility clinic to talk about sperm donation. We told my sister about it and asked her to keep an eye on Lucy while we talked. The wifi went randomly on and off 3 times during the session, booting us out of the call each time. The third time, my wife went to check it and saw my sister holding the power cord, and Lucy trying to plug it back in. Lucy saw my wife and said ""auntie keeps turning the wifi off"". Wife plugged it back in, but we could no longer get into the session and we got an email from the doctor saying that if the wifi is going to be this bad then maybe we should try a more local clinic as we can't do online consultations.

When we confronted my sister she admitted that she wants Lucy to be an only child so she has 100% of our undivided attention, and then said in a sarcastic tone ""forgive me for only wanting what's best for my daughter"" to which we responded that Lucy isn't her daughter. Things escalated until I said that my sister should go stay with our parents, and my wife drove her to their place.

Since leaving (a few hours ago) she's apologised and begged to come back, and my parents have also asked me to take her back, but I've refused. They've all called me an arsehole for kicking my own sister out after one argument, because now she's unable to get to work (no car and too far to walk) and she's back in her childhood room while at our place she had a studio to herself behind the house.

"title: AITA for laughing at my mom after she and my dad insisted i tell my friend’s boyfriend to leave my house?
content: I (F20) moved out on my 18th birthday and never looked back. I mostly moved out due to how strict my parents were. When i say strict, i don’t mean something like home by 10pm. I mean, I wasn’t allowed to have friends older than me (even by a few months) i wasn’t allowed any guy friends. If i had a project to work on at school and got partnered with a guy, my mom would tell my teachers to make me do it alone. I was only allowed on my phone if someone (mom or dad) was there to monitor what i was doing. Weekdays my bedtime was 9pm and weekends 9:30pm. I could only have sleepovers if it was at my house and all of my friends have to be questioned to make sure they were “clean” meaning, they didn’t have boyfriends, no tattoos, went to church, you get it. 

So you can imagine, i had literally 1 or 2 friends. By 18, i didn’t have any plans, i just packed my stuff and left. My parents weren’t happy and tried for months to get me to come home but i didn’t plan on it. Anyways, i landed a damn good job and was able to get my first apartment shortly after. My friend is over at my house almost everyday with her boyfriend and we just hang out. 

I didnt cut out all contact with my parents but i limit it to only only special occasions. My mom wanted to have a zoom family call whatever it’s called and asked me to join. I figured what the hell i’ll join and say hi. As i’m talking to my little cousin, in the background you could see my friend’s boyfriend come into the living room area. Everyone’s face kinda froze and i didn’t think much of it. 

My mom asked who it was and i told her and she immediately gets annoyed? She started asking why he was leaving my bedroom, which he didn’t. The bathroom is the same way towards the bedroom so i could see why it would look like he left from my room. She and my dad proceeds to ask me why i have guys at my home, why is he 21 hanging around me (i just turned 20 but yea) it was like i was 15 again

My mom then insists i have him leave. At this point my friend and her boyfriend hears this and goes like wtf? I didn’t know what else to do but laugh. I said “are you out of your mind” and laughed some more. I realized they were serious and said my goodbyes and hung up. Later i started getting messages that my parents are upset i laughed at them and my family says it’s in my best interest to apologize because i was being an asshole for laughing. AITA for laughing?

~~~
Edit- I did not expect to have this much feedback! Thank you everyone who took time to comment and a big thank you for the awards! 

For those of you asking why i would think i was the asshole, it’s mostly cause i laughed at them then hung up so i thought it was rude and asshole-ish especially after being told i was by my aunt as well.

I seen a lot of people telling me to go no contact. I’d feel terrible if i did such a thing but someone did point out they’ll never change their ways so i think i might have to. you know, i’ve got no idea how to set boundaries but i’m sure there’s a few articles that can help me with that. I did block them from all of my social media accounts except facebook so i think that counts? I’m not familiar with setting boundaries sorry

I found out from my little cousin that my mom has been asking where i live so now i’m kind of scared for that. Though not many know my address, if she ask the right people she might find out i hope not.",nta
"title: AITA for laughing in my brother and SIL’s faces when they demanded to use my credit card?
content: So I am 22F. I don’t have much knowledge about finances and stuff as I still live at home as I’m at university. I do however pay my parents about £300 a month rent, I pay my own phone plan, buy material stuff I want or need, pay out for other services like for music or whatever and try to put as much as I can in savings whilst still keeping enough in my main account for day to day purchases. Currently, I am saving up for driving lessons and hope that if I pass decently, I can use some of my savings towards getting a car. I’m in my final year of uni so I’ll be done and able to work full time when all this happens. 

I also decided to get a credit card so I can learn how to manage credit wisely and build some up. My credit score is good for someone of my age and circumstance but obviously it’s nothing great in comparison for other stuff. I should point out that at most I only plan on using this card with a total adding up to £100. Ive stuck to that so far and only actually used it twice with these purchases only adding up to £80 and I paid it off quickly. I do not plan on exceeding my limit any time soon as I’ve heard far too many horror stories of people just using their credit card too much cos it was handy and getting into debt.

The only people I disclosed this to was my dad as my mum has the tendency to blab to my brother and SIL (both 28.) She happened to overhear us talking one day and before I knew it, my brother and SIL got wind and asked me if they could use it. They both admitted they had debt spurned on by excessive credit card use and thought that since I basically had nothing owed on mine, it was “free money.” I told them quite politely that I was really uncomfortable with that idea and that I would owe the money and I can’t Magic up that kind of money. 

Things went quiet until a few days later they both turned up at the house. They were nice to start with but basically started demanding I let them use the card and they tried to manipulate by mother into guilting me into doing it. I got really angry and when my brother said I owe it to them because they used to babysit me up until a couple of years ago, I laughed in their faces and walked out.

When I came home, I learnt they tried to manipulate my dad and he kicked them both out. My mother then tried and he told her to go too and she is currently staying with my brother and SIL. The only person on my side is my dad who tells me they’re all trying to take me for a ride and they’re trying to manipulate me cos I’m young and they think I’m vulnerable. My brother, SIL and mum on the other hand think it isn’t a big deal letting someone else use my card. It’s really messing with my head and I just want everyone to stop being in an argument.

"title: AITA for leaving my babies inside by themselves
content: I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~

I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. 

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. 

I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. 

I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",nta
"title: AITA for leaving the call when my brother announced that his gf is pregnant?
content: My brother and I do not get on.

When we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.

There was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.

You really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.

I have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?

Anyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.

Yesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.

I just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.

I received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just ""been a man"" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to think

EDIT

I just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  

A lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.

The rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.

I think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.

Sorry I can't reply to all your comments but I've been trying to read them all. Thanks again Reddit.",nta
"title: AITA for leaving the restaurant before my boyfriend's family arrived after I was told that I was going to pay for their meals?
content: 

I (f29) have been dating my boyfriend (m35) 'Ricky' for 5 months. He's divorced but hates this word and goes with the word ""divorcee"" instead since the first one makes it sound like he was ""dumped"" when it was him who initiated it.


Anyways, He always go on long rants about his exes and say stuff like ""I hope you don't have this awful habit my ex has"" or ""hope you like XYZ cause my ex didn't"" and the list goes on.


I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.


Last night he invited his family to join us for dinner. We got to the restaurant first. He asked me if I ""brought"" enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said ""I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!"" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said ""well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway"" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.


I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute ""you're making money a priority just like my ex did"" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.

We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",nta
"title: AITA for letting my sister walk me down the aisle despite my fiance and his family's objections?
content: I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.

A few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.

My future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.

I told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.

I definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?

**EDIT**    
I did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  
**Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  
Yes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted. 

**Does your fiance have sisters?**  
No; he has two younger brothers.

**Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  
He did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. ""Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet"".  It was very sweet and cute. 

**What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  
Because of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life. 

**Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  
That was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest. 

**Your sister is amazing!**  
She is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime. 

**Please update us**  
I absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward. ",nta

"title: AITA for losing it and telling in-laws to stop calling me “mama” and trying to erase my identity?
content: I have 2 kids, 2f, 4f. I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don’t get to be my own person. I’m just mommy.

Husband doesn’t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! 

And like matching outfits. I don’t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I’m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they’re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?

From the time we got to the in-laws, it was “mama” this and “mama” that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said “You know my name is (Carmen), right?” she just looked at me funny and said “Of course, silly?” I said “So why do you keep calling me “mama”? You aren’t going around calling (husband) papa?” SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “Um, okay.” 

This went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? 

At that point I was just like “Do you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?”

The same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said “But you’re such a good mama!”

I said that I’m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said “Why didn’t you guys get him anything that says  “papa”? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?”

MIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just “so excited” about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.

I was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole “Are you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn’t healthy” faux concern thing that’s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.

The other one was angry and saying that “is being a mom somehow beneath you” and “do you think you’re better than the rest of us?” and all that.

When we finally left, he asked me why I’d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven’t. No one listened to me before. I’ve said these things plenty of times. I’ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I’d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.

I said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. 

We’re at a stalemate. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for making a big deal about 1 extra credit point on my child's test?
content: My daughter had a spelling test which included some holiday words for extra credit. One of the words was ""Chanukah"". My daughter spelled it the way I just did, but the teacher marked it wrong and corrected it to ""Hanukkah"". She said to my daughter ""you're Jewish and you don't know how to spell Hanukkah?"" I think she meant it jokingly but my daughter was annoyed. My daughter told the teacher that Chanukah is correct, but the teacher didn't believe her.

I told the teacher that Chanukah was also correct and that my daughter should get the point, and the teacher argued with me, saying that Hanukkah is more correct because it's more commonly used than Chanukah. I said if any spelling is more correct it would be Chanukah because the Ch represents the sound from the back of the throat you're supposed to make.

The teacher agreed to correct the test but seemed really sour about it and said she was just trying to be inclusive. I said I appreciate that but she should keep in mind that if the word isn't in English that there might be multiple acceptable spellings for it and that they should all be given credit.

My husband says I overreacted. Honestly I probably wouldn't have bothered so much if the word was something else, but I resented the teacher, who isn't Jewish, arguing with me and my daughter about how to spell our own holiday.",nta
"title: AITA for making an uncomfortable joke when my friend told me her dinner table was full with family?
content: Over the last 20 years everyone is my close family has died. Both my parents are gone, my grandparents on both sides, all my dad's uncles, and anyone who is still alive are scattered out among the country. All I(20f) have left is my siblings and my BIL.

My friend (23f) comes from a different family. All the uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents have monthly parties, stay in touch, have big celebrations, the works. All of them are still alive and active.

I think she knows I'm sensitive to the topic as I wish I had a big family, as she sometimes makes these comments like 'You know when you get married your guest list will be so small compared to mine...but hey at least it will be cheap!' At my mom's funeral there were still a lot of open chairs and she told me if this was a family member of hers all the seats would be full. (She is aware of my many, many deceased family members)

I took some pictures of me, my siblings, and my BIL cooking for Thanksgiving and us playing games at the dinner table and post them on social media. She text me privately saying we looked like we were having fun, followed by pics of her huge family, and remarked the dinner table was full of family. This is where I maybe the asshole, I replied, lovely! Have fun, we'd have a full table too but with the snow it's was too hard to dig everyone out of their graves.

"title: AITA for making homemade food for everyone except my brother's stepdaughter?
content: I (27F) am not a professional chef, but I have taken a bunch of cooking classes and love making elaborate meals for friends and family. About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen. 

Last weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick. 

I thought the ""take out"" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was ""unbelievable"" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party. 

I felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for making my parents choose between my sister going to jail or replacing my car with their vacation money.
content: I (f17) live with my parents. I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. 

They did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  

She has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  

My parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  

Well my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. 

I have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  

My sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. 

When I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  

After talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. 

So rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  

I just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.

"title: AITA for moving to a hotel because my wife's family insisted I sleep on the couch?
content: My wife and I got married last summer. Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.

They invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.

I honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).

After arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.

This morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.

About 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.

My wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.

AITA?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Wow, I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the responses and awards! I took the advice of one of the posters here to ask my wife and her sisters to meet me for dinner apart from their parents. It was interesting to say the least.

After we sat down, I leaned into them a bit about what had happened. I asked my wife if she knew her dad was going to demand we sleep separately, and she said she was surprised by it as well - she'd expect that if I were still just her boyfriend, but we're married now. I then asked them all if they thought it was OK for their parents to act the way they did. They said it wasn't, but they know their father and it's best to just let things like this go.

This led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me ""disrespecting him"" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.

I then asked if they thought this was even about house rules, because it seemed more like their dad was just trying to show me who was in charge. They agreed.

Up to this point I had really done everything I could to not escalate this situation, but I started to get really mad that they were all so afraid of how their dad would react. I decided I needed to push back a bit.

I know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents. They know that their dad is probably going to freak out when they leave, but I think they realized this situation had gone too far so they decided they would come and deal with the fallout afterwards.

So that's where this all stands for now. I'm about to check out of my hotel and hit the road for San Diego. My wife and her sisters are coming down in a separate car after their parents leave for work. I fully expect their dad to throw a conniption fit when he finds out they left without telling him, but I really don't care at this point. I tried to be the bigger person at every turn, but he pushed this all way too far.

Thanks again to everyone for all the insight.",nta
"title: AITA for my reaction when I learned that my fiance returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom picked for me?
content: My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.


Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

ETD Q & As

I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get.

A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type.

B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this ""vision"" has been there for...quite a while.

C. I AM paying for the dress obviously.

D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son.

E. He's still presisting...",nta
"title: AITA for my response to my brother in law's comment about my leg hair?
content: 

So, my f19, sister, f28 and brother in law came over with the kids for dinner at my parents house. 

I was watching my nieces while dinner was getting ready, we sat down and I happened to sit next to brother in law. I was wearing a skirt and it was accidentally lifted above my knee, my brother in law looked down at my leg and made face then loudly said ""Oh shooo, Op! This is gross, you should've shaved, that hair isn't supposed to be there"". Everyone stared, I told him ""if it's not supposed to be there then why does it grow there, can you explain?"" He was like ""it's just not supposed to be there"", I point at his mustache and say ""well, guess the same thing can be said about your little mustache then, huh?"". He looks at meeyes wide open, and awkward silence takes over though some laughed. My sister told me to knock it off as my brother in law got up from his chair and went inside the bathroom. My sister followed and I could hear him having a breakdown asking her if there was something wrong with his mustache, my brother and I kept giggling but dinner got cut short cause my brother in law wanted to leave. 

I later got scolded by my sister saying I stepped over the line and disrespected someone who's older than me, who's herhusband and demanded I apologize to him for insulting him and ruining dinner.


AITA?

Edit - Guys! My sister said the reason my brother in law got so offended was because he considers his mustache as a symbol of his ""manhood"" and so I insulted his ""manhood"" not just made a ""backhanded comment"". She said I psychologically harmed him and should apologize for it but I'm not sure if this fixes anything except how he feels about his mustachy mustache.lol.",nta
"title: AITA for my response to my sister's boyfriend's ""brutal honesty""?
content: 


My F35 sister F27 started dating one of those ""brutally honest"" guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.


I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might ""produce"" defective babies due to age.


I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his ""honest opinion"" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: ""trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!"". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.

"title: AITA for my sister ending her pregnancy and possibly her marriage?
content: I (m32) have two older brothers (m38 and m40) and a sister (f34). Note the age differences. Our dad passed away 5 years ago in our hometown (a more suburban town in Wisconsin).

Our family was relatively modest when my brothers grew up, so they were cared for a lot by my parent’s families who are very conservative. My dad personally, was not. By the time me and my sister were born, our dad’s career was doing great and we were well off. Me and my sister have Master’s while our brothers didn’t go to college despite the funds and chances.

My mom had been trying to set my sister up with a churchgoer’s kid. This didn’t progress until around the time my dad died and my sister came back and helped with the funeral. My brother’s families are both in town as well. I worked in tech in China then and live in SF now and since the funeral have been mostly LC with everyone except my sister. Honestly, I was very close with my dad and there was obvious favoritism towards me which the others didn’t like. So, my mom and oldest brother now technically live in my house.

My sister somehow ended up leaving her career and moving back. She married the man my mom set her up with in 2019. I honestly was in shock at the wedding. I really didn’t ever see my sister living on a farm and becoming a stay at home mom. I knew for a fact my mom and brothers had a huge part in this, because there were a lot of “she’s back home” posts. Later I found out that she had pretty much given all her savings to her husband.

Late 2020, my sister, straight out of the blue started calling me and just “chatting” about things. I of course, love this. Early in 2021, my mom told me she was pregnant. I immediately asked my sister about this and she kinda broke down. In short, the husband has been abusive, she’s broke and my family and her in laws haven’t helped. My oldest brother wailed at her about how his wife went through the same thing and my sister should stop thinking she’s special. The first time she called me, he had kicked her out of their home for complaining about their finances. This was fairly common.

This is where IATA: I basically yelled at her too. I told her that she had a career which she can still go back to and I can help her move back to NYC (where she worked / studied before). And that the pregnancy wasn’t the end of it and there were other options.

The next day she asked me for 5k which I sent to her without asking. I didn’t hear much after and didn’t intrude coz it was a total mindfuck. A month later my sister told me she had gotten a new job in NYC and filed for divorce. The pregnancy is also no longer on the table.

Now my family has been blowing up my social media calling me all sorts of shit. I’ve in general called them shit back as well and the home might be on the market soon. My sister needed to switch apartments and got a restraining order against her ex and well… things aren’t great, but I’m happy my sister is better. So AITA?

Edit: I messed up a date and fixed some grammar.

Edit: Wow, I just woke up and did not not expect a response like this. Thank you everyone, this helps a lot!
I saw a couple of posts mentioned they had been in the same predicament as my sister and I’d really like to say that you aren’t alone. Please, please reach out to those you have ever been close to.",nta
"title: AITA for naming my child the same name that SIL named hers just weeks earlier?
content: My SIL has never liked me. She had always tried to one up me. We were both pregnant at the same time. Her due date was 6 days after mine but her girl came early so she gave birth roughly 2 weeks before me. We had already announced our name because MIL wanted to make a blanket with baby's name in it.

SIL said their name was a secret. Well turns out they named their daughter the name we chose and announced. She thought she had won and I decided it wasn't worth arguing with her. I gave birth and we simply went ahead with our name choice. It's a generic name like Sara or Anna but it's was also my mum's name which is why we chose it. So technically SIL could have planned for this name all along but I doubt it.

Well, she's not happy at all that the two cousins now share a name. I told her tough luck and why did she think we'd change our name?",nta
"title: AITA for not agreeing to a name change for my daughter, despite her father wanting one?
content: My ex and I were engaged, living together, and planning on trying for kids after the wedding. The wedding got delayed and I found out I was pregnant shortly after. My ex freaked out. Insisted it couldn't be his baby because he wasn't ready to be a dad, that this was all happening too fast and wasn't how we planned it, and said he needed some time to think everything over. He then moved out, blocked me, and didn't answer any kind of attempted contact for 10 months.

Our child was born without him there and I named our daughter, ""Elizabeth Laura Smith"" without his input. Elizabeth because I like it and it reminds me of my favourite book character (I work in literature), Laura after my grandmother, and Smith is my surname. My ex has reached out. He said he waited this long because he wasn't sure how far along I was when we were together but he figured the baby had to have been born by now. I said that his timing was a little off, because she's 5 months old.

Ex has said he's planning to sort out custody. We've not discussed logistics yet, but he's unlikely to get anything before she turns 1. He asked if I'd named her yet, and I told him what I'd named her.

Ex then said he hates that name. He thinks it sounds old and stuffy. He says that as his mother, ""Mary"", has recently (November 2019) passed away, he wants to name our daughter Mary. He says Mary *must* be the first name and that I can have either Elizabeth or Laura as the middle name.

I made clear, in no uncertain terms, that I will not change her name. I hate the name Mary. I hate how it sounds, both alone and with ""Elizabeth/Laura Smith"" on the end of it. Plus I didn't like his mother, either (though I didn't remind him of that).

Ex said that if we're going to co-parent then I have to learn to compromise and this is the place to start, and that it's unfair that I got to choose both her first and middle name.

I said that if he hadn't blocked me for the better part of a year, he'd have been able to say all of this when she was born.

Ex said that the above is proof that I'm being petty and that he can't undo the past, but I can prevent any feelings of dislike/resentment from him over this name in future, and that as the father he should have a say in his daughter's name. He also says that he's willing to let her be a ""Smith"" and not force me to use his surname, which he feels is proof he has already negotiated.

"title: AITA for not answering work emails while on vacation resulting in the loss of a client?
content: My husband and I took a much needed vacation to the beach last week and the entire week before we left I sent emails arpund letting everyone know I'd be completely inaccessible for the week so to come and see me for any work materials needed, files etc. I gave everyone everything I knew or thought they'd need and left confident that everyone had prepared themselves, seeing as I'd given them 8 days to prepare.

When I returned I found chaos in the office. Apparently one of my colleagues had needed files for a particularly important client of ours and had not been able to find them in my office and I never responded to calls or emails, as I warned I wouldn't do. This coworker knew they'd be handling this client and had 8 days and 12 hours a day to ask me for all pertinent files and appears to have not.

In any case, I was blamed because the client is technically mine and I am supervisor of this coworker.

I contend that I am blameless because this coworker had 8 days to collect all their files like their other coworkers did and they neglected to do so. No one seems to care about that.

AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for not changing my rules and terminating care?
content: I have a home daycare. I like to think I’m pretty lenient but I do have one big rule: Don’t make me the bad guy. I understand we might have different rules but don’t make your child resent me by not backing me up.

Anyway, another rule is I don’t allow outside toys or electronics. Kids can bring a stuffed animals for nap if they’re sleeping on rest mats but I don’t want to be responsible if something gets broken. Years ago, I used to let kids bring whatever. Then a cheap McDonalds toy broke by accident, kid was upset and mom got mad at me. So now it’s a hard rule.

Most are okay with it. But I have a new kid (3) who’s mom wanted him to bring his tablet because “he needs it”. I said sorry but no. I’m not going to be responsible for it. We went back and forth but finally she just says fine. But every morning, he’s crying because she took his tablet from him in the car. She always gives me this look and says “Miss Lucy says no tablet.” I always try to say we have plenty of toys, but the kids spends the whole morning sulking. I’ve talked to mom, asked her to leave it at home and not even put it in the car but she says he “needs it”.

It’s been a month and yesterday was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Kid came in crying as usual. I tried my usual redirection which didn’t work. Mom was giving me a look of “see what you did”. Then she had the nerve to say to him “I know you need your tablet, we’ve talked about this before, Miss Lucy is strict”. That pissed me off. I ended up telling her to take him home right then and there. She was shocked and tried to stammer. He was my first kid of the day so there was no scene. I just handed back his backpack, said he was no longer a student of mine and began to pack his extra clothes and the sippy cup he kept. Mom was in tears as she left.

My husband thinks she was right. I’m too strict and should’ve broken policy instead of causing drama. AITA?

Edit: There was no medical need for the tablet. It was all just that he wanted it.

Edit 2: I’m not making a waiver for electronics. That won’t stop other issues with the tablets, such as jealousy and drama.

Edit 3: Who reported to Reddit Care that you think I’m suicidal?? Where did you get that?

Edit 4: So my “don’t make me the bad guy rule” has been misunderstood, partly as I worded it poorly. I don’t expect blind obedience. No one has to agree with my rules. They can challenge them, to me. But to their kid, I’d rather them explain everyone has different rules and that while they’re with me, things will be different.

I do the same with parents who have different rules than mine. I never say they’re wrong or strict, I say that we have different rules at school and to listen to mom and dad.

This is also a policy for pacifiers, bottles and potty training. I’ll approach any of these milestones when you ask, but you have to be working on it at home too. The kid won’t progress if they only go pee on the potty at home.

And the child was not autistic or non verbal. If he was, an exception would be made.

I accept I’m TA for terminating with no notice. That wasn’t right.

Final update/edit: I returned her money for the last few days of January and texted an apology for terminating without notice and said I hope she was able to find care. She said she left him at her mom’s. She also asked if there was anyway I’d reconsider and I said no. We had a long phone call and no minds were changed, but it was the ending we SHOULD have had.",nta
"title: AITA for not cleaning while I cook just to prove a point to my husband?
content: I've always cleaned as I cook so that when it gets to the end of the meal, there's minimal mess. My husband is the opposite. When he cooks, it's like a bomb went off. I've encouraged him to clean as he cooks, and if we're doing a big meal/holiday meal together I often make sure to assign him that role.

Like most people, one of us cooks, the other one cleans up. I am the better cook, so I cook like 80% of the time. He gets an easy cleanup.

I'm busier than usual at work, so he's had to step up. Whenever he's done, the kitchen is a mess. I don't even get how it happens, there will be oil splatters untouched, stuff drying to dishes, peels and meat. I'm not about to let food sit out overnight so after I'm done eating I'll start the process and won't get to really relax much.

Last week I asked if he could please try cleaning as he cooks. He told me ""the rule is one person cooks, the other person cleans."" I said ""I get that but you're leaving me with a huge mess every night.""

He said ""I just don't have the time to clean up when I'm focused on cooking"" knowing full well I'll see him scrolling on his phone.

I just got so fed up, so on Sunday I made a big pot of chili. I didn't clean up as I worked, when I was done, I served him, sat down, enjoyed a beer and dinner.

When he finally went into the kitchen, he said ""What the fuck? Why is there such a mess?""

I said that I was too busy paying attention to the chili to clean up. I started to get ready for bed. He was like, ""Uhh you're just going to leave this here?"" and I said yes. He said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a game with his friends later that night, so could I just clean up.

I said no, I cooked, so he has to clean.

Two days later he's still pissy with me because he ended up not being able game and told me that he didn't get enough sleep and was exhausted at work (not to be TOO snarky, but it's not like he's a surgeon) because I had to ""prove a point"" to him. I told him that nothing else seemed to get his attention, and I feel pretty justified. He told me I was being a smug asshole about it and it was childish.

AITA? Or is he?

**EDIT:** A couple of people asked how we can make so many dishes, it should take 15 minutes, etc. We don't have a dishwasher (there's no room for one), so everything has to be done by hand. Additionally, ""doing the dishes"" means cleaning up the counters and stovetop and sweeping the floor, taking out the trash if need be.

When I make chili, it's a process starting w/ dried chilies that I toast, soak, seed, pulverize, etc. Then there's cooking the dried beans, then there's the onions and garlic and the peels, any other veggies, seeding tomato, cans of tomato, grinding the spices, etc. Then there's grating cheese for the top, etc. It definitely left a ton of dishes and other stuff behind.

**EDIT 2:** Sorry guys I was reading comments as I was at work, I thought this would get like... 10 comments tops. So another thing that comes up is ""whoever cooks also cleans"" but since I cook most of the time, I just don't see that as being also fair to me. I'll end up spending almost every single day after work (I've been ending work at 6 or 7 some days lately) cooking AND cleaning. If I had him cook more I would definitely start to gain weight and then we'd have another issue altogether HAHAHAHA.

**FINAL EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Oh and sorry to the people on ""AmITheAngel"" for the ""humblebraggy"" way I mentioned I make chili. Didn't mean to make you guys feel inferior because I toasted a few chilies. Lmao. ""Oh it's so fishy because she used dried beans"" Makes sense why people are asking for my recipe if the concept of toasting chilies and using dried beans is so novel. Lmao.",nta
"title: AITA for not giving my brother and his wife any privacy?
content: My brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28M) and his wife (30F) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. I hesitated at first, considering I only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course I invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.

For the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. Then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. The living room is by far the biggest room I have, so I told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/TV/bookshelves.  The living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so I reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.

It's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. When they first moved in, I would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. Now whenever I go in, there's a strange vibe like I'm intruding. My brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when I go in (I always knock) and stare at me pointedly until I leave. Sometimes when I sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.

This came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. The timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.

I basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no WAY I'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. She sent me back a HUGE message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. 

I tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when I got home neither my brother/SIL were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. Today an Amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which I told him there's 'absolutely no way' I will allow him to install. My brother says I'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.

"title: AITA for not giving up my second ""free"" seat next to me in the plane?
content: I am obese. Like I am comfortable having two seats in the plane type of obese. I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. 

A week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. 

So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like ""Fucking fat bitch"" under her breath but nothing directly to me. 

So Am I the asshole for insisting on him to leave?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my cousin experience motherhood?
content: I have a cousin by marriage (husband's cousin) that's 22 and dying of cancer. It was always her dream to marry and be a mom and now that's not going to happen. It's hard on everyone. She has a much older fiance (30) and they had a symbolic wedding so she could have the experience.

They started looking for ways to get access to a baby that she could take care of and experience some level of child care that way, but with 2020 and ethics in general, there's not a lot of ways to do that safely. My husband and I have the first and so far only children of our generation, who are 10 months and 23 months old.

I had hopes that it wouldn't happen, but her parents asked me if she/they could borrow my younger baby for ""a few weeks"". The cousin and her fiance would basically be playacting having a baby. Her parents would also join in on pretending. There would be photoshoots and everything. This makes me really uncomfortable.

It's really creepy. I cannot understate how creepy I think this is. I know that her not getting to live her dreams is sad, but I don't think this is the answer.

I'm worried it will be traumatic for my baby. She's almost a year old and will, well, notice that her entire family will just vanish overnight for what will seem like forever. She's also still nursing, and they don't really seem to care about this factor.

I'm really worried about problems down the road. This is setting a dangerous precedent of my child living under other guardianship. Her parents will have time to get attached and they could try to use that for familial pressure if not legally. Her fiance is also a wild card in that regard.

I said no, and my husband's entire family is hounding us about this because her time is running out and it's time sensitive. They say we're being selfish. They say that we could use this as a free vacation and bond with our older child because I ""popped them out so close together"". They want to compromise now by letting me come by a few times a day to bring milk. We still don't want to do this. AITA

EDIT/UPDATE:

Yesterday afternoon, we got an email from the cousin's parents offering actual dollar amounts for us to agree. We got enough from that to file a police report and at least get the threat in writing. We also had a call with my husband's parents and his siblings to basically clear the air. Apparently what they were telling people they asked for and what they were actually asking for were very different. Everyone on that call now had them blocked on social media except for MIL (because of the cousin).",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my girlfriend wear her “unique” dress to a wedding?
content: UPDATED! 

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! 
Ps: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey’s name, won’t happen again lol",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my miracle baby niece be my flower girl at my wedding?
content: My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant. 

Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH. 

Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.

Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes. 

So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.

She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.

She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should ""honor her"" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece. 

Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said 

""Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?""

She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm ""letting her down"". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway. 

Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.

I'm firm in my decision though, and my fiancé is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down. AITA for not allowing my niece to be the flower girl?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my niece host her wedding at my ""castle""?
content: 28 years ago my wife and I combined our savings (most of which came from inheritance after my father's passing) and bought our ""castle"" in southern Europe. It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.

It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.

Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. 

Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.

I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".

My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. 

I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous. 

ETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my roommate wear something she stole from me?
content: Last night my roommate was about to leave for some fancy dinner she was attending at her boyfriend’s parent’s house and I noticed she was wearing my dress. I asked her if it was mine and she said yes. I asked her if she had gone into my room while I wasn’t there and taken it and she sheepishly said yes. Just to be clear, we don’t have that kind of relationship, we’re friendly but not friends, so this felt like a huge violation. I told her to take it off and find something else to wear. She began crying and said she had nothing else to wear that would work for the event. I said too bad if she had asked me first it would have been a totally different story. I’m not cool with her just taking my things without permission. She ended up having a temper tantrum and not going. Her boyfriend texted me later on and said I was an asshole. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for not letting my sister see her kids?
content: I (28f) obtained custody of my sister's (35f) kids (9m,4f,2f), back in 2018, after she left them alone for two weeks to go on a ""trip"" (read. drug bender). Of course this was a huge transition for the kiddos, they had to be moved schools and daycares, and of course couldn't see their mom anymore. Now, the kids are doing better and definitely lead happier lives. 

Recently, though, my sister was released from prison, and wants to see the kids again. She called me, begging to have a visit with them, and telling me that I could give them back because she was out of prison now. 

I've had a talk with the 9 year old, and he says that he doesn't want to see his mom yet, and that he still hates her for leaving him alone. The girls have no memories of her, and the smallest one was only three months old the last time she saw her.

I do feel like I could have helped them foster a better relationship with her, but I don't want to force the oldest into meeting her when he absolutely doesn't want to.

Still, my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother.

So, AITA?

Edit- I have spoken to a professional about this, specifically the oldest's therapist. They have advised that it should be up to him. I just want to know if I'm being a jerk to my sister. Also, I have adopted the kids, and have full custody of them.",nta

content: I'm 46M, my brother 48M.

When I was 20, my then girlfriend cheated with my brother. I was heartbroken and pissed. I told him he is no longer my brother. Despite my request, my family didnt cut him off, so I told them that I will never again be in the same place as he is. If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.

My daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.

I was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.

My ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected.

"title: AITA for not punishing my 7 yo daughter for her play-relationships?
content: My husband and I have a 7 year old daughter together, Layla. A few months ago, Layla got a ""boyfriend"", Lucas. They are both 7, so it's obviously not a real relationship. They just hold hands sometimes and they drew each other hearts for valentines day.

This week, Layla was apparently holding hands with another boy - who also sent Layla a valentine's day love letter - and Lucas took offence to it. We found out because Lucas' parents called to tell us Lucas won't be coming over to us this Saturday like it was originally planned, because he is mad at Layla.

My husband wants us to punish Layla and wants me to have a talk with her about faithfulness. At first I thought he was joking, but no, he was serious. He says that Layla cheated on Lucas and I, as her mother, should do something about it. 

I told my husband that Layla is 7, not a cheater and I won't treat her as such. He then accused me of ""raising a cheater"" and encouraging the bad behaviour. AITA for not wanting to punish Layla?

They got into a massive fight the other day while my wife was out. I guess a pair of my wife’s underwear got in with their laundry and she thought he was cheating. I think the fact she immediately jumped to cheating shows how bad their relationship is.

She was waving the underwear around and I recognized them because they had a floral print but I just let this ridiculous fight go on. My wife came home after about thirty minutes and said they were hers. My wife asked if I didn’t realize they were hers and I accidentally laughed.

"title: AITA for not shaving my legs for work?
content: So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.
AITA for not shaving my legs for my job?

EDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I’m not mad at him and don’t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn’t even force dress code and stuff.

"title: AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?
content: My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.

We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.

When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.

This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes. 

Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.

And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.

And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless. AITA, Reddit?",nta
"title: AITA for not taking my pregnant homophobic sister in?
content: My sister (20f) and I (27f) don’t get along. I’m gay, and when she was 14 she started being horrible to me, calling me slurs and saying I was going to burn in hell and other typical religious homophobic things. She is the golden child so obviously my parents sided with her, she would make me cry and they would tell me to deal with it and expected me to still be nice to her. After a while, I cut them all out of my life. Best decision ever.

3 years ago I married the love of my life, my parents were invited but they didn’t show, no doubt because of my sister. Still hurt. My wife L and I are both very lucky and have amazing jobs and a big house. About a week ago, my parents and sister showed up to my house (no idea how they know I live there) and wanted to talk to me. Turns out sister’s pregnant and they essentially want me to let her move in for free AND pay for everything for her and the baby. There was no apology for anything. I was in shock and my sister was going off about how we have so much space and we could afford to help her out.

I said no. I told them we couldn’t take her in because we currently have L’s two little half sisters staying with us because their mom is very high risk, so we don’t have anymore space. They were pissed and were going off about how I was supposed to help my family and that I was choosing L’s family over my own, I told them they were not my family. I told them everything they had done and say to me and they said I needed to let it go and move on. I asked them to leave. Even if we had space I wouldn’t want her here.

Since then I have gotten so many messages from them and other family members saying I need to help them and take her in. I reminded them of what she has been like to me, and they say I need to be the bigger person and that this will bring us together. Thing is, my parents are going to have to take money out of their retirement fund if I don’t help. They were good parents growing up, when my sister started her bs I was already out of the house. So people have said that i would really be helping them, not my sister. L said we could give her some money, but I don’t want to do that either. AITA?

Edited because I forgot to add that I don’t feel for her at all, I just feel bad about my parents.


Update - thank you all for the kind words! We are not taking her in but might give my parents some money in the future if we see they are struggling. 
Also, my sister is 7 months pregnant and just recently told my parents because she couldn’t hide it anymore, so they are desperate because there’s no time to save up now. My mom just sent me my sister’s baby registry and I can’t believe her!!! She is living off my parents and doesn’t have a job but is asking people to get her a $300 car seat and a $700 stroller.

Edit - Please don’t post this anywhere.


Edit- Wow! I came back to like a thousand more replies, seriously thank you all for your advice. Yes, I know my parents are also to blame. They have never been ‘homophobic’ but they never told her off because they wanted to ‘keep the peace’ and I know that’s a shitty excuse but I would only see them like once a month while my sister was there full time and they never want to upset her. And the wedding - my dad called me because my sister was upset she wasn’t invited and asked me to invite her but I said no so they didn’t show up. 

The main reason I feel like I need to help them is because they put me through college. I got a scholarship and my parents paid for the rest which was still a lot of money. My sister went to a community college so they didn’t pay nearly as much for her.
Thank you all again!",nta
"title: AITA for not telling my cousin my fiance works at the same office as her husband?
content: First/only post, I mainly lurk. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.

I have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of ""just trying to help"", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. 

I'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)

Kat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to ""let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding"". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.

Literally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment ""tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering"". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my ""duty"" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was ""blindsided"" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting my disabled sister at my wedding?
content: The title sounds awful but please read all the way til the end. DO NOT SPEED READ THIS. 

My (22f)  sister ""Anna"" (21) is ""special need"". She has severe autism and while she is verbal most of her communication is ""physical"" like sign language  due to her social discomfort. She does speak around family though and has pretty bad cognitive skills. She can't comprehend boundaries and lives with our parents so they can best watch her. 

I am getting married in 3 months. We planned a simple wedding and reception at my fiance ""Michael's"" parents barn and farm. Since it's all gonna be DIY and we aren't planning anything too expensive,  we can do things pretty quickly since flowers, food and decor will be provided by his family. 

I sent out invites last week and I asked that Anna not come. I told my parents I understood that would mean they may not show up but it was just a heads up. Why no Anna? She has an issue with touching Michael and trying to kiss him. At times when we were at my parents house Anna would try and grab Michael's hands, try to lean in to kiss him or would have a really bad shutdowns if she wasn't allowed to be directly next to him. We've tried speaking to her but there's only so much we can do when she doesn't really understand. I told my parents I just want one day for Michael to be *my* partner and not Anna's comfort person. They called me selfish and asked how I expected them to agree to something like this. They told me Anna is disabled and may never experience a wedding of her own and while I have Michael for probably the rest of our lives she'll have no one and that Michael and I can be a little more understanding to the reality of her life. 

I feel like a total ass and what they're saying has really gotten to me and I'm starting to question my decision.  AITA?

Update: My parents called me letting me know they won't be coming and that it's best I don't bring Michael around anymore since I've ""chosen some man over my sister"". They told me that Anna wanting to kiss Michael and hug him is normal for a women her age and that she doesn't understand what her feelings mean. I suggested they try to redirect her during the wedding but they said Michael is gonna be family to her and he needs to ""get over it"". I suggested they watch the wedding via web and they said that's not fair and that they deserve to see things in person. I asked if *I* could pay for someone with proper credentials to watch her that day while they attention and they asked what I would do when they died and if I'd pawn her off every time. I dropped the unfortunate truth bomb that I don't want to put any more of my life aside for Anna anymore. I did it up until I turned 18. And that Anna is not my life's responsibility and I won't be her keeper. I assured them I'd pay for her care but if she's okay doing this to Michael then I worry for if I ever do choose to have children and what she'd do to them 
 They said I was sick for suggesting she'd do anything to my future children and hung up on me. They sent a lengthy text telling me not to contact them until I could ""do the right thing"".  So thts where we are right now.

PLEASE READ: This is NOT an excuse to talk badly about disabled people's nor is this an opportunity to air out your hatred for them. My sister is not a scapegoat to hate disabled people. She is a human being with feelings, she is not a statistic, she is not evil. Please stop treating my sister as if she's a malicious monster, this debacle is between me and my parents. Leave her out of it, please. I am begging you, I don't want to hear why you think my sister sucks.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting my parents to adopt another teenage girl
content: I (15F) live with my parents (mid-40s) and my brother (9M). It’s always been a dream of my parents to adopt (me and bro are bio-kids) and they had come to the decision that they want to adopt an older kid. They got matched with ‘Jess’ who is 13. Due to the current situation, she is not living with us, but we’ve met before and she’s spent a weekend with us in January. Jess, despite sometimes being sweet and kind, is very high maintenance and has a lot of anxiety and anger problems. She can go from 0-1000 really quick. During her stay, she got triggered by something when we were in public (she and I went to a clothes shop and my parents were in a cafe nearby - some guy accidentally grabbed her by her shoulder as he thought she was his daughter, and he apologised immediately) and started screaming. I was the only person there, and I tried to calm her down but she ran off.

She was found (shaken, but safe) an hour later. I then got grounded as I had failed in being responsible for my ‘sister.’ I said I didn’t have a sister. My parents were angry about this and said that how dare I be rude about her, don’t I know how much she’s been through. She’s had other outbursts, but none so huge in public. She can be cold and untrusting and was very clingy to my parents. I do admire her, and think she’s very brave - but I don’t want to live with her.

My parents call Jess often. I often say hi, and try to be civil and supportive. But it seems like the only thing my parents can talk about is Jess, and how brave she is, and she isn’t even here yet.

We live in a 3 bedroom house, and my parents promised to move to a bigger one later this year. Recently, my parents broke the news to me that Jess will move into my room, and I can pick whether I want to share a room with bro, or Jess. I don’t want to share with either. My brother is messy, loud and is your average 9yo boy and Jess has night terrors and screams the house down, and it’s enough having to open my house to her, but I value my privacy a lot and don’t want her in my room, which is like my special place. I was crushed. I asked if we were still moving, and my parents were like, ‘We like this place and have no solid plan.’ I freaked out and was like, ‘You guys are forgetting you have another daughter and are too excited about the shiny new one to remember that the one you have has feelings and boundaries, and if you’re changing everything I’ve ever known, at least I deserve to be listened to. If this is how life’s going to be, I don’t want to have a sister.’

Good to note: my room is big enough to have a wall put in, and my parents considered it a few years back. I would be happy with that. They refuse, even though we can easily afford it, because it is ‘too much effort.’

My parents are offended that I’m ‘not being welcoming’ towards my ‘sister’, and I’m offended that the life I knew is going to be turned upside down, and I’m not going to have the thing I value most, my privacy. AITA?

Update: this blew up... enough to reach jess. she called me and we had a good heart to heart. she was unaware of the situation, and felt really uncomfortable about it. we had a family meeting via skype to explain to my parents why this was a bad idea, and showed them some of the comments in this thread. they apologised and they said they would try to improve their behaviour. we asked to put up a wall, and they agreed. my father is currently watching a video on how to do it lol.

jess also says hi to everyone - and thanks you for looking out for her.",nta
"title: AITA for not wanting to celebrate my mom on MY birthday?
content: I have three siblings between the ages of 10 and 18. I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.

Every year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.

I asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.

I thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/

EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to! If you'd feel inclined, I think it would be pretty cool to donate it instead to a cool charity of your choice instead.",nta
"title: AITA for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto FB who died during the 9/11 attacks?
content: I lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when TWC towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). I had no calls or texts from her, all I hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. This year I suffered a near-death accident. After it, I did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways I decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people I am close with. 

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here? I genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, I just wanted people to know what a great person my late-GF was.",yta
"title: AITA for pretending to be an ""Appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?
content: I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

But, did I go too far?

"title: AITA for pretending to get fired when customers get a temper with me?
content: I am a high schooler with a weekend job at a coffee shop. My coworkers who work weekends are: 

James - the owners son, he goes to my school. He's a shift manager but it's not a real formal thing, he's a friendly guy.

Danielle - A college student who sometimes works weekends too.

So sometimes customers will come in and just be angry about such little stuff. Like literally blow up about nothing. I dunno if theyre in a bad mood already and looking for someone to take it out on or what, but it's a lot... Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.

So James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.

So one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.

So James came in and was like ""sir is there a problem here"" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like ""OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired."" 

I started acting real sad, like ""no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee"" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.

The angry guy started to backtrack, like ""It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it"" and James was like ""No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service""

Of course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and ""fire"" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences. 

Anyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.

"title: AITA for pulling my daughter from a waterpark trip because her teacher made her stay with a kid she doesn't like?
content: My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.

I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys. 

I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” *Fine.* I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.

What happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do *her* job. 

My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a ""buddy."" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.

UPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!

Second, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.",nta
"title: AITA for punishing my son after he said something racist?
content: About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M)  loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food. 

I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. 

That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.",nta
"title: AITA for putting a private conversation on loud speaker which cost my brother his 18 year relationship
content: Ok guys I’m extremely tried and it’s been a long ass day so please excuse any poor grammar or spelling mistakes 


To begin my brother Ben (39m fake name ) has been in a relationship with Abby(39 fake name) 18 years. They’ve been engaged 8 years they’ve nearly gotten married 3 years ago but months before the wedding Ben chickened out. 

They went to therapy and basically because our dad left us he has issues with commitment.
We thought over the last year he was finally gonna step up for Abby and be the partner she deserves. He did seem a bit anxious leading up to the big day but assured everyone he was ok 


Today they were meant to get married but as abby and us bridesmaids were about to enter the church Ben was no where to be found 

Everyone tried to calm her down saying it was traffic or he probably had a monster hangover.
Well an hour passed, than two, than three and than after the four hour mark Abby said fuck she was going back to the hotel call her when he landed.

My family looked panicked and nervous trying to get through to Ben or the groomsmen who had not arrived yet 

My other brothers and brother in laws (sister’s husband) went looking for him thinking he got hurt or arrested the night before 

I went back to the hotel with a very broken looking Abby. We drank and ate food for another hour before I got a text from my brother in law saying they found him in a bar and they were trying to talk him into GOING TO HIS OWN WEDDING. My sister rang her husband and heard him in the background  he was literally acting like a 5 year old who didn’t want to go to the doctor 

Honestly guys I had enough at this stage he mess this girl about too long and frankly leading someone along for 18 years is just cruel 


So he’s here’s were I maybe the asshole of the century. I walked into Abby’s room and told her be quiet than I rang my brother in law put him on loud speaker and asked him what was going on than for him to put Ben on the phone the drunk fool started saying shit like he didn’t think she was the one and he is only with her because they’ve been together to long and he is scared to be alone 

I let her hear everything I won’t lie I felt like a monster when she started crying. Abby than grabbed the phone told him he had one hour to get to the church or it was over for good 


Long story short Ben ended up at the Church 20 minutes later and Abby took off her dress than left the hotel alone 

So he ended being left a the Alter and she went on the honeymoon alone. I’ve been disowned by everyone expect two siblings (sisters) and I had to get Abby’s maid of honour to collect my suitcase from outside the hotel (mom dumped out when she found out) 

I’m the full blame for ruining their relationship and 98% of my family hates me",nta
"title: AITA for putting bacon on my lunch to keep my Muslim friend from stealing it
content: I’m not a super healthy person. At school for lunch, I usually get cheese fries. I know, very unhealthy. But one of my friends sure likes to steal my fries, as well as food from our other friends at the table. He’ll grab a bit from our trays and eat it when we’re not looking sometimes. It’s not usually a lot; it’s more so just a nuisance. So I had an idea. My friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is Muslim, and he keeps halal. Our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (I love America). I wouldn’t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but I would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend stealing my food. When I first sat down at our table, he said “What the fuck man? Why’d you do that?” My friends sided with him. They said I went too far by not “respecting” his dietary restrictions. Too which I replied, “his dietary restrictions shouldn’t matter if he doesn’t eat my food”. I think I was totally in the right to do that, but my friends just thought it was petty because I didn’t get bacon before and I only started getting it to give him the finger. Thoughts?",nta
"title: AITA for putting parental controls on my TV and royally pissing off my FIL?
content: I (M30's) live with my wife (F30's). We have two kids, M8 and F6.

My wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.

I don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.

My MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not ""college house party bass tearing apart the walls"" loud but it is still loud.

My kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.

My wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.

I've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.

My FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.

He complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through ""a bit of everyday noise"".

I told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.

I've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.

I decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.

My FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. 

I'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.

"title: AITA for recreating a ""secret"" cookie recipe the person does not give out?
content: My boyfriend's mom makes theses amazing cookie bars. She makes them for the holidays and family gatherings and people always request that she brings them. I asked for the recipe once and she laughed and said no - that it was ""hers"" and she doesn't give it out to anyone. I dropped it and never asked again.

I started baking a LOT during the pandemic. It's been fun for me in my downtime. I decided with my free time to try to recreate the cookie bars my boyfriend's mom makes. I pulled up recipes that sounded similar from online blogs and started baking and tweaking. It took about 5 recipes and batches but I finally nailed it down (her secret recipe ended up essentially being a cookie bar known as a Carmelita).

I then decided to make it ""my own"" and improve it to my tastes. I used higher quality chocolate, made sauce with local homemade caramels, used flakey sea salt on top, vanilla bean paste instead of extract, added a pinch of this fantastic organic cinnamon I had on hand. The results were over the top delicious. My boyfriend declared they are better than his mom's and he finished off half a pan in 2 days.

He was Facetiming with his mom Saturday and eating one. She asked what it was and he said ""One of your caramel bars. Jo found a recipe online but made it even better."" SHE LOST IT. She started yelling about how awful I was for making ""her"" cookies and how I had no right. He told her that she was overreacting and quickly ended the call.

She started blowing up my phone with nasty texts about what an asshole I am. I explained to her that I found the recipe I used online where it was very public, I had actually tweaked that to make it more my own, and that I wasn't ever planning on bringing them to an event she's at so I did not see what the big deal was. She didn't care. She called me names and told me I was wrong for baking a recipe that I knew was similar to hers. She isn't speaking to me or her son.

While I don't think my boyfriend should have made the comment about how I ""made it even better"" to his mom...taking that out of the equation she thinks I'm an asshole for even making them to begin with. I disagree, but from the texts from her and a couple other family members of hers, they think I crossed a line. AITA for recreating this recipe?

\*\*Edit to add this, since people are asking - and edit to correct that I make my caramel sauce WITH homemade caramels from a local shop:

I used the recipe below for the ""base"" for my bars, but then made the tweaks I mentioned above. I used high quality chocolate, homemade caramels from a local candy place, I add 1Tbs of vanilla bean paste into my caramel when I melt it, and a pinch (probably 1/4 tsp. or less) of a very mild organic cinnamon into the oatmeal mixture. I top it with flakey sea salt. They are GREAT the regular way though, because the tweaks I made to my last batch (the batch that got me in trouble because they were declared better than the inspiration) add up in price quickly.

content: My fiancé (m37) and I (f30) have started living together 6 months ago. I own a house and he moved in with me. I run online business from home which allows me to live rather comfortably. 
A month after moving in, he quit his job saying how much he hated it and that he’s going to try and do twitch streaming for a living. 
Im all for following your passion so I was supportive although surprised at the turn of events. I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.

Anyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel. Sure, he’s gaming all day but hasn’t bothered to even try and create an account, he just games for pleasure. It’s been 7 months. 
I’ve had conversations with him suggesting he finds work but he keeps telling me that I’m unsupportive and he needs time.

He wanted us to buy a bigger house together but I said that I’m fine with my current one and that since he doesn’t have a job, I don’t want to get mortgage and be left with paying everything and he told me that if I found a real job maybe I wouldn’t have financial problems.
We had a massive argument that night.
Now, he’s been hinting at needing new gaming laptop which costs a few grand and I’ve been ignoring it so he asked outright for me to buy it for his birthday.

I told him no that my fake job doesn’t cover new laptops and he got really pissed at me, telling me I’m selfish and am ruining his career.

"title: AITA for refusing to ''see other options'' for a girl and pressing charges for what she did to my son's car?
content: My (39M) son (17M) Bryce dated our neighbor Lana (17F) for a year, they broke up mid Jan for reasons I don't know. I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.

My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. 

He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. 

Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to answer to a nickname I don’t like?
content: Throwaway account and fake names. I don’t think I’m TAH here but one of my coworkers does and we both follow this reddit, so we’re letting reddit decide. 

I (28F) was named after a really obscure character from Greek Mythology. My preferred nickname is taken from the end of my name. I always introduce myself with “I’m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).” None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.

For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.

Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay. 

Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge.

I resent my father because my mother actually loved him and she is still dealing with this. Even 1 year after he left her.
I stayed on okay terms with him because I was the one to pick up and drop off my younger brother at his place.

Last week when I picked up my brother my father had big news. He proposed to his girlfriend and wanted me as his best (wo)man. It made me kinda mad ngl. But I kept calm... And told him no. He said that what happened between him and mom was none of our business and that I should respect his new relationship. I said I respect it but that doesn't mean I condone it. Obviously I would never hound him randomly about it but I don't approve of it and I don't like her. She knew the whole time my mom and we existed .

Well my dad was having none of it and told me to get off my high horse because I had cheated too and I had no right.
And I.... Guess?
When I was 17 I was with this boy for 3 months. I went to a party got shit faced and made out with a classmate for a total of 10 minutes. I felt so bad that I called my boyfriend crying and we talked it out. We broke up. I told my dad and In 10 years I never did something like that again. I have been with my partner for 5 years.
I told him he could not equate it at all. He called me a hypocrite. And that he was glad to know who I am.

Driving home I felt like I was a bit harsh. He is still my father and he is not a bad father. I just don't want to be in his wedding. I would still go. But AITA,?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to dye my daughter’s hair because her school complained?
content: My daughter(15F) dyed her hair dark reddish brown for her birthday.I didn’t let her dye her hair in middle school but said she could in high school. The school has a dress code for hair that just specified “natural hair colors only”. Which I took to mean browns, blondes, reds, black etc basically natural tones. Her natural hair is black but I don’t think it’s much of a change. The hairdresser that did a bleaching on her hair said it was not lighten enough to cause significant damage. 

But then one of the teachers in the beginning of the oct last year began complaining to me during parent teacher meetings that her hair didn’t meet dress code. I said her hair color grew out of people’s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter’s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it’s pretty racist to say she can’t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks “natural”. 

This went on until the end of the school year. I contacted the superintendent several times but she never got back to me. It’s almost the start of school again and I get an email from the principle reminding me my daughter is only allowed black hair. She still has her reddish brown hair and doesn’t want to dye it back. But I’ve tried to fight it and the last thing to do is to barge into the superintendents office and demand she get involved.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?
content: For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. 

I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. 

Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. 

Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",esh
"title: AITA for refusing to give this woman her grandma's wedding dress and jewelry back?
content: I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8"", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

Now she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to help my partner financially?
content: I(43F) have been with my partner(50M) for 6 years now. We have been living together for 5 of them. We are not married and we do not plan to marry in the future.

I have a son(19M) that is currently a highschool senior. My partner has a daughter(21F) who is going to college.

The background you need to understand the issue: when I met my partner I was a widow of 3 years. I am lucky enough to have a very lucrative business and some family money. Also my late husband left a substantial estate, including the house we live in. The house is a family home so it passed to my son as the only heir.
My partner also makes good money and the difference in our lifestyles was pretty much negligible.

But while I and my late husband made sure to not spoil our son (he was responsible for keeping his room clean even though we have a house keeper, he had chores during the weekends, we taught him how to cook, his allowance is reasonable, he has to save for expensive purchases like a car, a PS5...etc). My current partner and his ex-wife spoil their daughter rotten.

Due to an incident when we first moved in together (she demanded my son's bedroom since it was the second biggest, got rejected since it was his home and she only spends the weekend), and after some family therapy we agreed that she will be treated like a guest by me. She will have to follow the house rules and that it the extent of our relationship.

Now while she is spoiled she is a good girl, academically excellent, except for the aforementioned incident very respectful and just a pleasant young woman.

The probelm is that I did not know the extent to which my partner spent money on her. He pays some money as ""rent"" that I put into my son's college fund and we split the common bills in half. Everything else is our own responsibility so we don't know much about each other's finances.

Now my son is planning to do a tour of east Asia during the summer and I was happy to give him the money to do so (as a gift for getting into a very prestigious college). When my stepdaughter heard about it she asked her dad to pay for a tour of Europe since he didn't send her on one after she got into college.

He agreed because he never says no, but he came to me asking me to lend him close to $30k because he can't afford the trip on his own. I am not even giving that much to my son and his plane tickets are more expensive.

I refused. I said that since this wasn't an emergency he can save and send her on the trip after she graduates college. Now he is not talking to me, saying that I am chosing favourites (I have no relationship with his daughter so I don't know how that even is applicable) and that I am putting money over his happiness and relationship with his daughter.

So AITA? I can easily afford to lend him the full amount I just don't want to, because his reasons are not convincing enough.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to help my step sister with her house purchase and telling her and my step father that it's because of how they treated me as a child?
content: I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to let my future husband lie about the house he and I purchased during his 'groom speech'?
content: 
My fiancè (37M) and I (33F) got engaged few months ago. We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.


My fiancè sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's ""just a confidence boost"" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.

He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?

[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to let my sister and her kids move into the house that I bought?
content: I'm a 32 year old woman and I just bought my first house. It has 3 bedrooms, a yard and is just what I need right now. I'm single and have 2 dogs.  My sister is 34, has 3 children and lives in a 2 bedroom apartment. Lately, she's been talking about how  such a tiny living space is not enough for the four of them.

&#x200B;

 When she got to know about the house I had bought, she became very upset and told me I was being ""wasteful"" as I'm single and don't have kids and  therefor don't need such a big space. I reminded her that what I do with my hard earned money is none  of her business. She went on to complain to our mother about how ""selfish"" I was being. Yesterday evening, I got a call from my mom telling me I should let my sister and her kids move into the house. MY house.

&#x200B;

I told her that no one was going to live in the house that I paid for but me, and that extra space would be great for my dogs to play in. My mom also got very upset with me and told me I was being unreasonable.  That my sister's kids are growing and need the space more than my dogs.  I offered to help my sister out financially  so she could rent a bigger place. My mom got my sister on the phone who shot down the idea, telling me I *needed* to let her and her kids live in my house. When I refused again, she very generously suggested a ""compromise"". I could live in the house with her and her kids and would not have to find somewhere else to live. She said this as if she was doing me a favor.

I told her she had lost her mind and hung up. 

Am I the asshole, or is she? I know my sister is struggling financially but this kind of entitlement is ridiculous.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to lie to my mother's husband about how I met my husband?
content: My mother and I have never gotten along. She's very serious, overachiever, type A and I've always clashed with people like that. She is also pretty self righteous about things like pride, and work ethic, and she just isn't my type of person. I feel bad because I'm her only child and I really wish she had a daughter she could actually enjoy.

My mom wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer, because that's what her friends kids were doing, but I rebelled pretty hard against school. I left home the day I turned 18 and got by through modeling, working at clubs with a fake ID, and dating rich men. She always said I would understand her disappointment when I had daughters, but I have two and I cant imagine being ashamed of something so petty.

I met my husband when I was working as a yacht girl. That kind of just means I was paid by rich men to party on their boats and keep the guests entertained. I did date some of those men and they were very generous. My mom views that as prostitution. I don't know if I agree but I 100% think prostitution should be legalized so I don't really care. I met my husband. he scandalized his entire family by marrying one of *those* girls and we've been very happy for eighteen years. I do have an easy life and I'm not going to lie and say it has nothing to do with looks, but they were my looks to do whatever i want with.

My mom doesn't like my husband. She thinks we both partied too much and she was hoping I'd grow up and do something ""respectable"" one day. She hates that he enables me to have the life she didn't want me to have. Well i met her new husband the other day. He works in finance, nice enough guy, but very straitlaced. He asked how i met my husband and I told him, the true story.

My mother was furious and I did know she would want me to lie or leave some details out,but it's my story to tell and I'm not ashamed of my life. My husband thinks I should have lied and said it was full on prostitution, but he's kind of an ass. My mom actually cried after dinner so AITA?",esh

"title: AITA for refusing to pay for girl’s wig after she shaved it because of me?
content: There’s this girl that lives in my uni halls, we’re not roommates but we are flatmates. Let’s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We’re not best friends but we are friendly. We don’t really spend much time together.  


Over time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn’t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don’t owe the style and she’s free to wear what she likes but it’s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.


But then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I’d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. 
I joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. 
Basically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It’s just really creepy but I haven’t said anything, I wouldn’t even know what to say.

Over the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.

I deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it’s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.
She kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it’s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she’s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to sell my horse?
content: Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. 

I’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.

When I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. 

At first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.

Then last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. 

So I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?

Edit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I’m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️

"title: AITA for refusing to share a room with a 1yr old, twin 2yr olds and a 4yr old?
content: So I F(18) was recently invited up to my aunt and uncle’s (I’ll call them aunt and uncle B) ranch house for the 4th of July, and told I could bring a friend. Now, this aunt and uncle have a pretty big house. Their ranch house has four bedrooms with queen beds, the master bedroom, and the “kids room” which is a massive room with about ~6 beds (some bunked), and a loft. They’ve got a lot of land around the house too, so I was excited to get some time to goof off and run around with my friend (also F18). I know that other cousins are going to be there, and assume that my aunt B and uncle B thought beds through and everything like that.

The other people invited up to the house were Aunt G and Uncle G and their son M16 who I’ll call F, my Uncle P, and my Aunt and Uncle H.

H’s are baby cannons. They have four kids under the age of 5, none of whom sleep through the night (I’ve been to their house before, it’s horrible). 

Anyway, my friend and I get up to the house and learn that WE are expected to share the big bunk room with the kids under five, while their parents get their own room. Uncle P, cousin F, and Aunt and Uncle G, are also in their own rooms (G’s shared one).

I was upset. But, wanting to stay up there, I said okay, my friend and I can sleep on the couch.

Cue a MASSIVE explosion.

The baby cannons are pissed that I don’t want to sleep in the same room as their children. Their kids are horrible at night, and someone needs to watch them, so it should be me and my friend because I got to invite a friend. I said that if they wanted someone to, cousin F could, but cousin F apparently needed his sleep because he’s a “growing boy” and he “doesn’t know how to take care of kids”.

None of the other people in the house wanted to get involved. The aunt and uncle who own the house didn’t care much and just told us to figure it out. So I ignore the baby cannons and set up on the couch with my friend.

Cue the baby cannons mother. She throws all of our stuff off of the couches and tells me and my friend that we HAVE to sleep with her kids or we can’t stay. At this point, I’m mortified by her behavior because I have a friend. My friend is embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do.

So I tell them I’m leaving.
Cue more screaming.
I drove up my father’s boat, if I leave, there’s nobody with a truck to drive the boat around, the world is ending.

I say that either my friend and I are sleeping on the couch, without the small children, or we’re leaving.

Well, baby cannons weren’t okay with that. So, I packed up my stuff, reattached the trailer for the boat, and left.

Now I’m getting texts from relatives that I was rude and could have handled it better, and that the baby cannons need a break from their kids and I’m young so I can be a nice family member and deal with it for them. 

AITA here?

UPDATE 7/1; My father has banned the baby cannon from ever going on the boat again. Aunt B is getting involved and is considering asking the baby cannon family to leave for the weekend and to not come back until they can be more considerate of relatives. Uncle B is offering to pay for me and my friend to go on a backpacking trip (my friend and I go a lot), and says that he feels bad for how the baby cannons acted.",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to split my inheritance with my siblings?
content: I’ll try to summarize as much as possible. 

I (f19) have an estranged grandpa more or less. He’s my dad’s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. I have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). My grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn’t see him. 

When he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. He’d stay for a week at a time and then go home. He was an old, bitter man to be honest. He never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he’d had his whole life. 

He wasn’t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone I’ve ever met. But regardless of this, he was filthy rich. He owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. He retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. So it sold for well over $3m. 

I was never close with my grandpa, but I took after his sister who is an RN and he adores her. He always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. 

He died a few months ago. Since then, my family has been torn apart. He left everything to me. He essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. I was shocked. I didn’t and still don’t know what to do with the money, but I’m going to save it. 

My dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. I just can’t do it. 

My dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. Despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. My dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. 

As far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he’s very wasteful and ungrateful. He never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. 

My little sister is the only person I’ve actually considered. She’s very young and that’s really the only thing stopping me. Her mom is money oriented and would take the money from her. So I’m waiting until she turns 18 and i offered to pay for her college. 

But now my family is telling me I’m unfair and the money doesn’t belong to me and I’m not deserving of it. That I’m too young and I’ll waste it on cars and clothes. 

I don’t agree and now they’re all threatening to cut me off and never speak to me, or even sue me if I don’t give them all a chunk of the money. I don’t know what to do and I’m buckling under pressure here. I’ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming I stole the money from him. Everything was through an attorney, I know I did nothing wrong legally.. but morally? Idk. So AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for refusing to watch my sister's stepkid and exposing her lies to her husband?
content: 

My f/21 sister Jess, f/30, is married and has a 5 yo stepson. her husband works full time and she is a sahm.


Every monday, she'd call my mom at 9am to get her to go over to her house and watch her stepkid for few hours, I live at home with my parents and so I've noticed this routine for weeks now.

Last week mom went out of town to visit some relatives, and yesterday (monday) at 9am my sister called asking me to come watch her stepkid for few hours because she had an important thing to do. I said no because I had to go study and also she does this every monday so clearly it wasn't important or urgent but she insisted it was, I told her sorry but no. She ended the call then I went to the university.


Hours later, I got a call from my brother in law asking where my sister was, I said I had no idea. he proceeded to tell me he just came home at 1pm and found his son by himself at the house. I was in shock that my sister left her stepkid by himself so she could go God knows where. I told him about the conversation I had with her and he got angry.

In the evening my sister came over and started making a scene by yelling at me for bailing on her after she sent me a text message telling me she was already out the house to force me to come watch her stepson. I didn't see the fb message til she told me but she said I did this deliberately and also, exposed her to her husband because she told him she'd be at home with the kid. Not just that, but I also told her husband that mom comes over every monday morning to watch the kid for few hours which caused a huge fight between him and my sister. She yelled that I was petty and selfish and just stirred shit and caused issues in her marriage by tattling to her husband. I couldn't keep arguing I went into my room and started playing music. My dad and the others said I was to blame for not helping my sister and now being the reason she and her husband are in conflict.


AITA?

Okay guys so I saw few questions asked multiple times so I'll just put the answers out here for all to see.

1) My brother in law's wife is deceased.

2) brother in law is always at work when my sister calls my mom to get her to come over and watch her stepson.

3) most of you guys are asking where my sister goes every monday, and I even saw someone mention that I was YTA for not finding out, but I don't know anything, I have no idea what's going with my sister and I thought it was non of my business.


UPDATE: Guys! I've decided to try and find out what is really going with Jess. I'm not the type to snoop and it's not my business but she already made it my business by turning the family against me because of something she did. Ngl I came here thinking I was going to get toast but I wrong, thank goodness for that. I'll update as soon as possible. Thanks :)",nta
"title: AITA for rejecting the role of ""cool aunt"" because it was really more like unpaid babysitter?
content: My sister and I have always been very different. Growing up, she was your stereotypical nerdy/geeky girl. Very into sci-fi/fantasy, video games, etc. She bonded a lot with my parents over it, because they are the same.

I always felt kind of ""different"" from the others because I'm not very ""geeky"" and while I did my best to fit in (Star Wars movies, Harry Potter, etc), I took my first opportunity to leave the area for school. I went to FIT and got a degree in fashion design.  I always loved making my own clothes. To frame it one way... I made my prom dress from my own pattern, and my family smiled politely. My sister threw together a Harry Potter costume and the picture is hanging on the walls.

Well, sis had kids a while back. I sent polite gifts, including a quilt to be handed down. Sis received them warmly, but I found out she doesn't use the quilt because the room is ""Harry Potter"" themed.

Due to COVID, I ended up moving back closer to home into a condo I'd been renting out (tenants were not evicted or anything). Once Sis found out, she got really excited and started making all kinds of plans. I was thrilled because I thought *she* wanted to spend more time with me.

Except the plans were like... I take the kids to the zoo, I take them to the park, I take them for ice cream, the aquarium, etc, so Sis can have some time to herself and relax, play video games, etc. I inquired about when she and I would spend time together, and she actually said ""It's not like we have anything in common we can do together.""

I was really hurt by this, and declined her requests for me to basically babysit her kids. She asked me why, and didn't I want to be the Cool Aunt, and this is where I think I'm the asshole.

I said ""I don't know, it's not like I have anything in common with them that we can do together. Sounds like you want an unpaid babysitter.""

She was shocked and went stomping to Mom and Dad, who immediately took her side and told me that I should be thankful to spend time with the kids. I said why, it's not like anyone in the family has *ever* made it a point to spend time with me doing something *I'd* enjoy. She told me that if I'd tried harder to be more like there rest of them, instead of ""chasing popularity and doing my nails"" maybe I would have more in common with them.

I'm lost now, because on the one hand, I don't think I was wrong to decline being a free sitter for my sister. But maybe my Mom is right and I've been a shitty member of the family because I couldn't just get into Star Wars and all that.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to chime in and say that Star Wars & Harry Potter aren't the only geeky/nerdy things they like, they were just the things that popped into my head. I remember back when we were in high school, my sister laughed in my face because I didn't enjoy the Sabriel books and she told me they were ""too advanced"" for me to understand. She found me reading the California Diaries (offshoot of Babysitters Club books) and laughed in my face again because they were ""dumb books for vapid little girls.""

**EDIT 2:** One thing I'm curious about is why so many people are telling me, first thing, in their comments, that they're geeky/nerdy! Why do you think that makes things different? ",nta
"title: AITA for removing the bedroom lock after my husband ignored a family emergency?
content: Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. 

He values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP"" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.


This past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.


I could be wrong for what I've done but I was frustrated and mad. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for replying to a coworkers inappropriate texts by work email, and attaching them?
content: 
One of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. 

Asking me to come over and ""have some fun"" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)

He also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. 

When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like ""What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem"". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... 

And I included dealing with this fucker as a ""workday problem"" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. 

On Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:

 ""Hi 'Coworker'

I'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)

Please only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.

Additionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. 

- OP""

I didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. 

And he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? 

I screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying ""As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack."" 

He stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked ""Is this a work question?"" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? 

He walked off... 

I feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.

AITA for sending that email?

---

Edit... 

Looks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. 

I'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.

Edit 2... 

 I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. 

It's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? 

I do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.

Edit 3...

Holy shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. 

She just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. 

I asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.

I haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.

Edit 4...

He was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. 

I owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",nta
"title: AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?
content: My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed.

My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled ""I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???"" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was ""royalty"" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I ""technically"" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

"title: AITA for revealing our net worth when my wife constantly says we are broke and making me look bad with money?
content: I (31M) have been with my wife (30F) for 10 years now and she always has had this habit of making me look bad with our finances. Whenever anything regarding spending money comes up she will always say how broke we are and she doesn't have the money to do this or buy that. The thing is we are doing well financially. We have decent jobs and combine our salary is roughly $125k/yr.

As of today our net worth is more than $1 million but less than 2. I had saved/invested a lot before getting married so I gave us a good head start. I control the finances/take the lead but we both agreed to living a very modest life. We both have our cars from college for example (Honda & Toyota). She knows everything about our finances because at least once a month I go over it with her every time I deposit money in our investment accounts or our kids college funds. For banking we have an emergency fund and I budget everything else to go straight into investments. We basically stay right at $10k in our banks savings account and $500 in our checking account after bills. EDIT: Most of the time there is more than $500 in our checkings but once I pay our CC each month I then move anything extra. We always use the CC so its not like we only have $500 to spend. Our CC limit is $25,000.

A few months ago we had dinner with her friends and they talked buying a new car. My wife said something like, 'I wish I could get a new car but I'm always broke after paying the bills. We still have our college cars!' (EDIT: Wife does not want a new car). She will go on to talk about if she had money what she would want to buy and it always makes me feel ashamed. This 'I'm broke story' has been happening for years. When we were driving home I asked her about. She understood we have the money but its how she feels because her bank account is always low. I said I can increase our budget or keep more money in our bank if she wants. Since we are doing well I'm okay with spending more. She said no and again was happy with our finances. I explained that when she says we are broke it makes me look bad and I feel ashamed. Its as though I can't provide for the family and/or I am bad with money. She doesn't see it that way. 

The same conversation has come up numerous times about us being broke. Recently, I reminded her numerous tikes it makes me feel and look bad infront of friends and family. I told her if she keeps saying stuff like that I will reveal that we are doing well with money. I gave her a few reminders I'd eventually do this but she kept going with the I'm broke story.

At a dinner with her sister and parents the same I'm broke story came up. I piped in and said, 'It's weird to hear a millionaire say they are broke.' My wife said, 'Haha, I'm not though.' And I quickly say, 'We are millionaires and you know that. We go over our finances every month.' Well the I'm broke story stopped after that and the night went on as usual. A little later the same thing happens with her friends and I use the same line. 

Now my wife is mad at me for using that line and revealing roughly how much money we have. She said it seems like I'm gloating. I say its better than making me look like I'm running us into the ground fincially. So AITA for revealing our networth when my wife says we are broke?

EDIT: Final update for now as we have a long weekend planned. Some key points I saw a lot of and wanted to give answers.

-I'm pretty open to us spending money and I don't restrict her spending. She has the CC to spend money monthly. Most of the month we have far more than $500 in our checking but I move anything above to our investments once I pay the CC every month. I know I won't have any big expenses then. If I do we have the CC limit and the $10k emergency cash.

-We live on a really cheap area and had a low cost of living. We never felt rhe need to upgrade ungrade until we wanted to start having kids. I didn't have to change our lifestyle much to save a lot. 

-My job is in demand and pays well because nobody wants to live out in my area. So after expenses I take home a lot more than I would living in a major city. Probably 3 to 4 times more net savings annually if I had to guess.

-She doesn't want a new car and has told me that multiple times. She doesn't like driving and feels comfortable with her current car. 

-She doesn't know what she wants to do when she retires. I know I'll be golfing, games, and eating edibles most days. I don't do any of this much now because we have kids and they will be my focus for a long time. I maybe golf 1 or 2 times a month amd thats the only times I take edibles.

-I'll speak more with my wife about this. After reading posts I think she may not feel like its her money since she never saved much before we got engaged.",nta

I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents.

"title: AITA for ruining game night by telling the truth?
content: A few nights ago, I hosted a game night for a small group of friends (we had all been quarantining and following the proper guidelines in my county). It was only going to be 5 of us (including me), but one of my friends texted me last minute that she was going to bring a coworker from work (Matt-fake name). Fine with me.

We started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (Level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). Everyone was enjoying themselves, and I was happy with the way things were going.

Cue a question I drew: ""What's the hardest thing you've ever had to go through?""

Some backstory: My sister passed away a few years ago when I was still in high school. I was pulled out of class and flew immediately to her college and watched her die in the ICU. Needless to say, this is probably the hardest thing I've been through. 3 of my friends in the group knew about this, the other 2 and Matt did not.

I didn't want to bring the mood down, so I answered that the hardest thing I'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where I knew no one. We were all ready to move on, but Matt immediately piped up and said, ""Wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life."" 

Everyone got quiet. Now, if he had said it jokingly, I probably would have let it go and moved on. However, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and I will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. Instead of letting it go, I said ""well, the hardest thing I've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the ICU and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when I was 17. I just didn't want to bring the mood down.""

If things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. Matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. After my friends all left, my friend who had brought Matt texted me and told me I was a jerk for making Matt look bad, and I could have just let his statement go. I do feel bad about what I said and being the cause of game night ending so soon, but I also feel like I was just making a justified statement. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for saying I won’t coddle my infertile sister any more?
content: My sister “Julie” has tried to have a baby for 5 years. She had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. My heart hurts for her. However, one thing I don’t agree with is how my family has handled it. We’re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can’t come to family events that she’ll attend. She won’t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. 

I got pregnant last year. I told Julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. I said I understood. The first hurdle came with my baby shower. My MIL was throwing it. I didn’t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn’t have one period, “out of respect”. I said that was ridiculous. She didn’t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.

When my son was born, I posted a birth announcement on Facebook. My parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt Julie. I said she could just block or mute me. They said I should make the effort. Julie echoed that if I cared, I’d stop. I ended up blocking her just to save drama. 

My aunt’s 70th birthday party is next week. My husband and I planned to go, bringing our son. Julie called and asked if we were going. She then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. I said no. She doesn’t want to miss the party. My aunt is one of the few people who agree that Julie’s boundaries aren’t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn’t get to see him often. Julie got upset and started crying, saying that I was unfair. 

I finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? Would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she’s refused to give other people’s kids? Will her baby be allowed to attend events? She said that was different. I said no, I’m not coddling her anymore. My son exists, he’s family and he’s coming. She can decide if she wants to or not.

My parents yelled at me for being mean to Julie. They offered to pay for a sitter but I said no. It’s not even her house. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for saying no to picking up my sons half sister from school?
content: I am a single mom of two boys ages 11 and 10. Their father and I divorced 5 years ago after I learned he was cheating on me. He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay ""friends"" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.

He married his affair partner. They had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. Last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.

What followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.

What I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.

But I guess part of me does feel bad for the child. My son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and I hate that for them.

"title: AITA for saying that my kids are not my “greatest accomplishment” and that I resent the assumption they are?
content: I love my kids, but they are not my everything. I had a whole lifetime before. I ran marathons, climbed mountains, wrote a novel that was published and did moderately successful in the 00s, and have a MFA in creative writing.

Chatting with some folks in the neighborhood, we got to talking about our greatest accomplishments. When it came to me, Tom said “Oh, well we know what your greatest accomplishment is, obviously. You have three beautiful, well-behaved children.”

I was honestly shocked, and I said no, that’s NOT my greatest accomplishment. He looked just as shocked, and I said what my greatest accomplishment is, and then said “And by the way, I resent the assumption that having kids is my greatest accomplishment. You have kids, why didn’t you say that?”

He said how he didn’t *birth* the kids, and how that’s a miracle of life and all that gag-me shit. I just rolled my eyes and said “Let’s not boil women down to their biological functions, kay?”

Jen, who has kids, chimed in and said “Well, my kids are my greatest accomplishment. I can’t imagine thinking anything else.”

Tom looked super smug, others including other moms chimed in. All of the moms agreed their kids were their greatest accomplishment.

I kind of stewed about it. After that, the woman who chimed in sent me a message asking me if I needed to talk to someone, and asked if I was depressed, because my statement was worrisome. She ended up reaching out to my husband to encourage me to get help, because it seems I’m unhappy being a mom and that puts my kids at risk.

Am I really the asshole here for thinking being a Mom isn’t the end all be all of my life? Like… wtf?

**Edit:** Why are people sending me chats instead of posting? Don't send me chats. I'm just going to ignore them. And no, AskGoblins, I don't want you to read my post on your shitty YouTube channel.

Also, Lucia-pacciola, who crossposted this to ""AmITheAngel"", my greatest accomplishment is actually climbing Kili and Denali the same summer I knocked off the final 14ers of the contiguous US states, with my now husband. But go off with thinking it's bad to be proud of having a MFA.",nta
"title: AITA for screenshotting messages guys sent me and sending them to their mothers?
content: I'm an 18 year old girl who is in college atm. I've been getting bullied/harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and nsfw pictures that i'm sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail. I should have reported them or just blocked them but I had, had enough so I screenshot every message they'd sent me and found their mothers through their facebook pages and sent screenshots to them including an explanation of who I am and how their sons have been bothering me.

Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side. Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their Mothers and also how I don't know what their home life is like. 

Am I the asshole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?

Edit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.

Edit 2: also whoever reported me as worried about my current mental health...thanks? I mean i'm honestly good but thanks.",nta
"title: AITA for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?
content: My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. She's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! I'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.

**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",nta
"title: AITA for setting a glitter trap to catch my mother in law trying to snoop?
content: For some weird reason my MIL really wants to go into our bedroom whenever she comes over.  On one occasion I followed her as she went upstairs (i was going to get something for my child as the bedrooms are upstairs) and she walked past the bathroom on the main floor and up the stairs behind it.  She didn’t hear me and I caught her walking straight into my room and rifling through bills on my dresser.  She denied snooping (even though I’d just watched her do it) and said she was just going to use our bathroom because she couldn’t find the other ones. She walked right past the one on the main floor and another one in the upstairs hallway to go into our bedroom. Since that happened, I installed an exterior doorknob that requires a key on our bedroom door and one on the door to our office/spare bedroom. 

However, she’s still always “forgetting” where the bathroom is and trying the bedroom and office door.  This really ticks me off.  My husband says that I just get annoyed at this because everything she does drives me crazy and since we’ve put locks on the rooms we don’t want her in, there isn’t really a problem anymore.  

Well over the holidays we had my in laws over for dinner and before they came I was searching for the bedroom keys. We hadn’t used them in a while since we only lock the doors when MIL comes over.  My husband told me we didn’t need to lock the doors since she wouldn’t try to get into the rooms and I insisted that she would because she loves to snoop.  We went back and forth and decided to cover the doorknobs in super fine glitter to see if she tried them.  

I did this once before when husband didn’t believe me about the snooping to prove she’d been in the rooms.  Last time she ignored the glitter and we didn’t say anything about it but then my husband couldn’t deny that she’d tried to snoop.  So this time I covered the knobs in glitter and for the office went a touch further and rigged a little folder of glitter over the door to the office before the in laws came over.  I left it one side unlocked (French doors) and it was set so if you walked in the room you would get covered in glitter. 

Husband goes out of his way to show his mom the main floor bathroom when they got here and specifically asks his parents and sister not to go upstairs.  There’s a  baby gate so the kids can’t get upstairs either. 

Well guess who had to go to the bathroom and got covered in glitter and had it all over their hands and hair?  She completely lost it and started screaming at me so I yelled back and now my husband is saying I went too far and I’m the asshole.  MIL also says I’m the asshole but SIL says I didn’t do anything wrong and MIL deserved it for snooping.  FIL is Switzerland.  Apparently her car is ruined now too because it’s covered in glitter that she cant get cleaned up. So AITA?

ETA: I can’t believe this blew up and I wanted to say thank you for all the support and the awards!  My husband woke up and found this post and I think the comments have been an eye opener.  We are going to start couple’s therapy in January so I think that will be great for us.  

I will be ordering some cellulose glitter that is biodegradable and safer for future projects.  

And if she comes over again I will set up a camera haha or at least print out some fun fake documents so if she snoops again she can at least find something interesting :)",nta
"title: AITA for shouting at my ex in front of my daughters?
content: I (37M) have three girls; 8, 10, and 12. Their mother walked out on us for another man when our youngest was around 4. My ex still stays in contact, though, and pays child support.

A few weeks ago while doing laundry, I saw red spots on my oldest's underwear. I asked her if she knew about it, and she cried and told me she tried to call her mom, but my ex didn't call back. She'd been stuffing toilet paper in her underwear, hoping that would work. I explained to her that periods are nothing to be ashamed of, and found some great resources online for us to review together. I took her to the store to pick out brands of feminine products she wanted to use (she picked Playtex Sport because she's a gymnast). 

After we were done, I decided I should do the same thing with my other two. My 12yo volunteered to be part of preparing them, and we made a whole night of it; it was wonderful, and I learned a lot. I even learned what a menstrual cup is, and how they benefit the environment.

The other day, my ex called back. I'll usually arrange a video chat and leave the room so they can have some alone time, and when they're done chatting, I'll come back in to talk boring co-parenting stuff like school, bills, etc. This last time, my ex was FURIOUS with me for talking about periods with the girls. She shouted at me that I was sick and perverted, why didn't I call her myself if I knew it was so urgent, I could've called one of their grandmas/aunts, but my mom has dementia, while her mom and sisters call me a loser because I teach kindergarten, so I'm not fond of them.

My ex told me I was being immature and should have just toughed it out for the girls. This really pissed me off, so I shouted back that maybe if she wasn't such a deadbeat and answered her goddamned phone once in a while, she could have handled this. I brought up everything she does that hurts them; she hasn't been to a single soccer game, piano recital, or gymnastics meet in two years, every other weekend when they come home from her house, they go straight to their rooms, only to emerge hours later asking me why she loves her new husband more than them, and what did they do to make her leave. My ex responded by saying I should tell them it's not their fault I couldn't satisfy her, and I screamed ""fuck you"", and she just smirked and pointed behind me, saying ""Look what you did""

When I turned around, my 8yo and 10yo were standing in the doorway crying. It broke my heart; I never shout, so I know I scared them. My 12yo stormed in and started screaming at her mom, and while I appreciate her sticking up for me, this is not a battle I want her fighting. My ex hung up before I could fully deescalate the situation, and let's just say the girls have been given free reign of the ice cream and limitless hours of video games, because I feel so bad. I even watched all the Twilight movies with them, so don't say I don't love them. But in this instance, AITA for shouting?",nta
"title: AITA for showing my boyfriend my used sanitary towel in an argument?
content: Title sounds gross I know, maybe it is a bit gross.

Background: me (F23) and boyfriend (m22) have been together for 6 months, good relationship, healthy sex life that we talk about a lot and communicate our needs etc. A month ago I had the implant fitted (contreception) which has given me weird frequent periods. The doctor told me they should go back to normal in a few months and to wait it out, which I'm doing because I like the convenience of the implant. English isn't my first language so sorry for any bad writing.

We were in bed yesterday night watching TV and he went to initiate sex. I moved his hand away and said I was still on my period. My period had been going for about a week now so we'd not had sex in that time. Then my boyfriend made a really loud dramatic sigh and moved away from me. I said 'sorry, I can't help my periods.'

He replied 'yeah sure.' I said what was that suppose to mean? He wouldn't give me a straight answer and kept saying 'whatever'.

We didn't talk for a while and kept watching TV in silence. Then he said 'if you don't want to have sex you can just say you know.'

I was kind of pissed off at this because I felt like he was saying I was faking being on my period. I told him I really was still on my period. He said no periods last longer than a week, and I told him that the doctor had said this was normal for some people on the implant at first and it will settle.

He told me that he didn't believe me and so I called him an idiot (which wasn't nice I know). He then started ranting that how could I call him an idiot when I was clearly a liar who must be cheating on him and getting sex elsewhere which is why I am lying about my periods. I couldn't believe he was saying this because he's never freaked out on me like this. Cheating has also never ever been mentioned in our relationship ever so I don't know where this came from. It annoyed me so much that I got out of bed and pulled my trousers and pants down so he could see my sanitary towel that was bloody and shouted Could I fake this??

He screamed that I was fucking disgusting and left the room. I started laughing because of the ridiculous of the situation and that pissed him off more, as he grabbed his keys and stormed out of the house.

I tried to text him but he ignored me, so I left him to it as I was pretty annoyed by his behaviour. I then got a text a few hours later around 11pm from his sister saying he had gone to his mom and dad's house and told his sister what happened. She said what I had done was really disgusting and he's refusing to come back unless I apologise. I told my friend what happened and she said he was being an idiot but that I also needed to apologise because what I did was 'abhorrent'.

I'm annoyed with what he did but also think it was pretty gross of me to do that. I don't really know why I did it it was just a spur of the moment thing. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Just wanted to offer an update. This has really changed my perspective on things. I think I was so thinking about the sanitary towel thing that I hadn't really realised how bad his behaviour was. 

His mom actually sent me a message on facebook saying what I did was disgusting and really abnormal and that she doesn't think me and my boyfriend should date anymore. I can't believe his mom is messaging me about this. I blocked her and messaged him that he needs to come and pick up his stuff that he's left at mine. Luckily it isn't much. He hasn't replied but I saw that he has shared a post on facebook about women being crazy. So I guess we're done.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. And sorry to everyone else who is dealing with annoying periods due to controception! It sucks!",nta
"title: AITA for showing my husband the text his mom sent me and causing her to be disowned?
content: To start me and my mother in law have never gotten along. She hates my guts and can be oversensitive often times. I tried not to give her the wrong impression about me but we just don't like each other.

Sunday, I was feeling sick (I'm a new mom btw) and couldn't eat what she cooked for dinner and she seemeed to take it personal. She sent me a private message of what seemed to be her final straw with my behavior and it stated the following: copy/paste

""Oh yes I know and feel your passive aggressive vibe. You keep pretending to be sick so you won't have to eat what I cook? What? You think my cooking is disgusting? You think I'm unhigynec? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU ACTUALLY LOOKED AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR? Apologies I forgot you're a new mom and can't be bothered to even get your hair brushed. You finally trapped our son and now want to use the baby as a pawn.I don’t like the fact you're my grandchild's mother. I don’t think I'll ever come to terms with it because you bore him. But I’ll pretend. Pretend I don’t know my son's been having chats with his ex every chance he gets. Be mean to his mommy. Me. And you’ll see how far that gets you. Oh and when I watch your shitbeast dog it stays chained to a garage day and night until a half hour before you arrive. It stinks up my house you know same with your hair and clothes"". My mind was blown and my gut reaction was to immediately go to my husband and show him what his mom sent and he didn't take it well. He tried calling her but she didn't respond. It was 11pm and he decided to drive to his parents house and pick a fight with her about the text. According to my sister in law #1 who witnessed it he yelled at his mother and berated her and caller her names then disowned her which shocked everyone in the house. My mother in law is diabetic she fainted on the spot and my husband didn't stop he just walked out of there while his family were yelling at him. I got several calls and texts from them claiming I just caused irreparable damage in my husband's relationship with his mother, jeopardized her health because she was taken to the hospital and worsthe of all making my husband disown her over what? A dinner that i could've gotten a few bites of? A simple misunderstanding? They accused me of causing this shitshow and turning my husband on his own mother and disowning her like that. Sister in law #3 berated me for sharing the text with my husband saying I should've confronted my mother in law alone instead of escalating the situation. She said I'm responsible for whatever happens next and have to fix the problem I created.

I feel awful overall and so guilty since she's at the hospital and the family are feeling tense. My husband is avoiding me.AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for shutting down talk about having kids with “purposely controversial statements?”
content:    
Our region has done well handling COVID, so my husband and I had a small group of family over for a backyard BBQ a month ago.

We’re the only ones in the family “left” who don’t have kids. We’re not going to. We prefer our lives as mountaineers. His family thinks we'll change our minds. Mind you, husband had the snip.

MIL jokingly mentioned that maybe with all the “alone time” we’d be giving the family a little bundle of joy. We shut the idea down with good humor. She kept pressing, and SIL chimed in with “Come on, this is the perfect time to get started!”

Husband: We’ve talked about this already. Let’s drop it.

MIL: Well, I don’t care. 

Husband: Again, drop it.

MIL: I hope it happens!

Husband: Thankfully we’re very careful.

MIL: Accidents happen. It isn’t always up to you.

Husband: Yes, it is. I had a vasectomy. Like I said, discussion over. Can we move on?

We do, but MIL and SIL are whispering with each other and shooting glances, looking at their phones, etc. BIL and I are laughing about something dumb on TV, seems like everything is fine.

Until SIL says, “Vasectomies can fail, you know! It’s not a 100% thing.”

It gets quiet, MIL & SIL look smug.

MIL: So there’s still a chance you can get pregnant, you can NEVER be sure!

Husband & I lock eyes. Party’s over.

Me: That is exactly what abortions are for.

Cue screaming and yelling, I’m an evil, cruel bitch, what kind of monster, etc. His family are all supposedly pro-choice.

Husband yells at them to GTFO, don’t talk to me like that. MIL gets up in his face and yells that I said I would kill her grandbabies, how could he stand to hear it.

Husband: And I would hold her fucking hand the entire time because it’s what BOTH of us would want.

Party’s over. Cue FB shitstorm. MIL’s post tags us, says: “We were having a nice family get together and OP and Husband had bait us with purposely controversial statements. Every mom lives to see her babies have babies. Yesterday I was told that my cruel DIL would murder my grandbabies if she got pregnant and my son would hold her hand while she did it.”

I do not feel like we’re assholes, even for how we handled the situation. There was no getting through to them without being direct and final. This isn’t the first time we tried to get them to drop the subject. However, other family members really think we are in the wrong and that I went over the line.

"title: AITA for still going to my dental appointment after my husband tried to get me to reschedule?
content: 

So I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.

My husband's (m37) best friend ""Terry"" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically ""tell on me"" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.

Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.

He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.

Instead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.

content: I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.

My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it. 

Her wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said ""where's Nia's dress?"". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said ""fine"" and that was it.

At the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card ""Nia"".

I continued to get messages from strangers telling me how awful a person I was and how they hoped I died through various means.

So I sued my ex.

It ruined them. I knew they were financially in a bad spot and they likely couldn't afford court fees but the case dragged.

They made a video about not being able to afford court costs and such and how it was going to ruin them.

After which a bunch of friends started telling me to just let it go and move on but I had sunk money into the case as well. It wasn't cheap for me either so I didn't just let it go.

Eventually the judge ruled in my favor and I received a total of nothing from my ex......

But it meant I could link to the result in the comments section of every video she tried to frame me as the bad guy because in our state, court proceedings are public record.

Suddenly her viewership dropped and she blamed me for ruining her life.

A bunch of my friends said I went too far and should've just taken the court win and left her alone.

Was I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for supporting my wife after my daughter publicly exposed her diary which had ""cruel"" comments?
content: I have been remarried for a year now to my wife. I have a 15 year old daughter and a 11 year old son from my first marriage. I also have a 15 year old stepdaughter.

My wife has always gotten along with my children very well and has gone above and beyond to integrate our families.

And although at first my daughter was very standoffish to my wife, my wife was eventually able to bond with her. Only then did we get married.

A few weeks ago, my daughter found my wife's diary that she had been writing to when we went to marital counseling before we got married. Both our first marriages were terrible so we were determined to do it right. I also was given a diary.

My daughter then proceeded to read everything and even take photographs of certain pages. She then posted the photographs on Facebook and called my wife a bunch of cruel names.

My wife had written a few things about how she wished I didn't have kids before we met so we could have had less issues dealing with my ex.

She also said how she hated that my daughter had picked up so many bad traits from my ex.

And the last thing related to my kids was that she said my ex was a terrible mother for weaponizing her kids.

I admit I was taken aback and upset that my wife had written these things because I knew my kids would be hurt.

But this was also a personal diary as part of a therapy exercise and the diary had been hidden in our closet.

My daughter even posted some very sensitive information about my wife dealing with her father who was an alcoholic.

My wife is inconsolable. A lot of my family and friends have turned on my wife because they think what she wrote was terrible.

I disagree. She wrote things that she was concerned would affect our marriage and the counseling actually helped us deal with having stepchildren. And it's not like I shared the same opinion about my ex.

I'm just so defeated. My daughter will no longer see me if my wife is around and won't step foot in our house. My son is following her lead. My wife has already apologized several times.

My ex has said she will be starting the process to reduce my custody and sue for defamation. I know she won't win the defamation case but I feel like custody will indeed switch. I'm very stressed out.

My daughter refused to take down the diary pages and insists she's in the right.

I have taken my wife's side in all this. Am I the asshole? My entire family has been blown up.",nta
"title: AITA for telling a social worker the real reason my sister wants a foster kid?
content: So this is a throw away account. While my sister doesn't use reddit, we have mutual friends who do.

I'm a 28F and I have a sister (36F) For the sake of story, I'll just call Jane. Jane is married to ""Bob"" and they have two kids, boy and a girl. My niece and nephew are wonderful kids and no trouble at all. They fight as siblings do but nothing big. I love them. Now for about two years, I did live with my sister. It was a miserable time that really effected our relationship. She saw me as free labor, money and babysitting. Even when I managed to get a small part time job, she demanded I hand over nearly half my pay or get out. It was hell as she took completely advantage of me. I moved out as soon as I could and we have little contact outside of family gatherings.

Now after I moved out, she started complaining how ""She has no help with the kids and never gets a break!"" I babysit sometimes but I have made it clear, just cause I am off work, doesn't mean I want an 8 hour day with my niece and nephew.

Anyway she started talking about how she wanted to foster a kid. Not a kid but a teenager. I pressed her for more info on this. She wants to adopt a teenager so she has a live in babysitter for her kids. This is her logic: ""I want a kid around 16 or 17, you know someone who may have been in the system for awhile. They can share a room with your nephew (she only has a three 3 bedroom house) or sleep in the garage. They can help me with house work, chores, cook and help me with my business.(She bakes and sells cookies) Also babysit the kids so me and Bob can go out sometimes or have some alone time. They'll be so grateful for a home and won't complain. I won't have to pay them at all. And then when they turn 18, I can just sign up for another foster kid! A teenager will be so much easier than a little kid, they will be grateful just to have a roof, food, siblings if they have been separated from their real ones and clothes.""

I was horrified! Told her it was a horrible idea! She didn't listen to me. She went on with it anyway. About a month ago, a social worker showed up at my apartment to ask me some questions about my sister. She had put me down as a character witness or something like that. I immediately told the social worker why my sister really wanted to foster a kid and how she treated me when I lived with her. The lady thanked me.

My sister called crying saying that she wouldn't be considered for any adoptions or fosters. The social worker told her that they felt her home and her weren't a good fit. She asked if I said anything and I told the truth. She went off on me, hung up and we haven't spoken since. She has sent some angry texts. A couple family members are on her side. They think foster kids are fucking dogs or something and would be so happy just to have a roof and would gladly do all the housework.

So AITA here?

Edit: So wow! I didn't know my post blew up like this till I got home from work! Thank you everyone for the kind words, messages and awards.  Remember no child is in control of the circumstances that may have landed them in the foster care system.  They are children and still human. They deserve a loving home and care.  Do right by a foster kid. And thank you again.  Feel free to message me or chat if you like. ",nta
"title: AITA for telling a woman who lives in my complex that yes having her husband check me out turns me on?
content: Okay, hear me out. I live in a complex that is built in a circle so its like a track. A lot of people use it to run, walk, etc. I've always used it to run/walk as well. I live in Florida so I usually wear leggings and a sports bra or a tank top. I literally only wear it because it's insanely hot here.

This woman always gave me dirty looks when I'd walk by her apartment (she'd be sitting on her porch.) There are a few maintenance guys (not sure if that is the correct title for them - but that is what everyone calls them) that walk and ride around on golf carts throughout the day. I soon realized that the dirty look woman is married to one of the maintenance workers. I am always polite to them, but have never talked to them by any means.

So, yesterday I was working out on the tennis court which is near their apartment. Her and her husband were sitting on the porch. She is giving me the dirtiest looks and is making me pretty uncomfortable but I try to ignore it. Before I leave she says, ""Do you like get off on having the maintenance men check you out all day?"" To which I replied, ""Actually yes it makes me super wet. They are what keeps my sex drive high."" She looked shocked and her husband started laughing and then she smacked him on the arm. 

I came back and told my mom this story and she said I should be more sensitive and obviously the woman is insecure. Now I kinda feel bad. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling cashier that wasn’t the girls credit card?
content: 
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

"title: AITA for telling my GF's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?
content: Me and Diomara (12F) have had a rough summer.  She's been more defiant than usual.  I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200B;

This summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200B;

I didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200B;

I'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200B;

That killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.""

&#x200B;

A couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my Inlaws exactly where my husband was when I was in labor?
content: I gave birth to my son 10 weeks ago. I went through exhausting period while I was nearing my due date. I was experiencing discomfort and wanted my husband by my side when I go into labor but he'd go out every night to hang out at his friend's place and watch football games. I suggested that he play/watch games at home just in case but he was having none of it and said he had to attend game night at his brother& friend's place along with his buddies. He said they had certain... How can i describe it? ""rituals?"" when watching a game and he can't enjoy doing it at home or anywhere else.

The night of our son's birth my water broke while my husband was at his buddies place watching a game. I called him and told him to get home and take me to the hospital he said he was coming but he didn't. I ended up calling my sister (she lives nearby) and she took me to the hospital. My husband showed up 2hrs later after he kept calling asking if I was still in labor and that he was almost done watching the game.

He was able to make it on time for our son's birth but I was furious with him, mad and disappointed. He apologized profoundly and has been working on regaining my trust and respect for him after what he's done. He's otherwise very supportive and involved in our son's care.

Last night I was at my in-laws house for dinner and we were talking about my son's birth date. My husband suddenly started ""recalling"" what happened that night and basically started lying about driving me to the hospital, waiting and feeling stressed out and standing on his feet for so long without food or even water. I was confused I said no! none of this was true, none of this happened in fact, he was watching a game when I went into labor and I wanted him to drive me to the hospital but didn't show up til 2 hours later. My mother in law who takes no shit from anybody and whom everyone *fears* lost it on him yelling asking him if that was true and he kept quiet. she started berating him left and right telling him to sit down and shut up when he stood up to argue then told him to stand up when he was sitting arguing. Everyone was laughing at how she basically treated him as if he was a boy in trouble. She kept saying ""Shame shame shame! on you, this is not how I raised my children to treat their wives, Jordan you are a disgrace and I'm disappointed because of what I heard about you"". He literally swallowed every bit of his mother's berating and didn't say anything til we got home where he went nuts saying I made him look neglectful, a bad husband and father by telling the family about where he was and said I shouldn't have said anything but I argued it wasn't okay for him to lie and play hero in front of his parents. He said I just caused a rift between him and family and asked if I was happy now.

aita? Should I have not said anything?

EDIT to say that he's done similar things in the past since he's a major enthusiast of football and hockey but I didn't expect it to get to that. Also this is not our first baby together, we have a 4 year old son.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my SIL no cares that she’s pregnant
content: I’m on mobile and my grammar will probably be bad because after today I needed to to get drunk 


Backstory my cousin (33f) who I’ll call mary lost her husband (32m) and two of her three children (3f) and (9months male) in a car accident last week. Her and her daughter (5) are as you would expect it’s just heartbreaking 


Well today was the funeral my brother’s wife (26) announced her pregnancy the second the arrived at our house this morning we were like “ok congratulations but please keep it on the down low for today”

Well when we arrived at the church she kept making gagging sounds and robbing her stomach saying “I as a mom can’t imagine what she is going through” they have no kids so people would look at her and she’d tell them she was pregnant 


Afterwards at my aunts house my sil kept making everything about her like someone’s in the bathroom sil would loudly say “pregnant lady needs to pee” 
She literally told my cousins sister give her, her seat so “the lady with a baby could rest her feet”

I ignored her till she came to Mary stuck out her flat belly and said “me and Issac just found out I was pregnant and honestly we are beside ourselves it could happen to us” Mary broke down 

I snapped like who says that to a woman who just literally lost two babies?? I said loudly to my sil “no gives a fuck you’re pregnant look around it’s not just one but two babies  funerals not to mention the love of Mary’s life like I knew you were an attention seeker but for fuck sake you took the test four days ago just leave” 

she left did in tears and my bother called me a fat bitter bitch 

I’ve gotten phone calls form my bother and sil family calling me the world of name because I made a pregnant woman cry 

If I’m being honest even tho Mary and my aunt thanked me because it was all making her upset I feel worse about making a scene 

Please put me in my place if I’m wrong

They both came at me screaming and yelling about sil feelings and she could miscarry from the stress I  caused her again i told them a  Funeral especially one for two children isn’t the time to announce a pregnancy and get the fuck out of my face .

"title: AITA for telling my SIL that I don't care that her baby died and to leave me alone?
content: Me and SIL, Daisy, have been friends since High School (15 years ago). I started dating her brother, Dan, when we were all in college. Daisy married Matt sometime after I married Dan 10 years ago. 

Matt and Daisy wanted a baby and starting trying right after marriage but they were having a lot of trouble. I am talking multiple failed IVF's, multiple late term miscarriages (one of which was a stillbirth). The struggle went on for for 7 years. 

I have helped her immensely through everything, financially and emotionally. Matt is... unsympathetic sometimes. He behaves as if it's a batch of bad cookies and immediately guilts her into trying again. So, it always was up me and Dan to take care of her. Despite many talks from me and Dan, she remained married to him and kept trying again and again. We have had many offers to leave the state/country for a better job, but didn't because we were scared to leave her alone. 

3 years ago, I got pregnant. We broke the new gently to Daisy one day. She got real quiet and then asked us to leave. Later, she sent me an email saying she doesn't want to see me or Dan anymore and that this is all too much. We tried to console her but didn't work, so gave her space. 

2 weeks before I was supposed to give birth, Dan passed away in an accident. I don't have any family except for Dan and Daisy. Daisy refused to attend the funeral because she will have to see me. The day before the funeral and I called her and begged her to come. I didn't think that I would be able to go through that without her. She hung up on me and didn't attend the service. 

Soon after that, I gave birth and I decided to move to another state. I cut off all contact with Daisy and started fresh. Now, me and my daughter are very happy and we are enjoying a comfortable life. She attempted to contact me once I moved away but I ignored her. 

2 weeks ago, she called from an unknown number and said she desperately wanted to talk to me. Turns out she finally got pregnant, had a baby boy who passed away 5 days after being born in NICU. Matt is also leaving her and screwed her over because of the prenup. She is basically broke and homeless days after losing a child. I just said ""Ok"". She then asked ""Are you really not going to say anything? You are really not going to help?""

I pretty much said, ""I don't care about you. I don't care about your life. I don't care about Matt. I don't care that your baby died. Just leave me and my daughter alone."" and then hung up. 

Since then she has been sending me multiple emails and vm's stating how awful I am and how heartless and how much Dan would be disappointed. I continued to just ignore everything. 

So, AITA?. 

Edit: Please don't DM me about leaving a person homeless during pandemic. I am already aware of the fact. I don't care. No matter what anyone says I am not going to have any sympathy or help her in any way. I am only asking for a judgement on what I said and how I said it.

Edit 2: I am getting a lot of annoying DM's because someone cross posted this somewhere else. Please stop. 

Edit 3: Please stop giving me unsolicited advise regarding changing my mind about helping her. That's not going to happen. If I wanted advice, I would have posted it in relationship_advice, not here. I only asked you to judge what I said to her and how I said it. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ADVICE. So, please stop.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my brother in law he's a walking advertisement for abortion?
content: My wife was more than five months pregnant when we learned that our daughter would not survive outside the womb. We were devastated, as this was a very wanted pregnancy. My wife made the difficult decision to have an induction abortion. The procedure itself went as expected, and she is physically fine. Emotionally, we are both still grieving. I was with her the whole time.

Yesterday, we had a family gathering. My family knew we were expecting, and I had the horrible job of telling them we had lost the baby. My parents and sister expressed their sympathies. However, bil, who is extremely pro-life, throughout the night told my wife repeatedly her that she was a murderer and that she killed her own daughter, and all sorts of other awful things that made her feel much worse. I was appalled when I caught him doing this, and my wife was on the verge of breaking down all over.

I yelled at him, pointing out how he had gotten a DUI in the past that put another person in the hospital, how he was working a low-paying job selling cigarettes that kill thousands of people every year at a convenience store, and how I had needed to bail him and my sister out financially more than once for medical reasons. Then I ended with ""If anything, you're a walking advertisement for abortion. Your mother probably wishes she had aborted you.""

I took my wife home, furious. Then later, I got a call from my sister. She apologized initially, saying she realized what her husband had said was out of line, but then tried to justify it by pointing out that he was raised to believe abortion was wrong. I should have been more understanding, and it was unfair of me to point out his past struggles when he had been doing better recently. I cussed her out and hung up, but now I'm wondering if I did go too far? AITA for basically telling my brother in law he should have been aborted?

Update: thank you all so much for the support. My sister called me a few hours ago, and we talked. It turns out she didn't know what he had actually said. He made it seem like he had just said he disagreed with abortion, which I would say is still unacceptable to tell grieving parents. But when I told her what he actually said, she was horrified. She apologized profusely and is now considering leaving him (there were a lot of other red flags in their relationship). She's now fully on our side and can't believe her husband could be so vile",nta
"title: AITA for telling my brother in law that paternity tests aren't automatic
content: UPDATE: wow this got a lot of comments!!!

So I have done a LOT of snooping. And it is way more soap opera than I thought.

1) apparently since child 1 didn't look like him at all, she made up the paternity test scheme to trick him into marrying her. But, THEY ACTUALLY DID PATERNITY TEST THAT KID and the real test said her ex was the dad. But he refused so she lied about the result, and my bfs bro never asked to see the papers

2) it gets worse. She's been secretly collecting child support from bio dad, and using it as get secret slush fund, while being a stay at home mom and making husband pay her way

3) she cheated on him A LOT and figured that she could lie again if the kids weren't his, and secretly rake in the child support. So, each baby she had tested, but the next two were his.

4) he decided to stay bc the kids - but he called the baby daddy of Kid 1 and explained the whole situation.

5) Baby Daddy of kid 1 is in negotiations for visitation or to cease child support.


ORIGINAL POST

A while back I started buying a house w my boyfriend. We decided to let his brother and his brother's wife and kids live with us.

The wife and I each got pregnant within a few months of each other, and so the house was totally wrapped up in baby preparations.

Well, when it's her turn to give birth, he gets back with her and he's all aglow and happy saying how much the new baby looks like him, and he says ""I couldn't deny her [the baby] if I tried even without the paternity test!""

I thought this was a weird thing to say. As far as I knew, their relationship was good, so I didn't see why they would do a test.

The first time he said it I let it go, but he said it a few times to a few family friends and it really started to bother me. Especially that everyone just took it in stride.

Finally, when everyone was gone various places, I asked what he meant by that. I was like ""you keep talking about a paternity test what's that about"" and he said it was ""the one they do when a baby gets born, at the hospital"" and I asked what he meant and he got frustrated and said ""you know the one they always do at the hospital when a baby gets born, like you guys when yours was born, so they can put it on the birth certificate.""

The confused me even more. I explained to him we didn't have one done, that we filled out the birth certificate paperwork beforehand, and all they did was ask my bf if he was the dad and he said yeah so they marked it down.

He got really quiet, and it kinda clicked for me that something was up, so I said ""maybe it's because I have different insurance"" because that's all I could think of.

Well he shut himself in his room, and when his wife got back they had a huge fight, and it turns out she's been cheating on him for like six years. 

Everyone is upset with me for telling him, because it ruined their happiness about their new baby. Am I the asshole?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my brother that his crush dislikes him because he’s an asshole, not because he’s “too smart”?
content: So I have a younger brother (13) who is a child prodigy. I won’t give too many details but he’s well known in the academic circles of our country and attends an institute of higher education. Naturally people are impressed with his intelligence and he’s quite popular and makes friends easily. Our parents dote on him and have never told him “no”. As a result he has become very arrogant, condescending and disrespectful to people he deems below him...that’s just about everyone.  

Lately he’s been openly talking about a girl he’s crushing on and much to his dismay she’s quite unimpressed with him. He often complains to my parents and I about his failed attempts to befriend her. 

I understand why she dislikes him. On one occasion he invited her over for a school project and I overheard their interaction. He was constantly talking over her, dismissing her ideas and even calling them stupid. 99% of the time he was talking about himself and his accomplishments, being in news articles, his future plans are etc. The poor girl obviously seemed uncomfortable. He quizzed her about her career aspirations and when she answered he proceeded to point out it’s a bad career path. 

Today he was once again complaining about her and said that she’s obviously intimidated by his superior intellect. He claimed that all girls only like “stupid guys” and that “women are emotional”.  Sadly my parents agreed and kept assuring him that this girl is obviously uncomfortable with the fact he’s so accomplished and awesome.  


After hearing this nonsense many times, I finally told him that his crush dislikes him because he behaves like an obnoxious, know-it-all asshole. 
I explained that he’d probably have a chance if he showed some modesty instead of talking down on this girl so much. 

So my parents obviously think I’m an asshole for saying this. They said that it was horrible of me to say this to a 13 year old and that he’s just a child. I told them that he needs to realise that his personality is becoming a problem and that his crush dislikes him because he’s an AH, not because he’s “too smart”. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my cousin I won’t make an exception for her son at my wedding?
content: I (26F) am getting married in about two months. I sent out my wedding invitations recently and at the bottom it says “ADULTS ONLY. NO EXCEPTIONS.” First let me say that I love kids. But my fiancé and I made the decision to not allow kids/babies to our ceremony because they get bored, cry, won’t sit still, have tantrums... and I just don’t want that to happen during our wedding. We’re also going to have an open bar, and I don’t particularly want a bunch of drunk adults around my little cousins or my friend’s children. 

I have a cousin, we’ll call her Sam, that text me last night saying “so you’re dead honest seriously telling me I cannot bring (her son) to your wedding”- to which I said yes. Sam responds “then I can’t come and that f****** kills me. I just want you to know how badly I want to be there and I have dreamt my entire life of standing next to you at your wedding. But I just can’t want to be somewhere with someone who doesn’t want the other half of my heart there.” 

She’s trying guilt trip me into letting her bring her son. Saying “and I’ve confided in my best friends and they say it’s your wedding it’s your right to have it the way you want, but yeah. I just want you to know it’s not vengeance when I don’t come. I’ll probably cry like a b**** the entire day.” I suggested that she take her son (he’s seven) to his friends house for a few hours, so that she can attend. She says “I can’t just tell him no and leave him somewhere. I’m not strong enough to do that to his sensitive little heart. I could, if he wasn’t so aware and sensitive. It would hurt him too much. He’s too smart to manipulate.”

I’m not asking her to manipulate her son. I’m asking that she be an adult, and tell him he can’t come and that children aren’t allowed to attend, so she’ll take him to his friends while she’s gone.

Not to mention, that she’s angry that I didn’t choose her to be my Maid of Honor. I chose my step-sister. While on the phone, Sam said “I don’t mean any offense by this, but FUCK HER.” She’s literally only mad because my dad cheated on my mom 10 years ago and married the woman he cheated with. She hates my sister, because she hates my step mom. 

I ended up being on the phone with her for half an hour talking to her about this. With her constantly telling me “I’m trying to get sober, so I just wanted to talk to you and tell you how I feel.” Which to me, sounds like she’s going to blame me if I still tell her no, and she decides to drink/so drugs again. 

We ended the phone call with her saying “will you just promise me one thing, even if it’s a lie? Will you just promise me that you’ll consider it, and that you’ll talk to your fiancé about it?” So I told her yes, that I promised I’d consider it/talk to him about it. And I did, I considered it, I talked (angry cried) to him, and I’m not changing my mind. 

Am I the Asshole?

***************************************

UPDATE: I texted her two days ago, and used the wording suggested by u/sunny_sally. 

“There’s nothing I want more than for you to be at my wedding. I love (her son), but after speaking to (fiancé), we came to the conclusion that we still do not feel comfortable having kids at our wedding. This is a decision we made before we started the planning, knowing that some people might disagree with it. If you aren’t able to get a baby sitter, I would completely understand why you wouldn’t come. And I also spoke with (her step dad), he said he will be attending.”

She responded in less than a minute and said “ok.”

So I guess we’ll see how this goes.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad [50M].
content: My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it. 

I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my daughter to get over herself?
content: I was blessed with three beautiful children and unfortunately, my eldest, Brooke, passed away when she was 5 years old. It rocked my world and I know I haven’t been the same since. I went through therapy and still attend to this day, but a part of me died too.

I will never let my daughter be forgotten. I bring pictures of her to events such as holiday celebrations and birthdays. I talk about her all the time. Every year on my living children’s birthdays, I think of her and how her once younger siblings are now older than her. 

My daughter, Marnie, is getting married next month. I asked her if she was having a memorial table and she said no. I asked her about creating a seat for her sister who passed, as she should be a part of the day. Marnie told me no, for once she wants a day about her. She says she couldn’t have one event that wasn’t about Brooke. Even her graduation, I had put a picture of her on the seat. She said I needed to stop making my grief “front stage”.

I told her she was being incredibly selfish and until she goes through a loss like this, she’ll never understand. Marnie asked me if her kids would have to live under the shadow of Brooke too. I told her she should be ashamed and to get over herself.

My son says I’m being terrible and I need to re-evaluate my life. AITA?",yta
"title: AITA for telling my ex his lack of money is not my issue?
content: I (36F) have a daughter Sadie (12) with my ex-husband John (39). We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.

I have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. 

Well, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.

The problem came when I went to pick her up last weekend.I had a business meeting and couldn't drive her over, so Amanda offered to just pick Sadie up from school, which hadn't happened before. When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.

They sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.

I told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.

They've been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me a selfish AH, and after telling the story to a friend, he told me I was rubbing my success in their face, but I still don't feel like I did anything wrong. Still, AITA?

EDIT: I got temporary guardianship while waiting for a court hearing. We're going to try to get full custody and have John get one day a week of visitation, supervised for at least the first few months, and no contact with Amanda or her kids.This way, he still sees Sadie just as much and they can try to repair their relationship, but she doesn't have to go back there. All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back. I've talked to Sadie and we've decided that she's going to try therapy for a little while to help deal with everything that's happened.

UPDATE: We've had the hearing and our custody arrangement's been modified. Any and all decisions relating to Sadie are made by me, and me alone. John has supervised visitation once a week, and Sadie will continue in therapy to deal with all the issues Amanda and co. have caused her. 

They tried to push for 50/50 custody split on grounds of alienation (so me trying to put Sadie against her father), but we made it clear from the start that we wanted to keep Amanda and her children away, and wanted supervision only because we don't feel safe leaving him alone as of yet, but that we were open to modifications. Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. 

Amanda's pissed, and has tried to contact me and Sadie, but I made it clear to her that if she keeps harrassing me or my daughter, I'll have to make this known to the authorities. Sadie and I have blocked her everywhere, and any communication between John and us is made through text messages or emails only. 

I'd like to thank you all for your support throughout all of this, it really means a lot to us. Sending you loads of love!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?
content: We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?
content: Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.

Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""

I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""

He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""

I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""

The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""

He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.

I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?

He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.

So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""

He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.

Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.

AITA?

**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.

Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.

The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.

Also, we don't do Christmas. 

Check your biases, folks. Don't leap to conclusions based on what you *want* to have happened.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it makes her uncomfortable?
content: My late best friend and I knew each other since we were little. We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.

One day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren’t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.

A few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our ""wedding anniversary"" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.

4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.

Today was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it’s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.

I was furious at her comments because she wasn’t just a “dead girl”. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It’s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.

When I told her that I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came back home yet.",nah
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend she isn’t welcome at my house anymore unless she seriously fixes her attitude regarding my best friend?
content: Disclaimer: no, I am not seeking relationship advice or validation on it. I am seeking judgement on refusing to let her come to my house. 

I (30M) live with my best buddy Mark (30). We decided 2 years ago, we were sick of paying high rent costs and having shitty roommates so we pooled our money together to put a deposit down on a house. It’s a good arrangement as we both have our own separate spaces, it’s cheaper paying a mortgage and we do everything jointly. We’ve also been best friends for 20+ years and enjoy living together. It’s also important to note that I am straight and Mark is gay, but this has never bothered me and it doesn’t impact how I see him. 

Mark is single after a breakup right now and I’ve been seeing Hannah (was seeing her?) for about a year. I told her right from the start about my living arrangements so in case she ever came to my house, she knew Mark lived there too. It never seemed to be an issue until Mark and his boyfriend broke up and Hannah’s attitude changed. She started making comments saying she was uncomfortable with him around me and that he was “making eyes” at me a lot. I told her she was being ridiculous, so did Mark and we both laughed at the idea of being into each other. We’re complete opposites and are more like brothers and it weirds us both out that Hannah is making comments.

I have told Hannah multiple times to stop as this is Mark’s house too and I won’t have him feeling shitty. Hannah just keeps ramping it up and her comments are getting worse to the point she even said he wanted to make a move on me. I finally snapped. I told her that being gay doesn’t automatically mean he wants to sleep with me and her attitude is disgusting. She said she was joking and I said it didn’t feel like a joke. I told her “if you seriously can’t change your attitude and treat Mark like a person, then you’re not welcome here anymore. You’re 30, act like it. Get out.”

Hannah has been calling me an AH for treating her like a child and some of her friends have messaged me saying I am being too harsh. I’m asking for judgement as I may be the AH for being too firm and not trying to talk to her about why she is speaking about Mark this way instead of downright refusing to let her be near him.

Update: I have come to the conclusion Hannah and I are no more. Thank you for your comments.

Update 2: this post received a lot more attention than I thought. I will happily do an update post for all you lovely people.

Final update: love who you love! Gay, straight, bi, pan, whatever, who cares? Love whoever you wanna love and enjoy your lives!!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs treatment?
content: My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice), meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes in.

It's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed) so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours) she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold. I told her that her this situation is ""ridiculous"", and she needs to ""get some therapy"" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know how she intends to get through life like this.

She was extremely upset and told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she tried to get some help. 

Just to add, she is okay going outside in the cold air, but as usual won't touch anything cold.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my inlaws about what their son's girlfriend did to my son's blanket and causing her to get shunned?
content: 

I F,33 found out that my ex husband M, 37 was cheating on me when I was 7 months pregnant with our son. I got a divorce and we share custody of our 3 yro old son. My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her ""house"" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.


I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.


I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as ""punishment"" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.

My ex husband called me yelling about my ""pathetic attempt"" to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her ""future inlaws"". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my mom she’s a whore?
content: Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I’m currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I’s relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn’t even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I’d see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn’t understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this “family friend”. They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I’ve confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it’s very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she’s just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it’s been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn’t agree with it, it’s been years, he wasn’t in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

“To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy’s marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn’t ruin this one, but why don’t you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?”

She cried, said she couldn’t believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven’t spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy’s marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she’s selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad?

"title: AITA for telling my mom we haven’t had a good relationship in a long time and I wanted to go live with my dad?
content: I (16F) used to have a good relationship with my mother. That has since crashed and burned since she dated and married my stepdad “Gary” six years ago. Gary treats his son “Ian” (19M) like he’s the center of the universe and expects my mother to as well, so she does. Anything Ian wants, Ian gets and that usually comes at the expense of me. Ian wanted my room when they moved it? I was forced to go to another room to “make the transition easier for everyone.” Ian wanted a car for his 16th birthday? I didn’t get braces for another year. Ian wanted to go on an expensive trip for Spring Break? I had to give up Volleyball to make it happen. Ian wanted to have his side of the family over? I was expected to find somewhere else to be, since I wasn’t family. My mother just went along with all of this and acted like it shouldn’t affect me at all.

My dad was overseas for a long time, and we used to FaceTime and he was so upset by what he was hearing. He’s home now and he’s offering to have me come live with him. I’m not seeing a reason not to go, and so I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She predictably freaked out and asked why I’d want to do that and said that we had such a good relationship, she didn’t understand how this came so out of the blue. I told her that we haven’t had a good relationship since she blindly decided to follow Gary’s lead and give Ian anything he wanted, and it always came at my expense. My mom tried to argue so I said, I also wanted to leave because she let them kick me out of my own house because ”I wasn’t family” so I was going to go live with someone who was. My mom started crying and said she wouldn’t let me go, so I told her that my dad was willing to go to court over it and I was old enough to be able to say where I wanted to be. 

She’s been a crying mess since I told her, and Gary is being a jackass about how awful I’m being.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. He was bitching at me about how terribly I’m treating them and how I’m not thinking about them at all. I asked why should I, he never thought of me when he was taking things from me to give to his kid. I said let’s face facts here, you don’t care about me, what you care about is losing the child support you spend on your son. He sort of went slack jawed and I walked off. My dad said my mom called and threatened to take him to court, so he said he’d see her there. Now she’s panicking because she realized he is planning on taking her to court over this. Mom and Gary of course think I’m the asshole for “making things hard” for everyone, but my dad and grandparents say to leave and never look back.

"title: AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?
content: So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

Was I in the wrong?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my new co worker it was misleading of him to be wearing his wedding band when he's a widower?
content: 

Hi. A couple of weeks ago we had a new employee hired at the company. he's a good guy and a widower named ""James"" (36) and to my knowledge his late wife passed away 8 months ago. Me (f32) and the other coworkers got along well with him. However I noticed that he is still wearing his wedding band on his finger. It kind of confused me a bit and I couldn't help but bring it up with him while on lunch break.


We talked and I pointed out that he was being misleading by still wearing his wedding band when he's a widower. He looked quite bothered by what I said but I tried to explain that I think that he was giving people the wrong idea or impression about his relationship status since he's technically single and on his own right now (don't want to sound cruel but I'm speaking from technical angle).
James said that he didn't give it much thought (meaning he don't care what people think) and that even if he wasn't wearing his wedding band and some woman approached him he'd still turn them down since he's obviously not interested.

For some reason things got awkward and everyone stopped eating and just stared at James and me.
I told him I don't know but that really really felt generally misleading of him as in making people think he is in a relationship (married) when he is not regardless of how he felt about being in a relationship. He got upset, called me rude, and said that I repeatedly disrespected his marriage and his late wife's memory with what I said then took his stuff and walked away. My co workers said regardless of who is right or wrong (though some said he overreacted) there was no reason for me to bring this up on the first place and cause a scene and make James upset with us like that now he's not speaking to me and others who sided with me.


AITA? Did I overstep or did he overreact?

This was just a conversation we were casually having with the other co workers and I didn't use any insensitive tones or anything but we had a discussion and it suddenly turned into an argument. I tried to let things calm down but the situation got out of my hand unexpectedly.",yta
"title: AITA for telling my niece to stay in the closet until she gets her inheritance?
content: My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian.  I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.

However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.

My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.

Since both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.

She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.

My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.

I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.

Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?

**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.  She is a powerful advocate of LGBTQ+ rights so she had an angry knee-jerk reaction to my dad's bigotry.**",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents they were bad parents to me?
content: I (19M) have an autistic brother (20M). He’s fairly manipulative because he realized pretty quickly that the threat of a meltdown would get him his way every single time. He is considered high functioning by medical personnel, but he’s got my parents convinced he just doesn’t understand what he’s doing, and they don’t ever punish him. Doctors have told them that he understands and that he knows what he’s doing. They think they know better. They also expect me to revolve my entire life around him. I was never able to do anything I wanted because it upset his routine. I wanted to play a sport, nope his routine. I wanted to get a job? Nope, his routine. Friends? Yeah forget about that. I tried not to be resentful, but I am.

The problem: My parents are flipping out because I plan to move several states away and in with my grandparents soon to attend school. They keep trying to guilt me into staying because of my brother. I usually just say that I’m sorry that they feel that way, but I’m still going. Well here’s where I might be the asshole. My mother was going on and on about how the world doesn’t revolve around me and how I was being really selfish and how I was going to ruin my brother by doing this. How they’d always been the best parents they could be to both of us and we both got equal attention.

I got frustrated and told her that she was delusional if she thought she or my father were ever good parents to me. They made my life revolve around my brothers, I had nothing of my own, he had to be the center of everything. I said He wasn’t the center of the universe even though she tried to make him it. I told her that the only people who were selfish were her and my father because they actively ignored me in favor of babying my brother who played them like a fiddle to make sure he always got his way. I told her that his routine was not my problem, that it was up to them to make the appropriate adjustments, and asked if she really thought I’d just not live my life because of him?

She started crying and I walked off and shut myself in my room. My father is demanding an apology for what I said, but I’m refusing. My grandpa said he’s proud that I stood up for myself, but my parents are still demanding an apology for being an asshole. I don’t think I need to give them one. AITA here?",nta
"title: AITA for telling my parents to stop hooking me up with single girls from their church? AITA for not wanting to get married?
content: The last year and a half has been hard for me, to say the least.

Last March, my brilliant and hilarious and beautiful girlfriend Natalie suddenly passed away.  Everyone always gave shit about us because of politics.  We met in college when were were poly sci majors: she is very liberal (think AOC) and I'm pretty conservative.  We actually met because we were serving as treasurers for our school's College Democrats and Young Republicans clubs, respectively, and our groups would get together for drinks or bowling or laser tag once a month.  

Well, Natalie and I bonded over a lot of shared interests and we hit it off.  Even if we didn't see eye to eye on many issues, debating her was stimulating and formed the cornerstone of our relationship.  We've had debates that went on until dawn.  We just bounced off each other.  She liked to joke that we were ""drift compatible"".  

I wanted to marry this woman, but she passed away before we got a chance to talk about marriage.  I'm in therapy and I'm working through working through not having her in my life anymore, but it's been rough.  Then 'Rona happened and I got laid off, so I had to move back in with my parents and figure out what I am supposed to do now.

My parents mean well, but they got married really young and are more conservative and religious than me.  They've been trying to set me up on dates with single girls from their church since I moved back home.  But I don't want to date these girls.

No offense to them, but it's a small town in the American Breadbasket.  They don't share the same interests as me and it feels like their only goal in life is to be a good Christian wife and produce a lot of babies.  Trying to talk to them about current events is excruciating for me.  The girls my parents tried to set me up with take everything they read on Facebook or hear from Fox News for face value.  It makes me miss Natalie and our debates more. 

My parents mean well.  I know they want me to find a nice girl and settle down with her, but not like this.  They are nothing like Natalie and never will be.  I miss her, even if my folks didn't like her ideas.  

But when I told them the other night that I wanted them to stop setting me up on dates with these girls, they freaked out and told me that I needed to consider settling down since I just turned thirty.  They're good girls from great families, I know that, and my parents like them more than they liked Natalie, but she was my one and only.  I don't think it's fair for anyone when I still love her.  

They are even more angry at me because I told them that I just don't see myself getting married anytime soon.  But like I said, Natalie was my soulmate and I just can't see myself being with anyone else but her.  Yet, they are insisting that I need to find a woman and settle down and give them grandchildren.

Edit:  We were seriously close to talking about marriage.  But around the time she died, it was more like how funny it would be if the bridal party wore blue and the groomsmen wore red because the bride is a Democrat and the groom is a Republican/Romeo and Juliet deal.

Fuck, I wish we got to do that.  Natalie thought it was hilarious.

Edit of the edit:  Sweet Disney's ghost!  I am ashamed to admit this, but I broke down when I saw all of your responses.  Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all great and wonderful people and God will reward you for your kindness.  Your support is overwhelming.  I haven't felt this supported in a very, very long time.  

I am reading all of your comments.  Thank you, thank you so much.  I've been feeling so lost for a long time, and with the virus it has been sending me into a tailspin.  I am saving this post so when I feel dark, I can come here and read your comments and I know that even though we are strangers, we have each others backs.  

And in this day and age, we need it even more than ever.  God bless you all!",nta
"title: AITA for telling my roommate that the name she chose for her baby is ‘ridiculously stupid’?
content: My roommate  (24f) is a big Game of Thrones fan. She’s pregnant with her first child right now. She decided to name her baby, ‘Arya’. When she asked my opinion of this name, I said I it was a good name with a good meaning (Arya means noble in Sanskrit), but a lot of people have named their kids Arya/Khaleesi/Sansa because of the popularity of GoT and it might be a little too common, not that it is a bad thing.

The next day, which was yesterday, she said she’s found a way to name her baby ‘Arya’ and not have it be associated with other Aryas running around or the show. How? She said she wanted to spell it as *Aughreighyah*. I did a double take reading that word too, but apparently people are supposed to read it as Augh-reigh-ya or Arya. 

She asked me how I felt about it and I told her that, frankly, Aughreighyah looks ridiculously stupid and she should just go with Arya. She got kinda upset and said that she and her partner came up with this only because I told them that the name is very common. I said that having a common name is better than having a confusing name.

"title: AITA for telling my sister I don't trust her to watch my son?
content: I'm a 19 year old man with a 3mo old son. His mother surrendered her rights and is no longer in the picture. I work 4am-12pm at a gas station and I raise my son, that's what I do these days. Only one of my friends still speaks to me and hangs out with me. I live at home with my parents and sister (21) and pay a small rent each month. I can't afford to move out with the baby. My parents help me when they can. My sister doesn't like my son, she once told me she thinks he's an annoyance and hinderance. If he cries she complains. If there's baby clothes in the laundry she complains. Basically the baby exists and that pisses her off. I'm not perfect but I'm trying my best to be a good dad. My sister has never offered to help with the baby beyond holding him briefly and she hasn't done that more than about four or five times since he was born.

The other day my friend called and offered me a really great opportunity for some side-work. He works construction and they needed an extra guy for some installation work. Four hours and I'd get $400.00. I jumped at it, any extra money can only help. I started trying to find a babysitter. My sister was hanging out in the living room while I walked around the house on the phone. I managed to find a sitter who said she didn't want to be paid and went to get the baby ready. My sister asked me why I didn't ask her when she was sitting right there. I told her I didn't think she'd want to since she'd never offered to help before. She told me it was different, this was for work and not just me wanting to sleep or whatever, and he was about to go down for his nap and he's pretty easy when first wakes up, she told me it wouldn't be a problem.

I asked her why she didn't say something between phone calls and she said she didn't think she needed too because we're family and family asks each other for help. I reminded her of all the times she'd complained about the baby and me and called him names and told me she waited he'd never been born and asked her why she thought I'd ever trust her with my son. She started crying and told me that wasn't fair and I needed to remember that the whole house was dealing with a baby and she was just having a hard time adjusting but she'd never do anything to hurt him. I told her she should have spoken to me about her feelings instead of acting like a child, took my son and left. When I got home both my parents set in on me because my sister told them I'd accused her of bad intentions to the baby. AITA for being honest when my sister offered to babysit?

ETA: apparently God is on my side right now. The lady I mentioned in the post who babysat my son for me, she goes to church with my mom and when I dropped my son off I explained that I was having trouble finding a sitter or paying for daycare. She called the pastor and explained the situation and two days a week my son can attend the church nursery school from 7am-12pm for free!!, and the lady has offered to take my son one day a week during the same time-frame and has also found another lady who will take him for one day a week, same time-frame. The ladies both requested $50.00, which I'm happy to pay. That means there's only one day a week and three hours in the mornings that I need childcare and my mom has agreed to watch him for the three hours and drop him off! I still have to figure out Fridays but Monday-Thursday are covered. I can breathe again.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister she was out of her mind when she said she wanted to take back my child whom I adopted from her?
content: My (36) sister N (29) got pregnant at 18. I am infertile and knew I couldn't have kids so when N said she was giving her baby for adoption, I decided to be her mom. N went no contact 5 months after giving birth. For a bit of background, N got pregnant by a one night stand and she apparently didn't remember or know the father at the time of birth but when V was 2, a man T (35) messaged me on social media claiming to be the father of my child. N had run into him at a club and drunkenly confessed to the pregnancy. We met up, he bonded with his daughter and well that man is now my husband of 7 years. Coming back to my sister, she called me yesterday. Although I was surprised at her call, I picked up. We made some small talk,  then she said she had just gotten married a year back and both of them wanted children but couldn't because her husband was infertile but really wanted kids. I asked her if she wanted to adopt and she said she would just need to get her baby back. I was speechless for a few moments before replying that if she wants to meet my child as an aunt she is welcome to and we both can sit V down and explain the reason for her absence but she can't just ask me to give up my child. She said she'll sue me as she's the birth mother. I told her she was out of her mind and I told her about T. She exploded. Calling me names and saying I stole her life. I got too emotional and hung up. T came home from work and on explaining to him, he was beyond furious. I then got a call from my parents saying I was an asshole for telling N she couldn't she her baby. I said I never said that and I welcomed her to bond with V but they refused to listen and said I was being insensitive and harsh and flaunting my family.

I now feel bad because me and N were very close as sisters and I feel quite close to her situation since I know the struggles of infertility. T said there was no way he was letting my sister have full time and I agree but I want to know if am the asshole for being too harsh and telling her about T.

Edit - I did legally adopt V at birth. T adopted her too after we got married. N never wanted kids and I feel the only reason she wants V now is because her husband wants kids. I don't know but I think this is it and T agrees.

Edit 2 - For all the people wandering why I said we were close, I  meant growing up.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister there’s a reason her kids chose to live with their dad?
content: Throwaway. I (32F) have a 14 year old daughter Jess. Her father and my husband died in an accident when she was young, so it’s been just us two for a long time. As a result we are very close and she’s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they’ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first ‘boyfriend’. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it’s just the mum inside me but I couldn’t be happier for her. 

I went to my older sisters house for coffee earlier this morning. Backstory, my sister has two teenagers (16 and 17), who live almost full time with their dad. They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won’t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don’t want to live with her. 

My daughter came up in conversation and so bought up her first date. When I explained how it went, my sister laughed and told me that I must be joking. When she realised I was serious, she told me I was a terrible mother for letting my daughter walk all over me and not setting boundaries. She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said ‘I would never allow my kids to do that,’ so I replied by saying ‘That’s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.’ She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I’m wondering if I crossed the line.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family on me like it's supposed to mean something?
content: As stated in a prior post I was kicked out at 15 for being gay. From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.

My sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.

This was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as ""Family"" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.

I told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.

Before we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.

So AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?

&#x200B;

Edit. 

Good Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  

I wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. 

 My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  

I have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. 

I have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.

I guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly. 

Thank you all for all your replies and support!!! ",nta
"title: AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I’m no longer his Father?
content: Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we’d adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn’t find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he’s not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He’s an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It’s been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he’s busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it’s been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn’t stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn’t matter. Any time we’d actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I’d ask him how classes or friends were and he’d just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn’t even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he’d do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris’ because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him this “I can’t believe you are going to do this. That’s really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I’m no longer your Father and I don’t want to be involved in your life.” 

He hung up on me. I didn’t even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn’t respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he’s 22).

My family told me I’m being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it’s reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn’t speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn’t contact me. I didn’t contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he’s been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son’s inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this “Adam, you haven’t been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn’t sit well with me. That’s the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I’m not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend.” Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex’s affair. I don’t know if that’s the real reason he’s so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my surrogate to stop acting like she was my husband's wife?
content: 
My husband and I have been together for 5 years. We wanted kids but because of my health problems this wasn't possible.
We decided to go with surrogacy, my friend nominated her sister ( Brittany 29) I agreed right away cause I know Brittany and the family.
We've set everything up. Discussed payment, short and long term plans, counseling and dr appointments. We explored IVF and chose a private clininc to get it done.

It started after Brittany took a pregnancy test. She only told my husband though she had both our numbers. she only sent my husband a pic of the test while he was at work and sent me nothing when I gave her my personal contact info but it was okay. Things got complicated when Brittany started having access to our credit cards for her own wants and claim they were the baby's needs. She excluded me from dr visits and scans and had only my husband go with her. Her excuse was my husband drives and has time since I work and ""unavailable"" most of the time. I felt isolated from this experience but said nothing knowing she's bearing a lot of burden so I had patience. My husband had no idea what was going on and if this was normal. This was new to us so we didn't know.


She's 7 months in and last week she had us visit to discuss things that I thought we'd previously agreed on but she said she changed her mind about and her mom was there too. I heard Brittany out and was shocked when she gave a list of how things should be from now on since she said ""there was lot of confusion"" in the past cause of me stressing her out by complaining.
She requested she gets say in things like baby name after I ""deleted"" the list of names she sent to my husband.
She wanted more access to my husband's credit cards/free time to get stuff done at her place. Also more time with the baby than agreed on.
Then wrapped up by saying only my husband should be with her in the delivery room and used the hospital as excuse. I got up and firmly stated I don't agree on her new terms and that she had to stop acting like she was my husband's wife and this was their baby. My husband didn't speak til she started crying. He asked me to sit down but I said I had boundaries, reminded her what her role was and how she overstepped.

Her mom went off and and said her daughter was being mistreated when she put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for us, to make us a family. She gave up a part of her life in those months to give us what we want and I was acting selfish and ungrateful. She had us leave then told my friend and it got more complicated. I was told to apologize for what i said. IATA


Edit: yes, we agreed on paying for the surrogacy like I stated above. So no favors or anything.

Edit: No, we did not have a legal contract because my friend said there was no need for us to do that and basically talked us out of it since we are considered family but we had an agreement including paying her.

Edit: Question about whether Brittany had kids of her own. She was a single mom of a 4 year old who passed away from an accident. She had him at young age but she always seemed in good mental and physical health.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?
content: I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?

Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.

Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.

Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my wife that the only reason she says 'money doesn't matter' is because we're rich?
content: I (48M) and my wife (47F) both have very well paying jobs. I am a Pediatric Doctor and she's an Attorney, which have allowed us and our kids (20F), (17M) and (15M) to have a more than comfortable lifestyle. 

My wife has a tendency to say things like 'Money doesn't matter' and that 'material things don't matter' and she says them all the time, which kinda irks me because she's right, but I was raised in a poor family, and I know that she wouldn't be saying the same thing if we were middle-class. But I haven't said anything up until this morning. 

I had made a comment about needing a better watch, and my wife was saying her usual 'money doesn't matter'. I told her that she was only saying that because we are rich and because she has never experienced being without money in any sense. 

Predictably, she got upset with me, and now I'm wondering if perhaps I overreacted and went too far.",nta
"title: AITA for telling my wife’s friend she is too old and ugly after she repeatedly asked my 19-year-old son to take off his shirt? He was getting uncomfortable.
content: My family had a small get together at my house. One of my wife’s friends was over (she is unmarried I think she is 45-47)? We aren’t too close to her since she lives pretty far away. She was over our house and she started complimenting my son (my son is 19). It starts off innocent but as time goes on it gets more and more crossing the line. 

When we were out on my deck she starts telling my son to take his shirt off, 'whats the point of going to the gym if no one will see it.' My son is visibly uncomfortable and tries to shut her down. She repeatedly is asking and is getting more aggressive with it. I interject and I am like ""Hey Kathy, I think you are a bit too old and ugly for my son."" 

This got her upset really quickly, and she excuses herself to the bathroom and starts crying. My wife goes to comfort her, and then later she leaves. 

At the end of it my wife is super angry with me for saying that, that I should have said hey Cathy looks like you had too much to drink or something else. I told my wife, that Kathy (btw this is not her real name) works a corporate job she has had training on this and that she knows better. And our son was uncomfortable. He is 18+ but he doesn't know how to deal with an adult-adult let alone someone saying that in our house. 

I told my wife flat out that if I was to invite a guy friend and he was to ask to see our daughter in a bikini my wife would have called the police. She says its different. I tell her that I was way kinder to Kathy than I would have been had a guy said something like that to our daughter. And I told my wife that Kathy needs to apologize to my son before she can ever come into our house again. 

Overall, I think I was fair. If Kathy just said it once and I said that I think I would be the asshole, but the fact she kept repeating it that's why I said it. And I wanted her to get the message that yes I am upset that's why I included the ugly part.",nta
"title: AITA for telling the new neighbors that they got what they paid for, including being shunned by the neighborhood?
content: Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics – think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle.

My home’s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we’d hold parties, etc. It’s been a neighborhood treasure for years.

Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it.

The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s.

We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they’d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren’t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven’t been very friendly. The guy says that he’s surprised considering it felt like a “nice” and somewhat “affluent” neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors.

I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake?

They said they didn’t know what I meant, so I asked if they’d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.

I said “Yes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.""

The guy said “Well it’s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?”

I said “Well, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.” I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

My daughter was in second grade. She was in class and suddenly felt like she was going to vomit so she tried to run to the bathroom. She didn’t make it and vomited in the hallway. However she was sent to the office for running out of class without permission. The principal called me about this and I had to come in. He told me that she was being punished and was losing her privileges to go on the field trip the next week. I told him that was insane considering she did it because she was trying to keep from making a mess and she’s 7! She made a snap judgement that I think most people would make. On top of that, they sent her to the principal instead of the nurse. He refused to change the decision so I took my daughter out of school for the last 2 days of the week. Since she was missing the field trip I wanted her to have as much fun as possible so we went to an amusement park, the movies, and to paint pottery. She told her father about this during his visitation time and he got very angry at me for undermining the principal. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for telling this college guy's mom that her coming into his interview cost him the job?
content: I am a hiring manager at a tech company and I was hiring for summer internships a little while ago.

We had a guy, about 19 years old, applying for a summer internship between his freshman and sophomore years of college. It was a virtual interview over Zoom because of covid. 

A minute or two in, when I was introducing myself, his mom came in and introduced herself and started talking about her son's work ethic. I thought it was a little strange. I said something polite about wanting to hear from him.

She just didn't get the hint and kept coming into camera frame during the interview and interrupting her son to answer questions for him. I asked a few technical questions which he seemed to answer well and then cut the interview fairly short.

I thought that was all over and done with until I'd gotten an email from a woman, a month later, asking about her son's application, she seemed offended he hadn't gotten an acceptance or rejection. 

It bothered me, I felt bad for the kid honestly. Wayyy back when I was a teenager, my mom used to pull the same shit, but luckily she only did that when I was 15 and working for a day-camp, not when I was an adult applying for engineering jobs. But I felt like this poor kid was getting his chances ruined because his mom wasn't giving him the chance to apply on his own.

I sent an email back saying I was not at liberty to send information about an application to anybody but the applicant. I also asked HR to send an email to the kid saying sorry but we were not making him an offer. (It is something we usually do, but his rejection email must have slipped through the cracks with all the Covid craziness.)

Anyway, after we sent that, I got a phone call from his mom, she had a forwarded copy of the email, and she was demanding answers.

I said that I could not comment on the guy's performance in the interview to her as she was not the applicant. If he wanted to reach out to me I was happy to give him some feedback. 

However, I could say that regardless of his performance, her presence in the interview took him out of consideration for the position. We were looking for an independent and self-driven person for the position, and for that reason, it is important to see an applicant speak for themselves, follow-up themselves, etc.

I also said that, as a piece of advice, every hiring manager I've met in my career who sees someone other than the applicant answering questions during an interview, following up on the applicant's behalf, etc... Would also put their resume in the ""do not hire"" pile. Since, while the applicant may be skilled and motivated, they need the ability to demonstrate those traits themselves. 

She fucking blew up at me over that, kinda cussing me out to the point where I hung up.

"title: AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her ""You have to include everyone"" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson?
content: My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say ""No"" to things she feels uncomfortable with.

There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. 

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

OP

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?

////

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",nta

My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. 
A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. 
Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. 
Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said ""besides, he's right, kids need a mom"". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said ""see, it's even turning you into a pu**y"". 
My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said ""listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person"". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. 
She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless.

I was not thrilled but I provided all the help I could and took care of her. I was having a health crisis at the time so I was very stressed out. I love my grandchild but the birth didn't exactly happen in the happiest of circumstances.

My oldest daughter ended up back in a relationship with the baby's father and they are happy and stable now. 

My younger daughter announced her pregnancy a few months ago and the situation cannot be more different. She's married to her husband who she's been with for several years, they're both financially stable and the baby is clearly planned.

I have had zero stress dealing with my daughter's pregnancy this time and I've been generally happier about it. I was unknowingly proving I was more excited this time around which I have since corrected. I also planned a baby shower for my youngest which I didn't do for my oldest.

My oldest is furious. I can imagine why but I feel she should understand how different the circumstances were.

She's said some really hurtful things to me and has prevented me from seeing my grandchild, even on the phone. I have already apologized a few times but it hasn't made a difference.

My youngest is now having some pregnancy related health issues and we're feeling very scared. I got a text from my oldest yesterday that if it were her having a health scare during her pregnancy, I would've probably celebrated. I broke down crying because I was so hurt.

My daughter recieved a bike from her uncle (my brother) on her 11th birthday, she was over the moon and excited to use it because it was on her wishlist for so long.


Days ago, I discovered that my husband reached out to my brother to ask for the recipient for the bike and returned it to the store and kept the money for himself while my daughter was at school (the bike was at home). My daughter and I got home and she started crying after noticing the bike was gone. My husband was home at the time, he told me he returned the bike and got money in return to spend on something useful for us since the bike was just there as a ""distraction"" and there was no need for it now since we're the dead of winter. I was aggravated and lost it on him saying it wasn't his, didn't come from him, and he didn't pay for it so he had no right to touch it ESPECIALLY knowing our daughter's been wanting it for a long time and my brother was decent enough to buy it for her despite barely having money to get him by. I told him what he did was theft and insisted he hand over the money to me so I could re-purchase it but he said he spent it on stuff for the house and doesn't have any money left now but I knew about the money he was stashing away in the bedroom that he forbade me from toucing and I took some of it and went out to re-purchase the bike while he was out the next day.

He found out and verbally lashed out at me saying I should've never touched the money he was saving for himself which isn't much but I lashed right back that I had to so I could re-purchase the bike he took from under our daughter. He explained that he didn't keep the money for himself and instead spent it for necessities for our home but he was at fault for taking the bike in the first place and he was responsible for getting it back. He yelled at me for almost 10 minutes then stormed outside and started smoking.

My daughter asked why her dad was upset and that she no longer wants the bike if dad doesn't want her to have it, but I assured her that's not the case and told her she shouldn't feel guilty and to just focus on enjoying her bike.

My husband hasn't stopped grilling me about how I disrespected and undermined him and managed to make our daughter hate him after making him look like the bad guy, I again said he shouldn't have touched the bike, end of the story/// He's called me theif and juvenile for taking money from his savings and being sneaky about it.

"title: AITA for using my moms religion against her after insulting my sons hair?
content: I (32F) was raised Mormon but I’m not now, nor do I follow any other religion. My mom is still very much in the cult. As such, she has the typical Mormon mindset regarding gender roles and all that bullshit. Granted, I still think she’d be this way without her religion, though maybe not as bad. We get along splendidly, except when the topic of her religion comes up, which doesn’t often.

She’s visiting right now. I don’t see her in person much but she came down for my birthday. It’s also important to note that I have two sons. My 5 year old has a Mohawk. My 3 year old has shaggy, shoulder length hair. He’s never had a haircut for a multitude of reasons, none of which would even be asked if he were a girl. 

Not long after she got here, she started going in on his hair. This is not the first time she’s given her opinion on it. Why don’t I cut it? Don’t I want to prevent him from being bullied? Or from people thinking he’s a... GIRL??? Because he hasn’t asked and I want it to be his choice. Because he acts like I’m murdering him when I brush his teeth and hair. Because he also flails around like he’s having an exorcism so imagine that with a pair of scissors. Because if someone sees long hair and assumes “girl,” that’s on them and a simple “he’s a boy” corrects it. But mostly it’s because I don’t fucking want to. 

She got pissed and said what she really thought, which was: “Well I just don’t like long hair on boys.” Clearly. Yet she has no problem with my other sons MOHAWK. Guess that’s boyish enough for her. AND she said it in front of both my sons, which pissed ME off. 
I said the first thing which came to my head, which was: “If you have a problem with long hair on boys, I suggest you take it up with your lord and savior Jesus Christ. You can start by asking him to get a haircut. Call John the Barber.”

Bruh. If looks could kill, I’d be in outer darkness right now. She steeped in her anger for a while but didn’t say anything else. She hasn’t changed her opinion nor will she, but I don’t think she wants to get roasted again either so she won’t bring it up anymore. 

I feel like we’re both assholes. As much as I hate her religion, that was also a low blow and I have a tendency to speak first, regret later. Though I don’t necessarily regret my words, I do regret how they made her feel. She is my mom after all.

Update: Oh my Heavenly Father, I didn’t expect this at all. Thanks for the rewards and honest responses. I’m glad I could make so many of you laugh. I’m here all night. Seriously though, working until 7 am and gonna waste it all reading comments. See you all in the telestial kingdom.",nta

He labored under the delusion he was an excellent boss and couldn’t put together that his behavior and the crappy pay was why he had such a hard time keeping employees. He also thought it was acceptable to call his female employees hun, sweetie, and sugar. He was a condescending asswipe who consistently passed over more qualified women for promotions in favor of promoting less qualified men. I had to stay until I could find a better job because I enjoy eating, and couldn’t afford to leave unless I had something else. I got an interview with a competitor who hired me on making more than I made with him. 

I turned in my two weeks and he said “oh sweetie, you know you can’t leave.” I said I absolutely am leaving. He got the smuggest look on his face and said “Well, I’m not accepting this, sugar.

Effective immediately.” Called my new job, explained what happened in front of him as he sat there slack jawed and agreed start the next day. I packed my stuff and left. 

A former coworker said it was an asshole thing for me to just up and quit on the spot, but if he refused to accept the resignation he could easily have tried to screw me over when my last day did come. My new boss says he deserved it and I’m not the asshole for quitting like I did. My boyfriend says he can see how other employees might feel like I was an asshole by making them cover my absence, but sees how I’m not the asshole for walking out of that toxic environment. So just because I’m curious, I thought I’d ask here. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for walking out on my job?
content: I(29f) work as a waitress at a restaurant with a point system. It's 1 point if you are late, 3 points to call off with notice, and 5 points for calling off within 4 hours of your shift. This is fine with me as I have no points this year and have only called off once since 2018. I'm the type who covers shifts, stays late and generally just go to do my job.

Last week, I ended up calling off and was out for a week due to being hospitalized in the ICU with a horrible infection. I let my boss know at 2am that I was being sent out by helicopter and kept her informed of everything going on. Today was my first day back. I'm not 100% yet but like many places, we are short staffed. When I came in today, I opened and got to work. My boss came in 2 hours later and called me into her office. She informed me I was getting 8 points, losing my discounts and bonuses for 90 days, and was on probation. I was dumbfounded and told her I wasn't signing the papers as it was out of my control. She said if I didn't, I would be terminated. I told her not to bother and walked out. 

I'm now getting calls and texts from her and my coworkers saying they need me and I was an ass for quiting over something so small. My husband thinks I was in the right because it was ridiculous that I was getting punished for almost dying.

"title: AITA for wanting my daughter’s boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?
content: I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",nta
"title: AITA for watching GoT on an airplane?
content: Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat. Since I haven't seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. While I agree with that, I told her that I'm not going to turn it off. She then basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me. Is she right?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- I was wearing headphones all the time.

\- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However, none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.

\- I'm not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.",yta
"title: AITA for watching and doing nothing to help my husband when he was extremely ill?
content: My (27f) husband ""Tim"" (36m) has a serious dairy allergy. I'm talking about an actual immune system reaction, not intolerance. His allergy is serious enough to cause acute Enterocolitis, but he hasn't needed an epi-pen since he was a kid.

I work full time and also have some seasonal work this holiday season because Tim has been without work, and money has been very tight. As a result, I barely get to rest. The holiday are especially hard, and I found myself getting just one day off every 2 weeks for almost 2 months straight. As you can imagine, that day off means the universe to me. 

Now, Tim LOVES dairy, and will sometimes intentionally eat things which trigger his allergy. Lately, it's gotten out of hand, with him going from one risky meal every 4-6 months, to every 2 or so weeks. In fact, it always seemed to coincidentally line up with my time off, and I found myself spending my one day taking care of him. Last week, I finally asked him if he was intentionally timing it to line up with my day off. I fully expected him to say no, but he admitted that he was doing it to make sure that he'd have a nurse, and so he'd have someone close by in case he had an especially adverse reaction and needed a hospital. I was livid, and told him that he was selfish, robbing me of my rest. I said that if he made himself sick again, I wouldn't take care of him. I'm exhausted and I need to decompress. He didn't say much, so I thought he'd heard me.

Fast forward to Friday night. I get home from work, and a few minutes in, Tim gets a pizza delivered. I ask him why, when I'm making dinner and he shrugs. I ask if a large garlic Alfredo pizza is worth the pain, and remind him that I won't be giving up my rest day again. He smirks and eats an entire slice while grinning at me. I left it at that and went back to my dinner.

Predictably, he got sick, profusely vomiting, retching and groaning from the intense cramping and diarrhea. I slept in the guest room to get away from the sound and smell. He called for me several times and I repeatedly told him no. Hours later, he was still sick and woke me up at the crack of dawn to go get him pedialyte and meds because he was very dehydrated and still in pain. I told him to order it in and asked him to get out and let me sleep. 

He was still whimpering when I eventually got up to shower and eat. Again, I did nothing to help or comfort him. By evening, he was sulking, and by morning when I had to work, he was enraged. He yelled, and by the end of the day he'd told our friends and family that he nearly died and I neglected him. His family accused me of passively trying to kill him. His mom called, shouting that he could've had a life threatening reaction due to my petty actions, and that I'm a shit wife for not minding his health.
I'm starting to feel guilty because she's right and he could've been seriously hurt.

TLDR; AITA for doing nothing to help my husband after he suffered an acute allergic reaction which he intentionally triggered?",nta
"title: AITA for wearing a wedding dress at a wedding?
content: So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.

A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn’t. I’m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.

I didn’t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.

After ten minutes my friend’s fiancé walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.

He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn’t know this was the wedding.

I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.

I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn’t bother her after that and the party soon ended.

I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.

That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.

She didn’t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it’s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.

I’ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn’t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.

So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?

Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I’m also Australian and I’ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy. Everyone was dressed up in funny costumes

"title: AITA for writing a bad yelp review about my childs daycare calling them racist
content: **UPDATE: i haven't logged into this account in a while but i tried to update and it got removed so i will just copy and paste it into here**

**I decided to ask my daughter how she feels about all of this and she said that she likes going to daycare and that all of her friends are there. I got a lot of nice replies and awards and i am very thankful for all of the support i have been getting. I'm having my daughter come home from school with her grandma instead of the daycare. I emailed the owner of the daycare franchise (not the manager) and they are very furious and have decided to let go the people who were participating in this. I am not going to report them yet unless they do this again and i am in a group chat with the parents and i told them to all tell me if they do this to their kids again and i am afraid that reporting the place could make a lot of the people who didn't know about this lose their jobs. Turns out the manager and her friends were just power tripping. I am not very confrontational and my husband also said reporting would not be a good idea since if they close down other parents would lose childcare.**

A while ago my daughter\[8f\] was complaining about her daycare because they were not giving her sunscreen. she asked for sunscreen but they said that black people do not need sunscreen but they actually do. before covid they went on a field trip and they made all the black kids sit in the sun and made the white kids sit in the shade because it would damage their skin or some bs. i talked to the ladies at the daycare and they said that it was justified but said if we brought in a doctors note they would give her sunscreen. i made my daughter take it to school and let her share it with other kids but then the teacher took it saying she was not allowed to do that without permission. The other day she came home with a bad sunburn and her skin was peeling and i had enough and wrote that they were racist and segregating kids and that she could get skin cancer because they are forcing her in the sun without sunscreen. i sent the lady in charge articles about cancer and that black people can get sunburned and sent her names of the workers who enforced this. she said that they were under her orders and that she was right because we have more protection against this and said that i was blowing this out of proportion and asked me to take my review down. I am seriously thinking of contacting a news channel about this. my friend said i am being a karen for complaining publicly and that black people have melanin so that gives them lots of protection that other kids dont have

"title: AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face
content: My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

"title: AITA for yelling at my husband and telling him to get over himself after he threw away my tampon box?
content: 
We (Me 27, him 30) together for 3, married for 2 months.


So here's a thing, I used to use pads for my periods but recently was able to start using tampons (I have medical problems) in comparison, Tampons work 10x better for me, especially when I'm outside...say like at work or traveling. My husband Ryan hates them, he never truely gave a reason other than just say...he doesn't feel comfortable with *me* using *them* . I didn't think it was a big deal at first since he said he hates a lot of stuff that I do but ""puts up"" with it anyway except for this. He asked that I go back to using pads but I made it clear since it's my body then I get to decide.


He threw away some tampons he had access to, and I was getting upset but*!!!!* to keep the peace, I just bought a box and hid it away from him. he somehow found it and threw it away. I didn't find that out til I had my period yesterday and realized I had no tampons to use. I was tired, and too stressed I just yelled at him after he admitted to throwing away the whole box. He argued that I already knew how he felt about *this stuff* and yet I decided to still *keep it around*. I lost it and told him he had no right to do this and told him to get over himself already. He stared at me almost about to tear up or something, then walked out.


He later went on about how we, as a couple should take each other's discomfert into consuderation and said he already tried to speak to me about those tampons yet I brushed him off and insulted him and verbally abused him. He also said that if I still insist on using them then I should do it while I'm outside the house but I said that it won't happen. I feel bad for how it played out but I was just at my wet's end and in so much pain I lashed out.

"title: AITA fot kicking out my daughter after she tried to send my cat to the shelter?
content: Throw away for obvious reasons. TLDR at the end.

&#x200B;

the relevant backstory: I have two daughters, one is 21 and in college, the other is 26 and because of a lot of factors finds herself pregnant, divorcing her husband and needing to live in our house for the foreseeable future and I am happily married to their mother.  The other notable character is my cat Lieutenant (we call her Leut). I found Leut in a dumpster almost ten years ago when she was only a week old, got her to the vet and she has been my best buddy for the last decade. She is now my grumpy old little shadow whenever i'm home.

&#x200B;

so yesterday I came home from work and I hear my eldest daughter calling me from the kitchen. my wife and eldest then tell me that ""Leut is getting old dad, and with the baby coming we didn't think it was safe to keep an old grouchy cat around an infant. So we made the decision today to send Leut to a shelter so that she can find a family that is more in line with what she needs.""

&#x200B;

I told them both they were WAY out of line (not in so many words) and we would talk when we get back. I drive to the closest shelter, fine Leut, prove ownership, pay the $100 fee to get her back, and take her home.

&#x200B;

So here is the drama part: When I get home I call a family meeting and tell my eldest she doesn't get to make decisions about my pets without consulting me, Leut only wants to be left alone and even if it came to it i would rather exhaust all my options before putting Leut through life at a shelter. My eldest began arguing with me that Leut would be a liability around an infant and she is unpredictable (untrue, she is either asleep, sitting on her cat tree or eating). At that point i saw red and told her my cat is well trained, and dared her to come up with one instance of Leut even scratching someone, which she couldn't but kept insisting that old cats are inherently dangerous for kids. I then told herthat she had one month to get a new place to live as she clearly doesn't respect me or my things, and that if Leut so much as lost a whisker, I would hold her personally responsible.

&#x200B;

My wife and younger daughter are now begging me to change my mind as with my eldest's current financial condition i would probably be condemning her to homelessness, and that my daughter should come before a cat.

AITA for kicking my daughter out after she tried to get rid of my cat?

TLDR: eldest daughter decided to send my elderly cat to a shelter over fears she would harm her baby when the child is born. I kicked her out. AITA?

Edit to add:

As many people have brought up, no i am not being as hard on my wife as my daughter. My wife came up to me last night and basically begged for forgiveness, saying she wasn't thinking and just accepted the things my daughter was saying without checking  (very out of character for her). So I have told her i will need some space for the foreseeable future but that she and I are ok.

&#x200B;

Leut is already microcipped and wears a collar and tag. I have also contacted all the shelters around my area and sent them Leut's picture chip ID and my contact information and an explanation that i am worried someone may surrender my cat without my permission.",nta

"title: AITA if I ""cancel"" Christmas because I can't afford it this year?
content: Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure as a husband and father, so what say you here?

THIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.

INFO (And I am so sorry for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence, but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck it up as bad as I did without asking for help. 

As for all the people begging me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2 year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her ""stuff"".  She already has ""stuff"".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with ""stuff"".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness, and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on me.

Update for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.

Update for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare, as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her to ""retire"" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5 at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2, and be able to start 3 day a week ""preschool"" for far less than the cost of 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care, so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to turn around and ""bless"" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.

Lastly (hopefully, I know this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help, please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.  

I still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will be more than enough.


UPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids, we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts to your local charities. I have more than enough ""things"" and taking things from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on ""giving"" generously this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a ""new tradition"" that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.

To those of you who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and ""not bothered to budget for it once it came"" are greatly underestimating how much fertility treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful for that now.",nah
"title: AITA lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging
content: Asking for blunt honesty here because I can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if I've been an asshole and if so I'll go and apologise. 

I'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

This women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

Anyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

So for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

So a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)

""Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.""

I did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.

I can't deal with this nonsense and I'm just going to accept whatever judgement is given and go with that.",nta
"title: AITA my classmate ""saved goldfish"" by releasing them into the ocean, I called her a dumbass
content: My classmate recently made a tiktok and she showed a group of people at lunch time it. They were next to our table so I overheard the girl say ""hey look at my tiktok I made come check it out"" and in it she explains how she ""rescued"" goldfish from the pet store and released them into the ocean so they can live free. 

I was horrified upon hearing this, I love fish and have several aquariums so I'm fairly knowledgeable on them. I walk over and I ask her to show me the video and I face palmed, she asked me why and I said ""you realize you're actually a dumbass right, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen"" her friend says ""well that's just rude, why would you say that, because she cares?"" to which I had to explain that goldfish are freshwater fish, they can't survive the ocean because its saltwater so all of those goldfish were dead in minutes. They basically choked to death as salt filled up their gills. Lastly, you never release animals into the wild. There are goldfish that are destroying our rivers and lakes because of dumbasses like her. 

They say that I'm a bully and walk away. I later get called into the principal's office who told me I was expected to apologize, and I said no, I stand by what I said. Fuck ignorant people who destroy the environment. My parents were called over and I got sent home and my parents are pissed I refused to apologize. I might get suspended.",nta
"title: AITA telling the truth in the wedding toast?
content: I'm a 30 year old male and my best friend got married last week.  I just bought a house and my wife is expecting out son in November, so I let him know I was limited in what I could contribute financially, but did tell him I would try my best.  So, I wend to the bachelor party in Maine, I rented the tux, and paid for mine and my wife's dinner at the rehearsal dinner.  I also had a gift of $300 that I was going to give them, but we will get to why I didn't give it to them.

His (now wife, then fiance) texted me multiple times a day with updates--fine.  I didn't always respond and it got to the point where if I didn't repsond at LEAST once a day, I'd get a call from my buddy.  (I have a full time job and am redoing some rooms in my house, so I'm busy.)  She texted me for the following reasons:

1.  My wife was NOT allowed to talk about our pregnancy, at all.  She didn't want anyone to focus on that more than her, the bride.
2. She was NOT going to order special food for my wife (no one asked her to, my wife was fine with whatever she was going to be served.)
3. I was not helping the groom enough, he had to help her with favors, seating charts and programs, so I had to help him with those things, according to her.  She also said to get ready to help with thank you notes after the wedding.
4. She said if I was a true best man, I would offer to pay for the bar bill.  I don't even know what that means.
5. She had to read a approve my speech before the rehearsal dinner and wanted to be include as much, as my buddy.  She told me to make up things if I had to.  I was also NOT allowed to include anyone but the two of them and no inside jokes or stories about my buddy that didn't include her.
6. Her last text said to tell my wife to keep it together and not make a pregnancy scene during the wedding. Also, she wanted her to choose a dress that downplayed her pregnancy as much as possible.

I was just so aggravated, I spoke to my friend to see if he could reason with her.  He told me to just play ball on this one, it's her day and to cut him a break, because he'd be dealing with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I was annoyed but calmed down.

The day of, all the bride and my buddy do is scold me, berate me and bark orders.  I head down to the bar for the a drink...the bride's mother is there and warns me not to get drunk because I've ruined her daughter's day enough.  Final straw.

I didn't give them the card with the cash and in the speech, I used my friend's exact wording about having to deal with her nonsense for the rest of his life.  I wished them the best and told him I'd always be there for him, especially during the divorce.  AITA?",esh
"title: AITA...For telling my wife ""I warned you"" when our son got a lock for his room?
content: So here's the problem, My son Simon (16) moved out of the room he used to share with his little brother and got his own room a few months back. Eversince, he's been complaining about his mom barging in without knocking and interrupting his sleep and studying. Sometimes when he's changing...I know that she's his mother but he says he's got his own room and has a job and is learning to become an independent adult but
doesn't feel like his privacy is being respected even when that's his mom. He says he's not a kid anymore and is entitled to at least get a knock on the door before she comes in.

He was getting tired of her not listening to him 
So he came to me and said ...dad, you need to help me set some clear boundaries with mom. So I spoke to her about her need to knock before entering Simon's room. She was like what? And no, we're family, not strangers...do you really expect me to foolishly knock on the door 5 times a day?...that's ridiculous!!! Also the...""who knocks doors in their own home?"". I told her my family for instance.
She made a face then went on a rant about how my family hate each others and the way they treat each others like they were strangers is shameful.
I told her family or strangers it's about respecting one's privacy. We had an argument about it and
I told her if she wasn't going to stop with the barging and refuse to knock on the door before entering then our son will get a lock.

She did it again at 11pm, she barged in when our son was asleep he jumped up because he got scared.
Once he told me this I told him to go ahead and get a lock and pay for it with his own money, there was literally no other way.

My wife saw it and got upset and my brother was visiting when she was raising her voice at me
questioning if *I* really went ahead and got a lock for Simon despite her disapproval and said that I caught her off guard and it's not okay because this teaches our children that they can 'manipulate' one parent into doing what they want. I told her that A. Simon got the lock not me and B. I already warned her about the possibility of him getting a lock because he was getting tired of her boundary crossing. So she should've expected this outcome.

She mentioned the same above points in her defense and said locks means secrets and that's not good. My brother was sitting watching while she was complaining, She began chewing him out when he asked her to let simon keep the lock and said it wasn't a big deal.
She stopped talking to me and Simon til we remove the lock but I've no intentions on doing that.

"title: AITA: For not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?
content: I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

The last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn’t want her boys to see it. 

Now it’s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. 

Now I’m back she’s started a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I’m on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

I personally think I absolutely should not be hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking it’s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house I’m living in.

Edit: for more info, this isn’t a random house I’ve moved back into. I’ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

So this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",nta
"title: AITA? For refusing to let MIL spend the night in my bedroom and lock the door?
content: 

Context: my husband (m34) and I (f26) got married 9 months ago, we live in a different town from his parents, and his mom visited us unexpectedly on friday. 

Now to give some context about my MIL, She is okay-ish but has no respect for her son's privacy and by extension, mine. 

When it was time to go to bed, MIL requested that we let her sleep in the bedroom, on the master bed, not just that but lock the door as well because she explained she can't feel comfortable enough to sleep without locking the door. I found this bizzare but I politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. My husband agreed but I said no. This initiated an argument between her and I. During the argument I pointed put how I didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying ""Don't you just stand there! Say something!"". My husband told me to let her it's just one night, but I told her those were all the options I had for her and if she didn't like them then I could book her in a hotel. She took it as in I was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. 

She left at 12am and my husband blew up saying I disrespected his mom who was a GUEST at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and I acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. The next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards MIL abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how I keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away.

"title: AITA? Husband threw a BBQ party for his friends. I refused to help. Party was a disaster.
content: Disclaimer: we are all vaccinated.


So, my husband likes to invite his friends (note: HIS friends. I am not close with them) for barbecue parties. He prides himself on his BBQ skills. The thing is... I always end up doing everything! He buys and preps the meat and then grills and serves it (and collects praise for his BBQ skills). I have to buy drinks, get out enough dishes, clean up the patio/deck (non native speaker, idk which one to use). I prepare the sides and veggies, I refill the drinks and take away dishes (we don’t use paper plates or plastic cups since I find it wasteful) so as to keep the main table tidy. It’s just nonstop work for me. 


He just told me last week that he invited his friends for Saturday (so yesterday). Just announced it, didn’t ask me. I said well okay, do I know anyone? Nope, those are his work mates and they won’t be bringing their spouses. My husband called it a “guys’ night”. I said okay then, guys’ night, well enjoy yourselves, I will be in my craft room working on some of my projects and drinking wine. He said he will handle it.


Spoiler alert, he did not handle it. He got the meat alright, but just ignored any other preparation and I was just so sick and tired of being taken for granted (he never -asks- me for help, I just do stuff...) so I didn’t do anything. The patio was a mess, the upholstery of the garden furniture was all messy from our dogs, the table wasn’t wiped down, there was stuff lying all around. His friends arrived, I welcomed them and then excused myself to my crafts room, put some music on and worked. Cue the messages.


He started asking for stuff, like where are the plates (we only keep a small set in the kitchen, the rest is in the basement), where are the cups, why isn’t the beer chilled, where is the non alcoholic beer - did I not buy it? Where are the sides? I just replied that he said he would handle it all himself.  (EDIT: this is also where I fee I might have been the asshole, it would have taken me just minutes to at least tell him where the stuff is)


I checked on the guys a few hours later and it was a disaster. Table all cluttered, they ordered some takeout as sides, there weren’t enough dishes and silverware, someone had to go drive for drinks. 


On Sunday (today) he was all grumpy and actually told me that he is disappointed that I didn’t pull my weight and that I made our family look sloppy and bad. I told him that I am not his little housewife and that he is a big guy and if he embarrassed himself in front of his work mates, that’s all on him. And that I’m glad that he can see at least a tiny bit of work that I do around the house. He got upset and went for a run to let off some steam. 


Oh and the patio is full of dishes, he didn’t even clean the grill. I’m not touching anything.

Edit/update: thank you for the comments, this made me realize I am at fault as well - for tolerating this for so long. I went out to clear my head (my husband came back from his run and is pointedly not speaking to me) and reconsider many things in our marriage.

Edit/update2: maybe a similar story was posted before, apparently more husbands are assholes. Feel free to post the link to the supposedly identical post I copied this from, go ahead. 

And please don’t give this awards, this is a throwaway account that I plan to abandon in a few days at most.",nta
"title: AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don’t want to do that.
content: My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That’s fine with me.

His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don’t like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex’s cash cow and that’s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won’t even describe her as nice to me.

When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

I don’t want to do that. I don’t need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don’t want recognition for paying 70% of his gift’s cost but I don’t want to share my and my husband’s gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

I don’t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we’ve never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don’t understand what’s so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

I know that many people will say that it’s better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I’m civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I’m not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",esh
"title: AITA? My mom is an influencer. I am sick of being a part of it, I had ""NO PHOTOS"" hoodies printed for me and my little sister.
content: I am a teenager and my mom is kinda famous on Instagram and blogging. She had a mommy blog all when I was growing up and of course me and my sister were always involved. 

It sucks because there's so much our there about us and it's what's gonna come up when I'm looking for a job, when I'm dating, when anyone looks up my name.

I found a website that will print custom jackets, print all over the front and back and arms... And I ordered some hoodies that say a bunch of phrases all over them.

""No photos"" ""no videos"" ""i do not consent to be photographed"" ""no means no"" ""respect my privacy"" ""no cameras"" ""no profiting off my image""

It sounds silly but it looks pretty sick actually. I got one for me and one for my nine year old sister who's started to not always want photos.

And I guess the idea is that my mom can't take good looking pictures, even candid ones, with us in the hoodies without them having a pretty strong message that we don't want to be in pictures.

My mom was mad when they showed up, and really mad when I'm wearing mine. Like she says she just wants pictures to remember my young years by, she won't post ones without asking

But I know that's a whole mess anyway; she always says that and then negotiates me into letting her post, like either by saying that's how she makes income so if I want money for something, to stop arguing about pictures. Or posting without asking and then saying I thought it would be ok because you're face wasn't visible / you're just in the background, etc.

And I'm always like ""no you didn't THINK. if you thought at all you'd remember what I said I want. No new pictures of me or mentions of me online. Remove all pictures that include me that you've ever posted. and delete any writing that mentions me. 

I am just so fed up, and upset that my mom is mad at me for wearing my new hoodie everyday. She's mad I won't take it off for any event and thinks it's inappropriate to wear to certian things.

I know it's really weird looking but it feels like my only option.

Edit to add a couple more things... She also says all the mentions of consent and ""no means no"" and ""this body is my own"" (sorry forgot to mention that one earlier) imply something more inappropriate and that it is really inappropriate to wear those words out in public. We've also fought about me wearing it to family events and school events with a generally dressier dress code, because it looks like a ""gangster hoody"". I don't know what to say to that, but I don't agree

"title: AITA? Suing my neighbor after she sprayed weedicide on my lawn
content: Caught my neighbor spraying weedicide on my lawn (in my fenced in backyard) because she said “she was sick of all the weeds” and thought she was doing me a solid.

1. I like dandelions they are good for the bees

2. I have pet rabbits, dogs, cats, and a tortoise i like to roam the yard and all of them eat or at least nibble and lick the grass so it’s literally poisoning my pets.

So anyway, I kick her the fuck out and take all my pets inside.

Now 2 of my rabbits are dead and another is in critical condition. I’ll never be able to let my pets outside again to eat the grass because weedicide takes forever to go away because it can sit in the soil for who knows how long and Im worried that the dogs and cats might end up having a reaction too since they also nibble the grass (call me overprotective or over cautious IDC I love my animals) 

So I’m suing her for: damage to my property because it is now unusable for my animals, veterinary bills, and emotional damage due to the deaths of my two rabbits.

I’m also trying to get the cops to pursue a case of animal abuse or at minimum criminal damage because she did basically poison my animals but I doubt anything will come from it because I have to prove ill-intent but they are pursuing her for criminal trespass. 

She’s a Karen. I think she deserves it for thinking she had any right to be on my property at all; and especially because it’s killed my pets and now Idk what to do about my lawn because I’m not risking another animal’s life by letting them out (at least unsupervised for at least a year. However my parents and my girlfriend think I’m being unnecessarily cruel because it “was an accident and she thought she was just being a good neighbor, and that Im making it to be a bigger deal than it is” and should just ask for her to pay my vet bills

Edit: info, she has asked me about the weeds before

I don’t remember it verbatim but Basically the conversation was along the lines of

Her: “hey I see you have a lot of dandelions/ weeds have you noticed that too” 

Me: “yup i enjoy the look of a natural lawn” 

Her: “Something about my new car.”

The end

Since she has a kid that she always asks can come over to play with my rabbits I assumed she knew they ate them if she was looking over my fence that often she’d notice the dandelions were only ever flowering in 1/4 of the lawn at a time because my rabbits got cycled in a way that most of the lawn was mostly weed free while the part they couldn’t get to that week would be sprouting

Edit again: thanks for the messages guys. Im taking the advise and getting a security camera and a padlock for the fence; also i am in fact getting a necropsy done.

Edit edit edit: i have talked to her. Told her that my rabbits died after the fact and there was staining on their pen. She said “it’s weedicide not pesticide; they were probably just sick”

Edit edit edit (last edit this is blowing up too much I gotta walk away sorry if i didn’t answer your question) but my rabbits were actually outside when she did this and there was a stain on their pen. I can’t prove it but Im pretty sure they got a direct spray.

UPDATE: I got a call from my vet monday morning the necropsy is back my rabbits died from corrosion to several internal organs and had corrosive burns lining their mouth and nose. 

My 3rd rabbit can also come home today and only has minor injuries to his throat and a small injury resulting in superficial hair loss and mild irritation on his nose. He’ll be on pain meds and just in case I have critical care ready 

For those without rabbits when rabbits are in pain and sometimes in mourning they sometimes refuse to eat so critical care is basically a mix powder you can syringe feed to keep their digestive system functioning because GI stasis can be life threatening.

Also I’ve contacted a lawyer to move forward with a lawsuit, but they haven’t responded, probably won’t until later today because i contacted them yesterday through email. 

And for the lawn and garden people from my last post the vet thinks the stuff the neighbor used wasn’t a commercial herbicide because of those chemical burns as well as because it killed my crabapple tree and the bit near my fence and pool are bare.

Please in the future; avoid messaging me for updates 

I have no reason to keep you guys updated for any reason; my life and my animals at the end of the day is my business not yours. I will try to keep you updated but remember this is my LIFE. Getting a message every day asking for an update IS RUDE. Also definitely NEVER EVER comment on another one of posts asking for updates or for information that’s just beyond rude STOP IT. Im allowed to make other posts without being reminded of this; you’ll get updates as they come and as I please not as you demand. Thank you.",nta

To me this is a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

After a while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

I was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones.

"title: Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?
content: My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”.",nta
"title: Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?
content: 
This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",nta
"title: META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world
content: I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”",nta
"title: So we decided to fuck with the sub.
content: # Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub. 

---

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",nta
"title: UPDATE Am I the asshole for cutting up and altering my wedding dress into a functional dress insetad of giving it to my sister who can't afford it?
content: Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/erfvwt/aita_for_cutting_up_and_altering_my_wedding_dress/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I posted approximately 5 months ago about my sister being mad at me for not giving her, what was supposed to be, my wedding dress.

So after being assured that I did nothing wrong I decided to try to talk it out with my sister. So I tried calling her but she had blocked my number. I was very Confused and talked to my mother. She was trying to still stay out of it and I got a little mad and said that it was not fair. That my sister was not right because she never formally asked me and how was I supposed to just guess that she wanted it. She tried to justify her but in the end also accepted that my sister was wrong. Non the less she told me to just give her space and that she will just come to terms with it herself.

I waited a few days till I met her in the supermarket. At first she tried to act like she didn't see me but I planted myself infront of her. She was just rolling her eyes saying she had places to be. And I just said ""you know I hope you notice how unfair you are treating me"" and then left her alone.

That night I received a call where I was berated for being selfish for about 20 minutes by her. I asked her if she was done and asked her if we could talk it out like adults. She came over the next night and we had an exhausting fight. Screaming crying and after all was said and done she actually apologized for everything. She was kind of jealous of my dress and of the wedding I almost had. And she was embarassed that she couldn't afford everything I could and that she felt like she failed as an adult and as a mother. And honestly I get it. Not because I think she is a failure, but because I get how it feels if your brain tells you you failed at life because you don't have things that other people have. She apologized also because she was trying to blame me for her problems and that everything was easier if she wasn't the one to blame. We talked a lot more time till I told her that she didn't need a fancy dress and that we could search something basic and I could help her to decorate it with something. She agreed and we actually did get to customize a very basic gown. As we didn't have much time it's not super fancy. Sadly due to the outbreak the wedding, that was supposed to happen this month, was canceled. They had a courthouse wedding where she wore one of my dresses and she is celebrating in August if it's possible.

That's everything. So even if I was not an asshole and my sister seemed like a brat... She was dealing with some heavy feelings and I still love her. 

Thanks for the judgment and advice.",info
"title: UPDATE ~ AITA For walking out on a double date my friend set up with him, his girlfriend and a girl I had already rejected before
content:  It has been a little under 2 months and I have received quite a few requests to make an update over the past 9 or so weeks, looking at you SnooChipmunks3950 , at first I was going to make one a week or 3 ago but I decided against it and instead chose to wait till I had some proper updates, but well, here goes.

Previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita\_for\_walking\_out\_on\_a\_double\_date\_my\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita_for_walking_out_on_a_double_date_my_friend/)

At any rate like I said, here goes. It turns out that some of the more pessimistic of you were right, Jane was being obsessive and stalkerish and it sort of all came tumbling down on her at that point. A week or so after I made my post she decided to message me, well it came down to her not understanding why I was showing interest in her and then refused to date her(I never showed interest in her beyond basic friendliness.), A wall of text dedicated to thrashing my previous relationships and calling them all sorts of names, specifically pointing out how I dated the ""Wrong girls"" and a weird rant about how everyone agreed me and her were meant to be, which just isn't the case, like I said in my previous post, there is a running joke in our friend group about how weird she is.

Now, you might think this is something that can be expected, something that just happens, an outlet for her of sorts, except, she send it from the wrong account. See, I had become internet friends with a person In the past month or two, me and her would game together, chat from time to time, you know, the usual organic internet friend situation. And the messages concerning out ""Date"" were sent from this account, turns out she had literally used this alias to infiltrate my ""internet"" friend group and keep tabs on me of sorts? Obviously this freaked me the fuck out, I took screenshots of what she had sent me and afterwards blocked all accounts that I knew now she was using.

I followed that up by sharing everything in our friend discord and in our friend whatsapp group, so everyone could see which resulted in her being kicked from both and I later got a call from Joe full on apologetic, telling me he had no idea and he knew he shouldn't have done it but that his girlfriend was being pressured by Jane, turned out, Jane had literally been bitching at her for months to arrange something like this and she finally caved, again creepy stuff, I told him that I needed some time as he really fucked me over bigtime and I didn't trust him anymore as a result.

While Jane has been shunned by all friends, she still contacted me twice, once to apologize which quickly turned into weird shit where she started talking about ""Us"" she seems convinced there is an us and I am interested and another time just to curse at me, both from random accounts. I am not sure where to go from here and I am still pretty shook up.",info
"title: UPDATE: A month ago I was told I WBTA for not telling a date about my plans to be a single mother, so I told him
content: Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta\_by\_not\_telling\_a\_guy\_ive\_been\_dating\_for\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta_by_not_telling_a_guy_ive_been_dating_for_a/)

A month ago I asked if I WBTA for not telling a guy I had only started dating that I had plans to become a single mother. I was scared I'd lose him but also felt I would be deceiving him by not telling him, thus making the investment in our relationship unfair. The comments were pretty much unanimous in that I'm an asshole, and I needed to tell him, and this validated my decision to go forth and be honest, as nervous as I was.

I explained my situation about taking 2 yrs to come to this decision, how my fertility clinic had shut due to Covid which was why I had gone back onto dating apps. I explained how my clinic had reopened after meeting him, and how important it was to me to continue in my journey to become a mother. I knew this was 'baggage' he hadn't expected and that there was every chance he would step away from the situation. Well, he didn't.

We're now in a committed relationship and he's been supporting me in my journey. I've had 2 unsuccessful artificial inseminations with donor sperm (my original plan), and we've spoken about having a child together. As early on as it may seem, he told me my honesty made him consider his own future and how he really wants a family some day, and how he has admiration for me being honest about my situation and how he wants to help my fulfil my desires to be a mother, whether with him or with donor sperm - either way he wants to be a part of my life.

I wanted to provide this update as a positive outcome has come out of being labelled an asshole and it pushed me to do the right thing, which has in turn meant I have the most understanding and accepting bf. Had I kept this info from him it would have played on my conscience, as well as most likely have caused him to not trust me. So thank you : )  


EDIT - Gosh, I didn't think this post would blow up in this way. Thanks for the lovely words of support, and also those of you taking the time to provide food for thought of co-parenting and step-parenting. This is new territory for me, and I don't know anyone else in my day to day life who has been in this situation, so it's so valuable for me to hear your views and gain new perspectives. Thank you, kind Reddit community.",nah
"title: UPDATE: AITA for Trying to Send my Deaf Daughter to a School that Won't Hire an Interpreter?
content: Thank you all for your advice on my last post. I wasn't aware of all the laws about this kinda thing. For those of you who didn't read the OP basically my 6YO daughter is deaf and communicates using ASL. There is a public school near us but it's very bad and the whole district has a rating of 1.5/5 stars. All of our other children go to a private school near us. But the private school said they wouldn't pay for an interpreter because there is a deaf school in our county, but the deaf school only teaches speech and no sign language so we decided not to send her there. We also wanted her to go to the private school because there was a language option for ASL so she may be able to communicate with other classmates. But my brother said that we shouldn't push trying to get her in, if the school doesn't want her we should just give up.

Most people said to hire a lawyer. My husband decided to contact his brother who is a disability lawyer, although he specializes in wheelchair accessibility he was willing to take our case. We discussed the situation over the phone with him and then he reached out to the private school.

He emailed back and forth with the school. We're not sure what was said exactly but by the end of it, not only did the school agree to pay for the interpreter but they also provided a free scholarship and let us request which teacher she had which they didn't let us do for any of our other kids. There is a kindergarten teacher who knows some ASL so we chose to be in her class. I'm not sure exactly why they did this but I think it's probably because denying entry to a kindergartener just because she's deaf would not look so good if other people found out. But I'm not complaining.

She started 2 weeks ago and she loves it(They are doing hybrid) she is able to make friends and talk to other kids(Though in kinda broken sign language). Her interpreter is very nice and will update us on how she did everyday unlike the interpreter she had when she was in public school. Her teacher also tried to sign when she's speaking as much as possible and so do some of the kids. Overall I'm so happy this happened and I wouldn't have known there was anything I could do about it until I asked on here, so thank all of you who replied to the OP and told me they do have to provide an interpreter for her.

Edit: My pronouns are She/Her, I'm not sure why everyones referring to me as a male but just wanted to let you all know.

Edit 2: To everyone concerned as to why my BIL is a disability lawyer but I came to reddit first: We barely talk to BIL. He's my husbands half-brother and there is a 16 year age gap so they aren't close. And at the time when I first posted I didn't think I could do anything legally(I talked about why in the comments) so I didn't even think of talking to my BIL. I was just concerned if I was being too pushy which is why I came to this sub rather than legal advice. Hope that clears some things up.",nta
"title: UPDATE: AITA for making a dad joke?
content: My son found the post, and shared it with my daughter. This was after apologizing to her. She cried again. 
  
So last week, we decided to have a father/daughter bonding weekend. Honestly, it was awesome. I took her bowling, to get a manicure, becoming Disney princesses(I looked awesome as Jasmine), and so forth. She loved it. I loved it. Everyone was happy. Then we decided to go out to eat dinner. “I’m starving, what do you want Maddie?” “Hi Starving, I’m not your daughter”. She had this biggest smirk on her face. She hugged me and I kissed her forehead. I’m sure she’d been planning this for weeks.

"title: UPDATE: AITA for refusing to put my BF on the title of my house or make him a beneficiary
content: Update on my last post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j6r1oi/aita\_for\_refusing\_to\_put\_my\_bf\_on\_the\_title\_of\_my/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j6r1oi/aita_for_refusing_to_put_my_bf_on_the_title_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I listened to a lot of your feedback and talked to my BF after my post. He seemed weird in our talk. (He's been weird a lot lately, but I have been excusing it.) He told me that he said to put him on as an insurance beneficiary partially as a joke but then when I ""went off"" on my tangent (including offering up that he'll never go on my house title either even though he never mentioned it) that he got offended and reacted poorly. He said he really did think I was going off about all that in retaliation for his ""no to marriage"" talks so he was left with a bitter taste. Which...I get. I can be more forceful than I realize and I am naturally passive aggressive. He said I didn't have to put him on anything but he needs me to understand that I am it for him. He wants to makes his life with me. Things seemed to be better after this.

That weekend he asked if I wanted to go on a hike. It was peak season for the leaves changing and there is this waterfall he suggested we go to. We get to the waterfall and he pulls an envelope out of his jacket with a tiny bow on it and says it's a present for me. I open it and it's a receipt from a jewelry store. I was confused but I see he had the date of purchase highlighted and circled with a heart - it was early August (before the talks we had where he said he never wanted to get married). I turn and there he is with a ring. I said yes.

He said he knew I would never believe that he had the ring before all this without the receipt. That his attitude and comments when I started asking about marriage was to fool me so I didn't get suspicious because this was the plan all along - he wanted an autumn proposal in a beautiful location since it's my favorite season.

Money he has been saving after moving in with me (since I charge him a much smaller amount than he was previously paying) went to the ring. He saved money for over a year because he knew when he moved in with me that he was going to eventually ask me to marry him.

So honestly this is the best case scenario! We talked after too. When we get married we will add each other as beneficiaries on our insurance policies. And we decided there's no need to put him on my title even after we get married.

I really appreciate everyone's comments on that last post! I read all of them and most people were genuinely concerned and offered wonderful advice and support.",info
"title: UPDATE: Aita if I tell my friend her bf is planning to propose?

To everyone who told me to keep my mouth shut, thank you.

So on Saturday, the day of the proposal, I got a call from her boyfriend. He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren’t there… I was fucking slack jawed. 

I told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM “you just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.”

I was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read “welcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)” and this is where things go down hill. 

I did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn’t want to change her last name, and she’s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She’s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she’s doubled down.

When she saw the sign she joked “Mrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!” Everyone went silent until his mom said “Well the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!” She takes the ring off and see’s “Mrs.(his last name)” engraved on the band.

Then she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn’t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said “This was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.”

SHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That’s when I’m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).

She was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said “does he really think I’m that shallow?” She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point. 

She’s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you’ve all helped me realize, this isn’t about me, it’s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.

Edit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn’t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.

EDIT 2 (update): I did not mention this plan when I originally posted just in case her ex found this thread, but I can report now that we got a heads up last night that he wasn’t at their apartment, so we ran over and got most of her shit out, at least all the really important stuff. To those asking, no she isn’t going back to him, it’s over.",nta
"title: UPDATE: WIBTA for reporting a coworker for feeding me?

Further detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/0587throwaway/comments/ktb7u0/peg_comments/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 
Honestly, I’ve never more immediately regretted something. This exploded. Spectacularly. 

I went to HR, saying that the matter was settled, but I wanted it documented; subsequently was told that there would be an investigation and the incidents would be corroborated with witnesses, because as is the full record I claim is “severe enough to warrant potential action” for Pey and several other coworkers who also engaged in her behavior. HR started the process, apparently immediately, because I walked in yesterday to a shitstorm. 

This plunged the department into civil war. Many agree Peg was out of line, some told me I should’ve kept the status quo, some said I was ungrateful and entitled. One said I should have handled this “maturely” and “who could blame her” when I look “like that”, and I should be ashamed of myself. Another coworker suggested I work from home. Another told me he was sorry for not stepping in. I went to go get my lunch out of the fridge only to find someone had disposed of it and left behind the empty Tupperware. Nearly everyone has an opinion. The people in my corner have advised me to keep my head down and to take care. 

My boss held a meeting, first with Peg and me, then a second with just me. During the one with Peg, I was told to apologize for my part and Peg likewise. (“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable by caring about your health.”). My boss asked if I was “satisfied now”. I brought up Peg’s comments and my boss said I invited them, no one would call that harassment, and I need to work on myself. Together we went through each of the 23 events. She excused each of them until I was left to feel like I‘d been harassing Peg.

The next meeting was even worse. Effectively Boss said, “I told you not to retaliate and instead you searched Peg out to harass her” and “your actions have expressed a worrying lack of cooperation with me and your team.” She was also disappointed that instead of explaining that I needed her to resolve things, I “escalated the situation well beyond the point of reason” and cruel to someone who only wanted to help. She said I won’t get far in life and I’m not likely to get anywhere vocationally if I can’t be a team player and “actively sabotage a happy workplace”. She hoped I will learn from this “teachable moment” how to behave in a collaborative environment as it’s inappropriate to involve HR for “small misunderstandings”. 

BF is spitting mad. I’m just... tired, confused and hurt. HR seemed sympathetic. Boss is very clearly on Peg’s side. The office is split and tense. Currently updating my resume and job searching. It really does feel like a nightmare. Haven’t felt good going in to work for a while, and this just made it times worse.",nta

Some stuff has happened recently and many of you have wanted an update on this. Appreciate the reassurance and understanding my decision when seems that many in this situation didn’t. I remained firm in my decision about not letting them use my property for their wedding. Even if they changed their mind about inviting us which honestly I don’t care about anymore. 
Rick’s family (thanks to him) got a hold of my cell so that was more people I had to deal with. I put my foot down with Rick a few days ago and told him directly that I will go to the police and press charges for harassment (I have all the texts and calls documented). Also had a very long talk with Carla about everything going on. She apologized for it all. And she knows it’s her own fault. 

Well she decided to be the one to call things off in the end. Some of my friends still seem to think it’s my fault and I’m taking some distance from them for a while. And also from Carla after getting some confirmation on a few things that I needed to know. Whole thing is a mess. I’m only glad in the end that I didn’t give in to their demands and the constant bugging has stopped.. It still was a huge headache over the last few days and not the kind of drama I want back in my life. Thank you to everyone who made me feel supported in this. It helped a lot not feeling like the only other person (aside from my wife), who thought their demand was insane and inappropriate.",info

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 11 years, since I was 15. His mother has HATED me since the first day she met me. She hated me due to my ethnicity, (Kosovan Albanian) she hated me due to my career, I work as a model and she decided that makes me an empty headed, vain, shallow person. Then when I told her I still planned to go to university alongside my career she said I was doing it to “impress” my boyfriend. I’ve since left uni with a distinction and her new reason to hate me is… I try too hard? She has also insisted I’ve cheated on him throughout our entire relationship which is a ridiculous claim, I’ve never even kissed another man in my whole LIFE. I have zero desire to cheat and never will.

Late last year she attempted to void the insurance on my boyfriend’s motorbikes, she tried to do this under my name so, hypothetically, when he was arrested for riding with no insurance and called his insurance company, I’d get the blame. After this happened my boyfriend and I agreed to cut her out, however it hasn’t stuck, she left my boyfriend alone and respected his wishes for NC but she’s continued to contact and harass me.

This leads to the last few weeks, my boyfriend works as a motorcycle test rider and he got in an awful motorbike crash while working, as such I now need to care for him. I’m okay with that and I’m focusing on seeing it as an opportunity for us to get closer, it’s been nice honestly. However his mother has been AWFUL to me. She’s called me litany of terms. From things as tame as stupid to things as awful as a “Nasty Serbian half breed.” I’m not Serbian and she’s well aware that calling a Kosovan a Serb is offensive. I tried to block her so she started making new iMessage accounts and began to continuously harass me via those accounts.

Then came Friday night. The police turned up at our door. I was pretty confused and was quickly told they were there to do a welfare check as they’d received “multiple” claims of horrific abuse I was apparently putting my poor boyfriend under. Obviously they quickly discovered he was fine, albeit grumpy and they left. I know for a fact it was his mother, some of the details the police mentioned made that obvious. 

I’m now at a point where I’ve realised I literally cannot do this. I’m going to press charges against her for the insurance and harassment (it’s a crime in the UK) and I’m likely going to sue her for damages, for the sake of my mental health I need to do this. I don’t want to be a victim and she needs to be forced to stop. I have mentioned my intentions to her if she doesn’t back off and she’s pretty much mocking me and saying I won’t. I absolutely will. I just feel like this morally may make me an awful person. She sucks, I know this, however she’s old and miserable enough as is and I feel like doing this may ruin whatever small amount of life she has left. It feels like it may be too far. I really don’t know though and I genuinely cannot be objective here.

WIBTA here if I did this?

Edit: When I say I need to care for my boyfriend, I mean he’s essentially immobile, he’s not being unsupportive, he’s just barely able to take care of himself, let alone battle his mother too.",nta
"title: WIBTA for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?
content: My daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. She has been BEGGING for a Nintendo Switch. Due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a Switch. Money isn’t the issue... it’s her behavior; she acts very entitled & she’s lying left & right. I just don’t feel now is the right time for a Switch.

The theft: 

On Easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband’s aunt & uncle’s house. Aunt & Uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we’ll call her Cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. She lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn’t get many upscale things unless they are a gift. Well, Cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. She eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

Well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

My kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. She snuck it out of Aunt & Uncle’s by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. She proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when Aunt & Uncle called & asked if we had seen where Cousin might have left it.

Due to Cousin’s challenges, she was utterly DISTRAUGHT over her missing gameboy. It’s one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

I’m disappointed about the thievery, but I’m even more upset over my kid’s attitude about being caught. I only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. Even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. It wasn’t until I sat there & thought about it that I knew she was lying to me. Once I told her I knew it had to be her because of XYZ did she finally confess. Her behavior only got worse from there. She refused to apologize when Uncle & Cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like SHE was the one being wronged. 

I feel like I need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing IS NOT OK. I think that purchasing the Switch (with my daughter’s help from money she would “earn” by doing extra chores) & having her give it to Cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving Cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

I mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... BIRTHDAY... I don’t really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. What do you think Reddit?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

Also - I do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a Switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. Not sure how or when, since I have a SO to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***Edit: I’ll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying I’m TA for being a lazy parent. Our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and I. My husband and I are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. Her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. He and his family hardly ever tell her “no” to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. I assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?
content: My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?

"title: WIBTA if I played “Another One Bites the Dust” at my brother’s wake?
content: My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it’s stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn’t Catholic and wouldn’t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn’t know there. He’d think it’s way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while “It’s Raining Men” played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like “Highway to Hell” and “Another One Bites the Dust.” 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play “Another One Bites the Dust” at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren’t very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I’ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I didn’t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don’t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn’t really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother’ s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we’re going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

Thanks again.",nta
"title: WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?
content: My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care. 

I’m in Australia, and I’m pretty sure that kind of recording is legal here.

"title: WIBTA if I refused to attend my cousins wedding after she asked me to dye my ginger hair?
content: Yes I'm aware that my cousin posted here and oh the irony as i showed her this sub last year, but I really don't care if she sees this,  maybe it'll hammer the point home. 
And I doubt she will see it as they are currently on their pre wedding honeymoon, legit didn't even know those were a thing. 
So Amy is getting married,  she has a blue and green and purple theme for the wedding. 
People are supposed to wear these colours including the moh and the bridesmaids. 
What irked me about that post was that my hair is NOT FLAMING MERIDA RED.
maybe slightly more [ginger] (https://ibb.co/w4yrCCk) in low light
This whole thing is completely insane to me and I have no idea where it has come from.

My [hair](https://ibb.co/y4dKsCZ) [2]
(https://ibb.co/3BVPgBf) [3](https://ibb.co/MD1V7NH) is what i would describe as strawberry blonde, maybe ginger blonde. 
Those are actual picture's of my hair not some poor stranger's instagram.
Things have been awkward from the start with Amy demanding that everyone has to stick to this dress code or they will be barred by security at the damn door.
She has also asked anyone with hair past their waist to cut it in a Facebook post but it got no replies and I can't think of anyone except me and maybe my sister with suoer long hair.
My mum and dad are both way more ginger than me and my sister who is 8 months pregnants hair is not much shorter than mine and is super ginger, and Amy never asked her to touch her hair? if anything I got the dull hair geane.

At first Amy called up to tell me she had made a post here,  I took a look and had to laugh to be honest,  She linked me early on clealry thinking people would agree with her but she said she was worried because it blew up. 

After things went south she decided to try and ""negotiate"" with me, still completely bizzare as my hair is not merida red.
My mum and dad called round a few days back to talk about it but got absolutely nowhere with her as she's still insisting i dye my hair a dark brown for the day or get a wig. 

My aunt,  Amy's mom called to apologise to me and asked me to please come but I don't feel welcome, can you imagine attending a wedding where the bride stares daggers at you the whole time? and what if the security refuse to let me in. 
[these](https://www.frenchnovelty.com/sean-couture-peacock-corset-back-ball-gown-prom-dress-70567) are extremely similar to the gowns the bridesmaids are going to wear, I've tired mine on and it absolutely dose not clash at all.
I brought and paid for my dress so I don't owe her anything but our families are so upset that I'm dropping out. 
But if I go I have no choice except to dye my hair as there never was a compromise or middle ground,  it was dye it,  buy a short brown bob wig or don't come. 
She specified it has to be a short brown bob wig for some reason.

WIBTA if I just say fuck it and stay home.
EDIT  also to be fair i dyed a small strand underneath to test how it washed out 4 weeks ago, it is STILL DARK BROWN",nta
"title: WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?
content: I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",nta
