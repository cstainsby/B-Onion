       "'title: AITA for leaving the call when my brother announced that his gf is pregnant?\\ncontent: My brother and I do not get on.\\n\\nWhen we were younger he\\'d go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent\\'s credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn\\'t have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.\\n\\nThere was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.\\n\\nYou really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can\\'t go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She\\'ll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that\\'s about it.\\n\\nI have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn\\'t want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?\\n\\nAnyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they\\'d hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.\\n\\nYesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we\\'re not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.\\n\\nI just froze, I didn\\'t know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.\\n\\nI received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should\\'ve just \"been a man\" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.\\n\\nI feel like maybe I shouldn\\'t have left the call but at the same time it would\\'ve been worse if I\\'d stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won\\'t be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don\\'t know what to think\\n\\nEDIT\\n\\nI just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  \\n\\nA lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren\\'t happy but they don\\'t have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can\\'t go into much detail, but he said he\\'d do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that\\'s fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.\\n\\nThe rest of the family, for the most part, weren\\'t happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that\\'s just the kind of person he is.\\n\\nI think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don\\'t want to put him through all that.\\n\\nSorry I can\\'t reply to all your comments but I\\'ve been trying to read them all. Thanks again Reddit.\\nclassification: nta'"
