# Backend Folder 
This folder will be responsible for housing anything related to the actual model and how it is interacted with. This includes the following:
1. the model itself
2. the data the model will use 
3. A dockerfile specifying how to package up my model
4. files specifying how GCP Vertex AI will interact with the custom Dockerfile

**NOTE:** the folder structure is based off [this](https://medium.com/@piyushpandey282/model-serving-at-scale-with-vertex-ai-custom-container-deployment-with-pre-and-post-processing-12ac62f4ce76) blog post
